Hey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look a=
s cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so o=
range and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I we=
nt to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. =
I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place=
 it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the Enron =
gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into th=
e free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the mea=
theads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo=
, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for =
you (maybe 9ish).=20
