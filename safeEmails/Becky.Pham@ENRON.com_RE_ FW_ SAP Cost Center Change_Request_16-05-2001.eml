We can definitely change the description names.  These cost centers have ENA=
 in them because ENA requested the move.  I will request the name changes fo=
r these cost centers to say ENW EES xxxxxxx.  If you have any questions, I c=
an be reach at 5-7094.  Thanx

All,

I have not yet gotten Don's employee information yet and am waiting until I =
can move everybody at one time so we have a clean cut-off for everyone.  If =
we have missed the May cut-off for an April 30 transition, we'll make it eff=
ective May 31.  Also, I am considering just making it effective June 30 so w=
e have a clean quarter cut-off.  So, continue to use your current cost cente=
r until you hear back from me.

Also, Kerry, is the description of the cost centers standard (the ENW ENA)? =
 Will this be confusing to existing ENA descriptions?  Would it be better to=
 call them ENA/EES or EWS/EES.

Thanks

Wade
