Cindy, I sent this to Jeff McMahon today.  I wanted you to see it.  You can =
forward it to Ken if you'd like - I am very interested in speaking with him =
as soon as that can be arranged.  I very much appreciate your insightful and=
 professional support of me in all of this from day one!  Thanks, Sherron.

Jeff, Congratulations, you deserve the job and can do it superbly!  You know=
 you will need to replace Ben Gilson as Treasurer - possibly with Bill Brown=
=2E =20

My issue, and I feel very strongly about this, is that I want to be on the c=
risis management team to determine how we save our trading franchise.  It ca=
n disappear over night and I believe there's more bad news coming re: these =
raptor deals (ie, restatement).  I have clearly proven myself to be the only=
 person at Enron that had the character, at great risk to my own career, muc=
h less personal risk, to go to Ken Lay and let him know what was going on he=
re.  I resent all these late comers joining the band wagon - it's damn easy =
to make a statement now, when Ken has made the hard decision to unwind these=
 deals and write them off.  Mainly I resent being stuffed into a holding tan=
k, I should not be the pariah here!  Despite your comment to me several week=
s ago when I told you that's how I felt and you replied "what did you expect=
?"  I have been professional in this 100%, I went to Ken and Ken alone, in c=
ontrast to yesterday's VP Jim S. who put Ken on the spot by asking unanswera=
ble questions at the all employee meeting. I hope to meet with Ken Lay soon.=
  But I'd like to talk to you about my role in the 'inner circle', because I=
 firmly believe I deserve it and have proven so by my past evaluations of th=
e negative impact of these structures and then by my actions in doing someth=
ing about it.  You can help me with your endorsement of me to Greg Whalley, =
Mark Frevert and Ken Lay.  I hope I have it.  Thanks and good luck in the ne=
w job, Sherron

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financia=
l officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterd=
ay and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investo=
r confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough =
understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the is=
sues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.=
 =20

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He jo=
ined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief finan=
cial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., J=
eff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  I=
n 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Work=
s.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share pr=
ice.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing =
Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution=
 involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals =
of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as=
 we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of yo=
ur continued hard work.
