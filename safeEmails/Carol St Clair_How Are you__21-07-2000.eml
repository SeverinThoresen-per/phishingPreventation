Cindy:
Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a=20
challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of=20
schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are=
=20
using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces=20
should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should=20
keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a nigh=
t=20
owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy=20
every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any=20
suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret=
=20
methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a=20
pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at=20
falling asleep on his own.

How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be=20
sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into=20
tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mothe=
r=20
not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she=20
took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care=20
what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobil=
e=20
which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.



Sue,
How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit s=
o=20
that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill=
=20
is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin=20
something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.


Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and=
=20
call or write me.

Love, Carol=20
