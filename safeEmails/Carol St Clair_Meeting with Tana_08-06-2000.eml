Mark and Sara:
Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how th=
e=20
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and als=
o=20
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training=
=20
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to he=
r=20
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it=20
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's=20
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am=20
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process=
=20
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.=
 =20
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't=
=20
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana'=
s=20
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to he=
r=20
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha'=
s=20
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was=
=20
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to=
=20
work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht=
=20
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the=20
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit=20
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired=20
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my=20
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her=20
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude=
=20
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this=
=20
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

Carol =20
