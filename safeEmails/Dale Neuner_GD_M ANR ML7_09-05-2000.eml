Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery=20
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widel=
y=20
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed=
=20
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would=20
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.
