I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following.

Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 (volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st).

Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 (volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st)=
=2E

The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.  This is not a bookout, =
=20
One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal=20
516286.  We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.  The volume=
=20
on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.  Just a note, since I think th=
e=20
purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the=20
month in Sitara.

I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify.
