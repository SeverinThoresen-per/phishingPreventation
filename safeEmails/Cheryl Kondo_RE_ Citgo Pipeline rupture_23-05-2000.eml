As I understand it, the meeting is planned for the full day (including=20
lunch), although I do not know the exact starting time.  John Odam, the=20
mediator, will most likely set the time.  Because Enron in-house counsel=20
duties are shifting from Kenton to Richard Sanders, Twanda Sweet (Richard's=20
assistant) will be finishing the details of the meeting.  I am forwarding th=
e=20
information I have to Twanda so she can finish up the details and get this=20
information out to all interested parties. I can tell you that the mediation=
=20
will be held at the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street in Houston.  A=20
conference room and 3-4 breakout rooms have been reserved.  If you have any=20
other questions, Twanda's # is 713-853-9402.  Richard Sanders # is=20
713-853-5587. =20
