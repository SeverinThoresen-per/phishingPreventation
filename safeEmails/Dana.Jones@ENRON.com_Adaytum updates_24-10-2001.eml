Today I updated the NNG Commercial IBIT in adaytum for the following:

added expense item - So Georgia (FAS 96) adjustment	$31,000
added expense item - Non tracked SBA-commodity 	$78,000
Adjusted ACA expense in Oct				$12,000

I did not make any other changes.

This should be final.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
