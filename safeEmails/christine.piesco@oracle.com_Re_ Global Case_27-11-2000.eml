Jeff,

Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday,=20
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on =
a=20
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:

On the expropriation:

In the write up we say "We agree with the executive that Global should repor=
t=20
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 wer=
e=20
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be=20
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major=20
industries.  "

The book says "The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a publi=
c=20
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterpris=
e=20
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises." I would argue that Matuto was=20
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office.=
=20
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.

As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and=20
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 199=
5=20
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the=20
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think=
=20
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the=20
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they=20
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not=20
accrue..

I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing=20
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon=20
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent=20
litigation should be
made.

The book states that "If there are several aspects of litigation, each of=20
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible=
=20
claim...."

Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces.=20
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been=20
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The=20
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.
