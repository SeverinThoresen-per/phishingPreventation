Tonight's mmeting was quite lively and informative.  There is a lot going on
that affect Clear Creek Village.

Donald H. Olsen, Constable Precinct 8 visited out meeting tonight.  He
reminded us to close our garage doors and lock them, especially when we leav=
e
during the day.  He also reminded us that school will be out soon and we all
need to watch the neighborhood.

City Council candidates Thomas Cones and Barbara Meeks were at tonight's
meeting and we would like to thank them for their time and interest in
meeting with the residents of Clear Creek Village.

 City council member Katie Benoit was also in attendance.  She spoke to us
about a possible $80,000 grant from the state that would pay for the 54 acre=
s
along Clear Creek at the back of Clear Creek Village, that we call the land
at the end of Audubon and Williamsport.  It might be possible that this land
could be turned into a city park.  That could mean that the land would becom=
e
a wildlife area again rather than a development of homes.  Ms. Benoit asked
that we contact Rhonda Cyrus at the City of League City (281-332-3431) to
tell them about the wildlife in that area.  What roosts there?  What have yo=
u
not seen since the clearing?  Can you tell us about the birds and ducks that
are there in the winter?  They will be requesting that citizens submit
information until early June.  Did you realize that Clear Creek is on the to=
p
ten list of endangered rivers in the US?  Do you have any comments or
concerns?  Let you CCV Board members know.  Be aware that this is an issue
that we need to consider carefully.

Remember, there is a CCISD meeting Tuesday night to consider your homestead
exemption.  CCV will have a group there to ask questions and give opinions.

There is a meeting on May 4 to consider the Corps of Engineers flood plans
for Clear Creek.  I will send you more on that later.

The ballots were counted and JoAnn Carter and Craig Weisiger were elected to
fill the unfilled Board positions.  Congratulations.  Thanks to all of you
who voted.

Mary G. Strickland
