Lynn,
Remedy has been updated to give home office workers a high priority and to b=
e assigned to Glenn or Robert when possible.

Glenn did install a modem in Shirley's machine.

There is still some issue with the CITRIX Server and VPN access, the solutio=
n center believes the problem is on the Road Runner side and Jean McFarland =
is working on it. Everyone is working from home with little to no problems d=
espite the CITRIX issue.=20
