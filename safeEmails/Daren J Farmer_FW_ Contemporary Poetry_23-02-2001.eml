Guys,=20
Just thought you might find this interesting.? I was forwarded this=20
poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az.=20
Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly=20
amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB=20

Now I sit me down in school=20
Where praying is against the rule=20
For this great nation under God=20
Finds mention of Him very odd.=20

If Scripture now the class recites,=20
It violates the Bill of Rights.=20
And anytime my head I bow=20
Becomes a Federal matter now.=20

Our hair can be purple, orange or green,=20
That's no offense, it's a freedom scene.=20
The law is specific, the law is precise.=20
Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.=20

For praying in a public hall=20
Might offend someone with no faith at all.=20
In silence alone we must meditate,=20
God's name is prohibited by the state.=20

We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,=20
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks.=20
They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible.=20
To quote the Good Book makes me liable.=20

We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen,=20
And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.=20
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong,=20
We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong.=20

We can get our condoms and birth controls,=20
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles.=20
But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,=20
No word of God must reach this crowd.=20

It's scary here I must confess,=20
When chaos reigns the school's a mess.=20
So, Lord, this silent plea I make,=20
Should I be shot; My soul please take!=20
