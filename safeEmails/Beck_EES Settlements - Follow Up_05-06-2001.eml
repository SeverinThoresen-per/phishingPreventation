As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn R=
uffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discus=
sed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS wou=
ld assume internal management of the settlements function, including managin=
g data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would reta=
in the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plu=
s serving as the interface with EES customers. =20

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendat=
ions from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of ro=
les and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function bef=
ore the end of this week. =20

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --S=
ally   (x35926)  =20
