I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the=
 night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don=
't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, ther=
e is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about t=
he CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a =
CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).

We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc.=
, it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early Decemb=
er.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans. =
 If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we ca=
n talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It =
is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many =
of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec,=
 then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm reall=
y just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by th=
e minute.

Of course, that will be OK.  I'll need to find another helper so we have 3. =
 Will Kim be there?  If not, maybe I can enlist my husband.=20
Will you be at 8:30 service?  If so I can get the CD from you then.  I reall=
y need to buy a CD player - maybe I can do that by Saturday so we don't have=
 to pass yours back and forth.  I'll let you know if I'm successful.=20
Thanks for the attendance numbers - I'll call Jackie tomorrow.=20
