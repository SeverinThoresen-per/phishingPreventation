Bob is a good, solid player.  He won't change the world, but he is diligent=20
about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am=20
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His=20
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we=20
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order=20
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able=20
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a=20
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitmen=
t=20
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and=20
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will=20
personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he=20
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same. =20

Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what=20
impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be=20
better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL=20
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that=20
they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with=20
Brent.  --Sally=20

What do you think of him?

Danny suggested him. I here he has some 'issues'.

I'm neither plus or negative - just fact finding.
