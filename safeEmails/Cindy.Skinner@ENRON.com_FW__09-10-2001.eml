Cindy:

Here's some basic data on this ee:

Date of Hire: 		12/18/2000
Supervisor:		James Scribner
Bus. Unit:		ENW - Energy Operations
Mid Yr. 01 Rating:	5
Comments:		Scribner became supervisor when Tammie's previous supervisor left=
 Enron (approx. mid yr.).  Short tenure with Enron may be part of the reason=
 why 			her relative ranking was a 5. (HR rep is researching and will confir=
m)

HR Rep has met with supervisor and assured me perf. review will be done this=
 week.  The HR rep also spoke with Tammie.  We are addressing Tammie's quest=
ion in the last sentence below.  As a result of her MY01 rating, she would n=
ormally get a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in addition to her performa=
nce review.  Due to the review being so overdue, my recommendation would be =
to drop the PIP and only do the review as it is unreasonable to expect Tammi=
e could accomplish the milestones in her PIP by the time her group does thei=
r PRC meeting (M. Cash to provide legal opinion on this issue).   I have adv=
ised the HR Rep and supervisor to further explain to Tammie the relative ran=
king process and the role it plays in Enron's culture and ongoing performanc=
e management process. =20

I'll forward additional information as I receive it.
