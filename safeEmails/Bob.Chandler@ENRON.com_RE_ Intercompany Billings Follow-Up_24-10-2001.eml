I haven't heard from Tracy on this.  However, I prefer the option of having =
epsc charges go to a cost center OR FAR order, depending on how the cost cen=
ter owner manages assessments.  A meeting would probably be a good opportuni=
ty to work through these issues. I'm not sure that everyone (including me) u=
nderstands all the implications.

Corporate Charges
	Tracy Geaccone has suggested (and discussed with Terry West in Corporate Pl=
anning) that the pipelines be allowed access to the 2002 Plan once it has be=
en loaded in SAP for the Corporate cost centers that bill us. The Plan would=
 be recorded by GL account within each of the applicable cost centers.  Corp=
orate prepares a schedule that shows which cost centers bill us, the methodo=
logies used and the amounts billed.  It would be quite an undertaking becaus=
e of the number of Corporate cost centers involved, but each of the pipeline=
s would be able to derive a FERC breakdown using the Plan, plus the schedule=
 from Corporate.  The main issue would be manpower.  Tracy mentioned the pos=
sibility of having one of the associate analysts perform this task, but said=
 that the Plan would not be finalized and loaded until probably the end of N=
ovember.

	Is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this furth=
er?  I am still waiting for return phone calls from Enron Networks and Globa=
l Finance.  There are just a few Global Finance cost centers that bill us.  =
However, the method proposed above may also be a solution for Enron Networks=
 billings.


Enron Property and Services Corp.
	The mandate that these billings be recorded in individual cost centers rath=
er than at a company level originated with Tracy Geaccone with a promise of =
cost savings to Stan.  However, Tracy told me that rather than coding to a c=
ost center, she has requested that the coding be to a FAR order.  I told her=
 that would mean multiple FAR orders.  Her thinking is that each cost center=
 already has a FAR order.  I attempted to describe our use of custom variant=
s.  She said that she would work through Bob Chandler.  If we intend to cont=
inue using the custom variants, it would mean creating a large number of new=
 FAR orders.

	Again, is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss thi=
s further?
