Richard,

I have found the correct path of the data files requested=20
\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\electric\west\incremnt\2000. The requested=20
directory has numerous files, not just the real-time spreadsheets. The below=
=20
attachment contains the file names of the files within the above directory=20
(do not be confused by the \\enehou rather than the \\nahoutrd, they are the=
=20
same).=20


Are you authorizing the copy of all of these files? Please advise...

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

Richard,
 Here are the specifics of what we need to get copied:

We need all files copied from this directory.  These are the 2000 West Desk

Thanks
Gary
