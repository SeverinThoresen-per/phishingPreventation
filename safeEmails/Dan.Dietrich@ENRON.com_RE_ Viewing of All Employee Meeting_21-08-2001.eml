Subject:	Viewing of All Employee Meeting

All,


The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success des=
pite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your loc=
al IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked to=
gether to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performa=
nce of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading bu=
siness was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well=
 as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed fro=
m the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium =
has been in the development stages with the production target of October 200=
1 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructu=
re and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today=
). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the tro=
ubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and Ge=
orge Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor perf=
ormance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hard=
y and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolvi=
ng the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wi=
sh to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to v=
iew this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.


Regards,

Dan Dietrich
