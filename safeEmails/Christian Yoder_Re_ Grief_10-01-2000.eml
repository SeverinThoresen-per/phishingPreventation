The serious reading community has lost a great hero.  The mysteriously=20
beautiful thing about great art, including its written form, is that it live=
s=20
on, long after the author is gone.  O'Brien has acheived immortality.  His=20
writing will always be savored by a small group who are made more alive by=20
living through his prose.   I do wish somebody would come out with a=20
biography on the man.  Maybe in a few years a scholar will roll up his=20
sleeves and get behind the veil. Now I will really slow down as I read that=20
final book, the one about the Blue Mizzen mast.   ---cgy=20
