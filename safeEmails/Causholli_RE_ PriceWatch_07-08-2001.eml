raders don't seem to use it either.=20

Paperloop has given us an estimate for the cost of giving us online access t=
o their complete historical pricing database on an going basis. Essentially =
this would cover all products that are contained in any of the price tables =
in Pulp & Paper Week.=20

Their quote is expensive so we need to think about it. We already have a fai=
r amount of historical information, although many of their prices go back (m=
onthly) to 1979 or 1980. And, of course, their data base includes some produ=
cts we don't presently track. My question to you: Would this access make a s=
ignificant difference to you in doing price analysis?

Avril: an alternate and very labor-intensive approach: I have almost all of =
the Pulp & Paper Weeks going back to 1979; we could ask a temp to key the da=
ta in out of the newsletters.=20
