If the central books have 2 set up then I'll leave MC assigned to GD and we =
need another set of central books set up for P/B/I.  Please have the new boo=
ks set up in Global first (with new book codes, not MC) then email me the ne=
w IDs, book names, book codes and region codes.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that =
the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I b=
elieve I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT=
-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian=
 book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (oth=
erwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last=
 time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot o=
f FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup. =
=20

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 1=
66859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasda=
ily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another b=
ook code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the orig=
inal list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to b=
e set up in Tagg/Erms.

Thanks,
Cecilia
