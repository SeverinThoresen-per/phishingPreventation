After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the fo=
llowing conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They d=
on't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought i=
s that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactl=
y the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburge=
r" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we=
 proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick
