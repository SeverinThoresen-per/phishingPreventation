Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business pla=
n that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is=
 probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  T=
he plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and =
until we know VAR, capital, etc.
