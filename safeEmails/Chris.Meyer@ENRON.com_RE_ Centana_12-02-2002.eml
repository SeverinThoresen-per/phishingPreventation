Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana d=
eal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the =
exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post peti=
tion storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch =
Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the d=
eal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Hav=
e you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discus=
s with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per =
Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a=
 termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost=
 on pre-petition retainage? =20
