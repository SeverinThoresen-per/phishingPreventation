Hi Harry,
=20
Just wanted to say hi.  I saw Miguel Vasquez lately and I heard from him tha=
t you moved back to trading.  Since I left Enron, I've done Telecom banking =
for a year in Asia with Lehman.   In that group, I've done a lot of valuatio=
n and financial analyses.   Deal flow suffered in the telecom industry with =
the downturn in market conditions.  On my second year at Lehman, I seized th=
e opportunity to do coverage banking, i.e. winning clients in the Philippine=
s and Taiwan.  With this step, I was fortunate to lead an M&A deal in the co=
nsumer goods sector.  It also gave me exposure in energy and financial insti=
tutions.   Thanks to my Enron background, I actually showed my value added t=
o Lehman in energy.

It pays to be a generalist in times like this.  The layoffs in banking has b=
een severe.   I have survived so far a big reduction among people of my leve=
l.  Good thing I still got a raise this year as many did not.  I don't know =
about the long term prospects of investment banking but I am thankful that I=
 have a job.  Recently I caught up with my b-school friends in San Francisco=
 and found out that it is equally bad there. Coincidentally, I caught up wit=
h a friend of mine who interviewed with Madhur Dayal who know works with Tho=
mas Weisel in San Francisco.
=20
My wife, Loreli, was able to find a job at the South China Morning Post last=
 July.  So far, we are both enjoying Hong Kong.  Long term though, I believe=
 the U.S. makes sense for both of us. =20
=20
Hope everything is going well with you.  Please let me know if you just happ=
en to be in Hong Kong.
=20
Best regards,
=20
Roy
