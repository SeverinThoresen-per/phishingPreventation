I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturity d=
ate of 2020. =20

Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective =
yield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?

Phillip,

Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan
31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worry
about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value of
your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottom
line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep in
mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close that
position you will probably get put those.

Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, if
there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such
as duration, maturity, etc.

Steve
