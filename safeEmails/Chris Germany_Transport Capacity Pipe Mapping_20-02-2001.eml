A friendly reminder.

You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity=20
tickets would have to be set up on which business units

Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport=20
capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term,
could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly=20
basis?   =20

Russ.
