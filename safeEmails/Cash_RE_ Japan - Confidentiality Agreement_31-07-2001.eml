Kriste/Michelle,
We are in the process of integrating 7 Enron Metals Far East Ltd employees f=
rom their former payroll to the Enron Japan payroll.  As part of this proces=
s, we are requiring them to sign the attached standard Confidentiality Agree=
ment.  I'm getting a lot of pushback re: non-solicitation, and the fact that=
 it governs all terminations (including involuntary).  Is there any possibil=
ity of amending?  Jane McBride and I have reviewed, and while we haven't yet=
 sought advice on the matter, feel it would likely not be enforceable in Jap=
an in case of involuntary termination without cause. =20
Are we able to make the proposed change (redlined in purple in the attachmen=
t - I guess a lot of changes have been made to this document before either J=
ane or I were involved)?  As well, would it be an issue to insert something =
about jurisdiction?
If you could let me know as soon as possible, it would be most helpful.
Thanks,
Caroline
