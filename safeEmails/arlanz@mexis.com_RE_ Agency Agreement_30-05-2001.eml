Subject: Agency Agreement

Per Barry's request, attached is the Agency and  Management Services
Agreement to be executed between Enron North America  Corp. and Mexicana De
Cobre.? Also attached is the form of agency  agreement to be attached as
Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services  Agreement.? This agency
agreement is El Paso's form and must be  executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El
Paso.? The El Paso form requires  that you open as a read only file.
Please review.

(See attached  file: Agency & Management Agreement2.doc)(See attached file:
EPNG  Agency Agr.doc)

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should  forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you  emailed.? I had a Spanish
speaking attorney in our office assist me  with their review.? The bylaws
look fine. We would like you to follow  up with a certified copy in the
mail.?? For now can you confirm  via a response to this email, that these
are the latest bylaws on  file?

?He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be  required that two
of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of  attorney documentation,
execute our agreements.? Can you  confirm?? Would be happy to discuss this
with you.

Thank you  for your cooperation.
