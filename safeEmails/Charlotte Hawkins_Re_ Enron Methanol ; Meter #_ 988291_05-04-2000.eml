Robert:

I have updated the info at Enron Methanol per gas control's volumes (via=20
meter overrides).  I did not realize that's what you wanted when you handed=20
me the "sticky" on Monday.....  I thought you were just being informative.

Sorry about the confusion.

 This is a follow up to the note I gave you on Monday, 4/3/00 { preliminary =
=20
flow data provided by Daren}.

 Please override POP'S  daily volume{ presently zero}  to reflect  daily=20
activity you can obtain from Gas Control.

 This change is needed  ASAP for economics purposes.
