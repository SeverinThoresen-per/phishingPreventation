Hi Rob,
=20
I hope all is well with you and also that Enron is making full use of your e=
xperience and talent during this very difficult time.
=20
I've been trying to get in touch with you by phone and as I realize you must=
 be in all day meetings I thought I'd switch to email. In your message last =
time you asked me to get in touch with you this last Wednesday when you woul=
d have the outcome of Joe Dilg's review of the ECI contract and my employmen=
t contract (at least that's what I thought I understood but the message was =
breaking down).
=20
As I have been postponing a deal I need to close for as long as I possibly c=
an I really would appreciate it if you could provide me with the name of som=
eone at Enron, in case you are swamped with other issues, with the authority=
 to make the payments. As I mentioned before, the payments were due a few mo=
nths ago and I'm now in real danger of not being able to close the deal at a=
ll if the payment is delayed further.
=20
ESA is telling me I need to talk to Houston but I did not want to call Ken L=
ay's office at a time like this.
=20
Please send me an email and also if you get some time please drop me a line =
to catch up on the personal side. I've been busy setting up my business in L=
ondon and I think I should be ready to go with a couple of new ventures by t=
he end of November.=20
=20
Best regards,
=20
Diomedes.
