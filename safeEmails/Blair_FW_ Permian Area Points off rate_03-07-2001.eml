Keith here are some of the points I observed that were off rate for July 1st=
=2E gas day.

Mitchell had a 46.5 schedule to us but average 19.8 due to not noticing that=
 they had a schedule to us until 5:00 PM.  that after noon. As you know one =
of your responsibilities is to monitor ALL  points and make calls to station=
s that are not on rate and notify scheduling so they can make their calls. C=
unningham was on Peak Alert all weekend and we were calling for MAX Injectio=
n, Redfield was suppose to be on 50,000 inj. for the weekend but was brought=
 up to 200,000 inj. due to too much gas on the system.  My observation is th=
at if calls would have been made on these points that are long to us it woul=
d have helped our situation. I would suggest that you pay close attention al=
l orders for every cycle so that you do not miss a change and to continually=
 review flows vs. orders through out the day.
