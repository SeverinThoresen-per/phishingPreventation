Let me clear up this process.

Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements whic=
h had been
pre-approved by legal.

If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal wil=
l have to sign-off.

If this is unacceptable, please let me know.

We were only trying to help speed up the process.

Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were n=
o deviations
from the model agreement.

Hope this helps.

bob

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading =
partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been t=
he practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreement=
s and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne C=
alcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from le=
gal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awai=
ts bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask t=
hat you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come thr=
ough our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a diff=
erent procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to co=
ntact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!
