Dave,

I am meeting with Maria Teresa this Wednesday to start working on price fore=
cast.

I am currently working with Andrew on inventory forecast and the procedure i=
s as follows:

Based on the formula (capacity * op. rate) - shipments =3D forecast inventor=
y.

We used PPPC capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the mon=
thly forecast. Then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rat=
e which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last=
 month carried forward, or the last month's operating rate difference with t=
he average and apply that difference to calculate the next  month op. rate.=20

We also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the =
month we are trying to forecast.

So far we have only tested September and the forecast was pretty close to th=
e actual.


let me know if this is what you requested,
Thanks,
Monika

Two things:

1) I think you are all aware that we need to develop a market overview prese=
ntation on each of your markets similar to what Monika is pulling together o=
n pulp. Have you started outlining what would go in your presentation?

2) Please give me a short (2-3 bullet) summary of what you are doing on pric=
ing and inventory forecasting. I want to develop a summary report for Bob Cr=
ane.

Thanks,

Dave
