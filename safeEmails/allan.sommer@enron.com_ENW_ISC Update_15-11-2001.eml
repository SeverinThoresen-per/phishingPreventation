Team -

I wanted to give you a brief update on some of the transition discussions th=
at have been occurring over the last few days.  The ISC's Steering Committee=
 is participating in a series of working sessions with Enron Networks (ENW) =
related to our current service offerings and critical business processes.  T=
hese discussions are designed to assist ENW in understanding the complexitie=
s of the many systems and processes supported by the ISC and not as some of =
you may have heard focusing on reducing headcount in the ISC.  I can tell yo=
u that our discussions with ENW have been very positive.  We are being recog=
nized for the significant contributions that we make to support Enron's core=
 businesses and have been identified as a critical group.

I understand that this is a very difficult time for everyone.  I would like =
to encourage each of you to talk with either myself or your Steering Committ=
ee member if you have specific questions or concerns.  Furthermore, I will b=
e arranging weekly ISC All Employee Meetings starting immeadiately after Tha=
nksgiving to address many of your questions and to share feedback and update=
s.

Thank you for all of your continued hard work....
