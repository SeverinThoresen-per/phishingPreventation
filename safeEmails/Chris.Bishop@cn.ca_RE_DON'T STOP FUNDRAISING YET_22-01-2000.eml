Its really hard to tell how well we are doing with fundraising so far this
 year.  Kelly Trout tells me there is about $90,000.00 in the bank.  In
 addition, she has been told of a $10,000.00 donation and that other compani=
es
 will be donating, although the exact amount is uncertain.  From my phone
 calls, it looks like there may be $20,000.00 -$40,000.00 out there that has
 not been received by Kelly.  I really hope that I am not being overly
 optimistic though.

Last year, I think we had about $140,000.00 in the bank on the night of the
 party and thought that we would raise a total of $150,000.  Somehow, after=20
all
 of the donations came in, we received $165,000.00 in donations.   So, it ma=
y
 be that if I am estimating things correctly, we are on track.

If I am being overly optimistic, however, we have a lot of work to do.  Plea=
se
 ensure that you follow-up on letters and make some last minute cold calls.
 Its not too late.

I'm attaching a list of donors from the last 2 years.   The lists show names=
=20
of
 donors who we have not yet received donations from this year, at least not =
to
 my knowledge.  Beside the donors are the names of the deputies who obtained
 the donations.  If your name is beside a company, please call the company t=
o
 find out if they will match last year's donation (or exceed it), you may be
 surprised, they may have budgeted for this donation!  Also, even if your na=
me
 is not beside a company, call these companies if you know people there.  Th=
e
 more phone calls, the more likely it is that we receive a donation!

Please keep up the hard work.  We want to meet our target!!!!

Also, email Kelly Trout at Kelly_Trout@Scotia-Mcleod.com any names of donors
 who have confirmed that they will donate, plus the anticipated amount of th=
e
 donation.  We want to be able to know by Monday how close we are to our=20
target
 -- so your communication with Kelly if important.

Thanks to everybody who is working so hard, but keep pushing yourself to get
 those extra donations.

Liz

PS  I just rented my costume on Thursday!!!  It got me pretty hyped about th=
e
 party as I stood there trying on dresses and mile high white wigs!!!
