Hello claire- I have spoken to EML's documentation department who confirmed=20
that the Kaiser  entity used for  financial trades is  Kaiser Aluminium &=20
Chemical Corporation. I can also confirm that there is an  ISDA Master in=20
place  between Kaiser and ENA, effective August 28 1997, but there is no ISD=
A=20
Master (signed or in negotiation) with Enron Metals Limited, the financial=20
trading arm of Enron Metals. EML trades have been running from 9 Jan 2001 to=
=20
4 May2001.

Hope this helps

Matt Dawson
