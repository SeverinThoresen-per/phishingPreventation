Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,=20

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest=20

"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.=20

the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20

The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the=

to a few generators.=20

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator=

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy=20
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation=
=2E=20
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information=
=20
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But=20
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without=
=20
Duke's consent.
The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in=
=20
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughou=
t=20
the state.=20
Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts t=
o=20
enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information=20
cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.=20
Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that=
=20
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=20
which stay secret.=20
"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wha=
t=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.=20
Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers=20
Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informatio=
n=20
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."=20
Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month=
=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wha=
t=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.=20
But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.=20
Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.=20
But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data=
,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.=20
"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.=20
To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.=20
Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.=20
Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records th=
e=20
committee plans to turn over.=20
"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we are=
=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=20
know what we are ultimately going to do."=20
The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, hav=
e=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=20
were cited.=20
Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formall=
y=20
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the=
=20
final arbiter of such issues.=20
Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited=20
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most=20
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

Enron's Kenneth Lay on its $3 Bln Indian Power Project: Comment
2001-07-09 09:56 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- Kenneth Lay, chairman of
Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, on its $3 billion
India unit Dabhol Power Co.
     Lay met India's Power Minister Suresh Prabhu in New Delhi
today. He was accompanied by Wade Cline, managing director of
Dabhol Power.

     ``We had a productive conversation. Obviously there are
problems and differences and they need to be solved.''

     Dabhol and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, have been quarrelling for the past seven months over
unpaid bills. The board no longer buys power from the unit and
construction work on the second phase of the plant was stopped
last month after lenders stopped funding it.

     ``We are working hard and are committed to finding a solution
for investors'' in the project, India's biggest foreign direct
investment yet.
     ``It's premature to say whether we will pull out'' of the
project. ``We have been and remain committed to India.''

Barry Abramson, an analyst at UBS Warburg.=20

Enron's Kenneth Lay on India's Dabhol Power Project: Comment
2001-07-10 06:10 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 10 (Bloomberg) -- Kenneth Lay, chairman of
Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, speaks after talks
with India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha about its $3 billion
Dabhol Power Co. unit.
     Dabhol and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, have been quarrelling for the past seven months over
unpaid bills. The board no longer buys power from the unit and
construction work on the second phase of the plant was stopped
last month after lenders stopped funding it.

     ``We've had a very productive meeting with the minister of
finance. We discussed the problems with the Dabhol project (and) a
number of different avenues to try and resolve the difficulties.
     ``We didn't come to any conclusions today and didn't expect
to come to any conclusions. It will take more work from us and the
governments of Maharashtra and India. We are very hopeful that the
problems can and will be resolved fairly quickly.
     ``It's in everybody's best interest, the government of India,
the U.S., investors, the government of Japan. We have many
government financial entities involved in this project, the Export-
Import Bank of the U.S. and OPIC (Overseas Private Investment
Corporation) have about $400 million of debt involved in the
project.
     ``The Japanese export bank has about $350 million invested in
the project. The LNG (liquefied natural gas) contracts are with
the governments of Oman and Abu Dhabi. Private sector investors
include Enron, General Electric and Bechtel.
     ``So you have a lot of interest here that would like to see
this resolved fairly quickly.''
     The second phase of the project ``is about 85 percent
complete including the LNG facility. But with non-payments by the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the lenders and equity
investors were not willing to continue providing the financing for
completing the construction. Now, it's been demobilized.
     ``This will add additional cost to the project ultimately and
delay its start. We could not avoid that and very much regret it
because Dabhol, both phase one and two as well as the LNG
facility, are great for Maharashtra and for India.''




Prosecutors to Get Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Documents (Update1)
2001-07-09 19:05 (New York)

Prosecutors to Get Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Documents (Update1)

     (Adds comments from Oregon in fifth paragraph, background in
seventh paragraph, company comment in 11th paragraph.)

     Los Angeles, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- California's attorney
general can share with Oregon and Washington documents he
subpoenaed from Reliant Energy Inc., Mirant Corp. and Dynegy Inc.
in an electricity price-collusion probe, a state judge ruled.
     Los Angeles Superior Court Judge George Wu today said
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer can release the
information July 12. The generators told the court they plan an
immediate appeal and will ask a higher court to bar distribution
of the papers.
     The states, California's grid manager and Senate, and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are among the agencies
looking into whether generators illegally manipulated the Western
electricity market to charge record prices.
     California is months into an energy crisis that has brought
rolling blackouts and the bankruptcy of PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric. The documents will advance state probes; if generators
are charged and found guilty of violating state law, they may face
civil or criminal penalties.
     ``The court orders that unless a stay is granted by the Court
of Appeal, the protective order will be lifted as to the
Washington and Oregon attorneys general'' on July 12, Wu said in
an order after hearing oral arguments today.
     The three states are pursuing separate investigations and
each agreed months ago to share any information that could help
the others, said Kevin Neeley, spokesman for Oregon Attorney
General Hardy Myers.
     Oregon's investigation ``has been relatively slow going,''
Neeley said, noting that the state was having difficulty getting
documents.

                    Looking for Refunds

     Wu two weeks ago ruled that Lockyer could share documents
with other California agencies.
     The attorney general and other agencies are investigating
most major generators, such as Duke Energy Corp. and Enron Corp.
Mirant, Dynegy and Reliant were the only companies to challenge
Lockyer's right to share documents.
     Also today, two weeks of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
talks between power sellers and California on overcharges ended
without an accord. California says it is due a refund of $8.9
billion. The companies say they're still owed money for past power
deliveries.
     Houston-based Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said his company
is ``confident that if in fact the attorney general turns over the
documents, any information will be kept confidential'' as
stipulated in the subpoena order.
     Spokesmen for Houston-based Reliant and Atlanta-based Mirant
declined to comment. Reliant shares rose 9 cents to $32.49, Mirant
shares rose $1.58 to $38.35 and Dynegy shares rose 48 cents to
$46.85.
