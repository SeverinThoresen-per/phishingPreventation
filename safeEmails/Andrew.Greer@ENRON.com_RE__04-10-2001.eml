Black dot is what I would need.  The two concerns I have is shaft flex (I wo=
uld actually prefer steel shafts) and the price (I'm broke).  I appreciate y=
our willingness to work with me but even though your price is fair, I simply=
 can't afford it.  Let me know how much you would be willing to come off but=
 I have to warn you even if you ask $600 it would be hard for me to come up =
with.
Thanks again for keeping me in mind.
Drew

The Ping I-3's are black dot.  New Ping I-3's with steel shafts are $699.00 =
and used Ping I-3's are $500.00 - $550.00.  If you have any interest at all =
I would be willing to work with you on price and/or payment terms.

Thanks for the heads up.  Are they black dot?  Even if they are, I much pref=
er steel shaft's (mainly because I'm poor).  Thanks for offer and keep me in=
 the loop for other ping I-3 or Callaway X-14

Andrew,

Ping I-3 oversize, graphite shaft, reqular flex.  The regular flex in Ping g=
raphite shafts are pretty firm.  I have 3 thru pw, all in excellent conditio=
n.  If you have any interest we can talk about the price but my first inclin=
ation is that the price would be similar to the price for a new set of Ping =
I-3 oversize steel shaft (approx $700).
