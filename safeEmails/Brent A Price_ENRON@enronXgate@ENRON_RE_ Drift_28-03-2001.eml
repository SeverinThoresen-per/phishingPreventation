Louise - Current status on Drift expense allocations....  We have reviewed t=
he $11.8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodolog=
y being used by Gary to allocate costs.  When Gary is back in the office on =
Thursday, I will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need=
 to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages.  I w=
ill let you know the outcome of that meeting.

Also, keep in mind that the $11.8 million represents a Plan amount.  Actuals=
 should be much less since we are currently well under Plan headcount amount=
s and not all Plan expenses have been made.  Let me know if you have any que=
stions - I will keep you updated.

Regards,

Brent

Mike and I have discussed the Drift plan and clearly there was an allocation=
 issue somewhere along the line.  Please let us have our new numbers.

Thanks

Louise
