Thanks, Tracy. The reclass turned out to be 43.3 mill, which is what I adjus=
ted 3rd ce for. Is this the only adjustment you want us to make? We have a c=
ouple of other large items (goodwill, FAS 133), maybe at this point we shoul=
d just include them in the current cash flow forecast. Let me know, thanks.

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect =
the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you =
sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we u=
pdate it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mi=
ll revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the Octobe=
r monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.=20
