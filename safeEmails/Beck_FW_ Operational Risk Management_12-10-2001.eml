Per my voice mail, Wanda is still the lead on this initiative.  From our con=
versation in your office, I had assumed that this would change.  Apparently =
has not to date. =20

Rick Buy and I are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour.  My inten=
t had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and t=
o suggest an approach for meeting his objectives.  He has added Wanda, Debbi=
e Brackett, Bill Bradford and David Port to the tomorrow's meeting since our=
 first point of discussion will be a joint project that Rick and I are spons=
oring.  Unless he pairs down the group in tomorrow's meeting after our first=
 topic, I doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversatio=
n in your office regarding operational risk.  --Sally =20

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operationa=
l Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the aftern=
oon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your sc=
hedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been id=
entified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will ide=
ntify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other =
individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or re=
sources or required. =20

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda =
will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

	Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
	Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the gro=
up)
	     Develop Common Language
                 Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
	     Role of this task force  - Strategy
	     Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward =
to 2002
	Current Initiatives
	Communications Plan=20
	Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group=20
			  - Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force
=09

I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique oppo=
rtunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting =
guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of =
which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But m=
ost importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operat=
ional risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior=
 to the meeting. =20

Thanks,=20
Wanda Curry
