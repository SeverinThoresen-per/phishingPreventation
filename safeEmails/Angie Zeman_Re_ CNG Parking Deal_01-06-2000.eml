These numbers will change a little but this is what we currently have in the=
=20
system.

Parking in May  55,150 dth/total (deal 281565)
Taking out in June 1,837 dth/day  (deal 281556)

I'm not sure if the May numbers are net of fuel and we don't have an exact=20
parking number for today as well.

David, where do I show the $.04 parking fee.  We are paying $.04 times the=20
total volume parked, not the daily balance.
