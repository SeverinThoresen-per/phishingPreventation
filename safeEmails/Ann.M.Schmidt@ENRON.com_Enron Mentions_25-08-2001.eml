DETAILS have been officially released on the cause of the fatal electrical e=
xplosion at the Enron power station which killed three workers.=20
Health and Safety Inspectors have completed the first stage of their investi=
gation into the explosion on August 8 at the Teesside site.
The investigation has revealed that during a planned maintenance programme, =
part of the power station was shut down and the electrical power was redistr=
ibuted to support the rest of the station.=20
The voltages in one of the electrical systems was adjusted so a circuit brea=
ker could be closed.=20
At the time of the shutdown, employees were working to alter the voltage acr=
oss a large transformer and the two operations at the same time resulted in =
an explosion and fire. The plant was shut down and did not resume producing =
electricity until Sunday, August 19.=20
The next stage of the investigation will consider whether any lessons can be=
 learnt from the accident to prevent it happening again.=20
One man is still in hospital with serious burns following the explosion.

More than a week after announcing his startling resignation from energy gian=
t Enron Corp. for undisclosed personal reasons, former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilli=
ng, 47, says he has no regrets about leaving after only six months at the he=
lm. Replacing him in the interim is Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who previous=
ly served as CEO for 15 years before Skilling stepped in. (See BW Online, 8/=
24/01, "Enron's Ken Lay: "There's No Other Shoe to Fall")=20
So why did he quit? Skilling still isn't saying. A divorced father of three =
who's now engaged to be married anew, Skilling, like Lay, insists Enron is i=
n great shape, with a deep bench of talent, despite a 50% drop in the compan=
y's stock this year. Indeed, Skilling is brimming with plans for his future.=
 Before leaving for a whitewater rafting trip in Idaho with his 11-year-old =
son, he chatted on Aug. 23 with Dallas Bureau Chief Wendy Zellner. Here are =
edited excerpts from their conversation:=20
Q: I have to start with the obvious question: Why are you leaving so abruptl=
y?=20
A. The answer we gave is exactly right. I left for personal reasons. Yeah, o=
f course lots of things go on when you're making that decision. Sure, you wa=
tch the stock price and all the rest of that. But that wasn't the reason. Th=
e reason was, it was time.... I've worked very, very hard for a very long ti=
me. When you do that, something has to give. You kind of lead an unbalanced =
life and, at some point, you just decide, "Hey, there's a lot more to life t=
han just working."=20
Q: Why didn't you decide that before you became CEO [in February of this yea=
r]?=20
A: That's another thing that bugs me a little bit. I came to Enron from McKi=
nsey & Co. in 1990. I came over as chairman and chief executive officer of E=
nron Finance Corp. and went on to build our nonregulated merchant business. =
For most of my career at Enron, I was chairman and CEO of Enron Capital & Tr=
ade, and today it's 80% to 90% of net income of the company.... When people =
say this is surprising when you just became CEO, I've been CEO of businesses=
 within Enron for a long, long time. I'm not sure I ever aspired to being CE=
O. I aspired to building a business. We built a heck of a business, and I'm =
very proud of that. Some people would even argue that it changed an industry=
=2E=20
Q: You were quoted as saying that if the stock had been going in the other d=
irection, you might not have felt the pressure to leave. Is that right?=20
A: There are some things I need to do in my personal life, and I need to do =
them now. I don't think that [the stock going up] would have made a differen=
ce.=20
Q: Is it some kind of family crisis? Is it about you personally or about oth=
er members of your family?=20
A: I can't deal with that. I really can't explain it.... I'm looking forward=
 now. I'm looking for things that I want to do, and there are a lot of thing=
s I'm very interested in right now.=20
Q: What do you do next?=20
A: I'll give you just a list of things. First, there are a number of persona=
l and family things that are very important to me, and that's going to take =
a big chunk of my time.=20
Another one that I think is important is the whole city of Houston and what =
has happened. The last couple of years, everyone has been blinded by Silicon=
 Valley. I don't think they've realized...there are some very fundamental po=
werful things happening here.... We have fundamentally adopted and taken adv=
antage of the power of the Internet, the power of computers in ways I don' t=
 think any other industry and any other part of the country has really figur=
ed out. There are things I think I can do to be of assistance there.... Ther=
e are some models there that other people ought to be looking at.=20
I firmly believe that the model that Enron has created, this model where, ov=
er time, you use markets rather than vertical integration to tie together or=
ganizations and build services and products for customers, that's the future=
 of business. It's happening more and more, but it has been masked by all th=
is noise that has surrounded the dot-coms.=20
Q: Are you talking about consulting? Or would you invest in some kind of tec=
hnology-related business?=20
A: I'm not sure yet. A number of people have sought me out for points of vie=
w, and I will continue to do that. I've even, believe it or not, been contac=
ted about potentially being dean of a business school.=20
Q: Which one?=20
A: I can't say. I'm not leaving Houston, Texas. This is the place to be righ=
t now. The other thing I want to do is...spend some time on what I call hand=
s-on charity.... There's a certain therapeutic value in going out and buildi=
ng a house for someone or cleaning up a park.... The other thing I'm hoping =
I have an opportunity to do is to help articulate the value of markets. When=
 you look at something like the whole California thing, the problems in Cali=
fornia were not a failure of the market -- they were a failure of political =
leadership.=20
Q: You've said that you took the falling stock price personally. In hindsigh=
t, what do you think you did wrong or could have done differently?=20
A: Anybody that had a high [price-to-earnings] multiple has been hammered. I=
 think part of that was legitimate because...people had probably an unrealis=
tic expectation of the effect technology would have on economic growth and p=
roductivity.... I put Enron in the same class as a lot of companies that are=
 excellent companies that had very high p-e's, and that was adjusted by the =
market.=20
Q: What will it take for Enron's stock to bounce back?=20
A: You've got to get the stock price back the old-fashioned way. You've got =
to earn more money. If, quarter-in, quarter-out, the company continues to pe=
rform as it has, at some point, unless p-e multiples go negative, the stock =
goes up a lot.=20
Q: Why didn't you wait a few more months to meet the timetable for having a =
$2 million company loan forgiven, at least?=20
A: I'm lucky. I've done very well.... It has given me a luxury that 99.9% of=
 the population doesn't have. I can do what I need to on the personal side. =
Two million in the grand scheme of things compared to living your life...I'm=
 almost 48 years old. I started working full time when I was 14.... Now it's=
 time to focus on things that put a little more balance in my life.=20
Q: You've said Enron is in great shape and has surmounted most of its issues=
=2E Do you really believe that?=20
A: I absolutely believe that.... The whole California thing [where Enron and=
 others have been investigated amid allegations of manipulating markets afte=
r power prices soared last year] is pretty much done. In India [where Enron =
is in a payment dispute with the government over its $3 billion power plant =
there], I think we're making good progress.... I will say that broadband [En=
ron's new business for trading high-speed communications capacity] did surpr=
ise me.... It turned from a glut [in the industry] to a meltdown.=20
As late as four or five months ago, it seemed that everything was on plan. I=
t was evolving the way we expected it to evolve. And then the bottom just fe=
ll out. Suddenly, it was pretty hard to do business because anyone you did b=
usiness with you didn't know if they could perform on their contracts. Huge =
credit problems. That was a frustrating experience to have called it right a=
nd still not have been able to create the kind of business that I know we wi=
ll ultimately create there.... I think it set us back at least a couple of y=
ears.=20
Q: What about reports that there was some unhappiness on your part about Cha=
irman Ken Lay being too involved in the business again?=20
A: I can absolutely, unequivocally say that is not the case. Ken Lay is a go=
od friend. We've worked together closely for 16 years. Ken and I have always=
 gotten along great.=20
Q: When we talked as you were becoming CEO, I asked you what setbacks or fai=
lures you'd ever had in your life. You said none. Do you consider this to be=
 your first failure?=20
A: Maybe this will sound awful, but I don't. I remember when there were thre=
e of us on the 39th floor at Enron, when we got this whole nonregulated side=
 of the business going. Like I said, I am very proud of what I and others ac=
complished at Enron. We built a company that, 10 years from now, 20 years fr=
om now, is going to be a factor to be reckoned with. I can probably say I ha=
ve no regrets.=20
Q: Were you surprised that your leaving drove the stock price down some more=
?=20
A: Yes, because I firmly believed that everything was in good shape. I said =
to Ken, this is the time to do it if I'm going to do it because everything i=
s in good shape.... Probably people are afraid there's another shoe to drop,=
 but it's just not the case.=20
Q: Do you ever want to be CEO of a company again some day?=20
A: I won't say never. There are a couple of things I have got to get done ov=
er the next year or two. At the end of a year or two, I don't know. I'll kin=
d of take it as it comes. I tend to be a very enthusiastic, optimistic kind =
of person. I've almost never gone more than 30 days without having some sort=
 of earth-shattering idea, most of them probably pretty crazy. But over the =
next couple of years, while I'm doing what I need to do, I'll probably come =
up with some new ideas.... You probably haven't seen the last of me.

Enron's Ken Lay: "There's No Other Shoe to Fall"; As the energy giant's stoc=
k tumbles after Jeffrey Skilling's sudden resignation, the interim CEO tries=
 to reassure investors

08/24/2001
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Enron Corp.'s Jeffrey K. Skilling dropped a bombshell on Aug. 14, when he ab=
ruptly resigned as the company's president and CEO, citing "entirely persona=
l reasons (see BW Online, 8/15/01, "Jeffrey Skilling's Surprising Split from=
 Enron"). Skilling has since allowed that the precipitous 50% drop in the Ho=
uston-based energy giant's stock this year had something to do with his deci=
sion. Meanwhile, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 14%, to around $36, =
following Skilling's resignation (for a Q&A with the former CEO, see "We Bui=
lt a Heck of a Business").=20
Enron immediately named its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, as Skilling's interim =
replacement. Lay is no stranger to the job, having served as CEO from 1985 u=
ntil Skilling became CEO in January. During Lay's 15 years at the helm, he t=
ransformed Enron from a regional natural-gas pipeline company into the world=
's largest energy-trading company -- guided in part by Skilling, who he was =
grooming as a successor.=20
Enron's market capitalization under Lay increased from $2 billion to $70 bil=
lion, and Enron's shareholders received a total return three times that of t=
he S&P 500. The company, which had revenues of $101 billion in 2000, markets=
 electricity and natural gas, delivers physical commodities, and provides fi=
nancial and risk-management services to customers around the world. It has a=
lso developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business.=
=20
In an exclusive interview on Aug. 20 with BusinessWeek Dallas Correspondent =
Stephanie Anderson Forest, Lay discussed Skilling's resignation, the search =
for a permanent successor, and the future of Enron. Here are edited excerpts=
 from their conversation:=20
Q: Since his official resignation announcement Aug. 14, Mr. Skilling has sin=
ce added that one of those personal reasons included Enron's falling stock p=
rice on his watch. A declining stock price doesn't seem like a very personal=
 reason.=20
A: I believe the stock price played a role in his decision. He was probably =
feeling quite a bit of pressure from the stock price decline, from Californi=
a [where state regulators are asking Enron and other power companies to refu=
nd billions in alleged energy overcharges], from India [Enron is involved in=
 a high-profile, costly fight with the Indian government over its $3 billion=
 Dabhol power plant], and other issues. I think all of those kinds of things=
 impacted his decision.=20
Q: There has been some concern among investors that perhaps there is more to=
 his resignation than meets the eye, perhaps accounting or other issues that=
 have yet to come to light. Is there anything more?=20
A: There are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with Jeff's depa=
rture. There are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues,=
 no previously unknown problem issues. The company is probably in the strong=
est and best shape that it has ever been in.=20
There are no surprises. We did file our 10-Q [with the Securities & Exchange=
 Commission] a few days ago [Aug. 14]. And, if there were any serious proble=
ms, they would be in there. If there's anything material and we're not repor=
ting it, we'd be breaking the law. We don't break the law.=20
Q: Did he disclose these personal reasons to you?=20
A: Yes...and they are very legitimate, personal reasons that Jeff will have =
to disclose when and if he sees fit. He says he wants to keep those reasons =
private and I respect that. I can say, these are situations that needed to b=
e addressed now. These are things that he can't put off dealing with for two=
 to three years.=20
Q: Are these personal issues related to his health?=20
A: No.=20
Q: When did he tell you he wanted to resign and what was your reaction?=20
A: I don't recall the exact date. It was a few days before the board meeting=
=2E I called several of the board members before the meeting to let them kno=
w what was going on. I do remember I was in my office when he told me. I had=
 been out of town on a business trip and had just gotten back the night befo=
re. The next morning he came over to my office and said he had a few things =
on his mind. We went over several business items for about 20 to 30 minutes.=
 Then he said, "I've decided I need to step down as president and CEO and le=
ave the company."=20
I said, "You're going to do what?" I was very surprised. I asked him if ther=
e was anything I or the board had or had not done that led him to this decis=
ion. He said no. I then asked him if there was anything I or the board could=
 do to persuade him to stay. He said his mind was made up. That was on a Fri=
day.=20
The following Monday, we talked again. I asked him if he had changed his min=
d. He said no. Over the next few days, I tried three or four times to talk h=
im out of it, but he had his mind made up. He needed to deal with these [per=
sonal] issues right away, not two or three years from now.=20
Q: These issues couldn't have waited a few months? I ask because according t=
o the [2000] proxy, had Mr. Skilling stayed on through the end of the year, =
his $2 million debt to the company would have been forgiven. [According to t=
he proxy, in 1997 Enron loaned $4 million to Skilling, who repaid $2 million=
 of that in 1999. His employment contract, which ran through the end of 2003=
, called for the balance of the loan to be forgiven if he stayed on until De=
cember 31, 2001.]=20
A: Jeff knew full well what he was walking away from. Again, he needed to de=
al with this right away. [Note: Skilling also relinquished severance pay by =
walking away voluntarily. Had he been forced out, Skilling would have been e=
ligible to receive a single severance payment of at least $19.9 million, not=
 including the value of the options received in 2000, according to Enron's 2=
000 proxy statement. Also, the nonvested portion of the 2.4 million stock op=
tions he owns immediately would have become vested, the proxy statement says=
=2E]=20
Q: Judging by the stock's performance since the announcement, investors appe=
ar to still be skeptical.=20
A: Yes, and I understand that. Investors don't like uncertainty. When there'=
s uncertainty they always think there's another shoe to fall. There is no ot=
her shoe to fall.=20
Q: Is the door open for Mr. Skilling to return to the CEO post after he has =
resolved these personal issues?=20
A: It's always a possibility. But he understands that we've got to move ahea=
d, and I assume for now we will be moving on without him. He will be dealing=
 with these other issues for at least a year or two.=20
Q: What will the new management team look like?=20
A: Clearly, there will be changes in the office of the chairman. Jeff and I =
had shared responsibility in that office since 1997 and, from time to time, =
we have had one other person in that office. I'll be looking for some help n=
ow. We will appoint one or two people to that office within the next few day=
s.=20
Q: Who are the likely candidates?=20
A: Any slots at the senior level, including CEO or other slots, will be fill=
ed internally. That tells you how confident we are in the talent we have. We=
 have a a number of senior executives qualified to serve in this capacity. W=
e have many large businesses in Enron, any one of which would be ranked rath=
er high as a standalone. Anyone of the top two people in any of these busine=
sses or our CFO, chief accounting officer or chief of staff would be qualifi=
ed. [That pool of executives include: CFO Andrew S. Fastow, Chief Accounting=
 Officer Richard A. Causey, Chief of Staff Steven J. Kean, Chairman and CEO =
of Enron Energy Services Dave Delainey, Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale =
Services Mark A. Frevert, CEO Enron Global Assets & Services Kevin P. Hannon=
, and Chairman and CEO Stanley C. Horton of Enron Transportation Services Co=
=2E].=20
Q: Despite having a deep bench of talented executives, some analysts say few=
 Enron executives are as seasoned as Skilling was. Is that a concern?=20
A: No, because the ones I'm looking at are very seasoned, though some are mo=
re seasoned than others. They are all very strong candidates who understand =
our business and our culture. In every case, [the candidates] have been here=
 several years, and, in some cases, 11 or 12 years. These are not unseasoned=
 people.=20
Q: So, whoever makes it to the office of the chairman has a shot at being En=
ron's next CEO?=20
A: Yes, but I have made it very clear that although they certainly will be o=
n the list of people to be the CEO, they're not guaranteed to be the CEO.=20
Q: What qualities will you and the board be looking for in Enron's next CEO?=
=20
A: We'll be looking for a good, strong leader, a very effective leader [who]=
 really knows our business -- all our businesses, not just what they're runn=
ing today. We're also looking for a good people person who is able to motiva=
te others and get strong performances out of people. We need someone who is =
a strong representative of our value system.=20
That someone would also be very intelligent, very creative, and able to deve=
lop successful strategies. Being a good communicator is also very important.=
 Clearly, to be a good leader you need to be a good communicator.=20
Q: How involved will you be with the company until a new CEO is found?=20
A: I've extended my contract with the company through 2005 and have reassume=
d the CEO and president positions [both previously held by Skilling]. I have=
 told the board I will stay as long as necessary to get our next level of su=
ccession ready and to get the board and investors comfortable with that pers=
on. I didn't expect to be CEO again, but I'm happy to be doing it.=20
Q: Will Mr. Skilling's departure bring a new shift or focus in Enron's busin=
ess strategy?=20
A: There won't be any refocus. [Since turning over the CEO reins in January]=
, I have stayed actively involved and working full-time as Jeff asked me to.=
 More importantly, the current direction of the company was jointly decided =
by both of us in the last several years.=20
Q: And, the fundamentals of the business strategy remain solid?=20
A: Yes. We think the company is on solid footing, and we're looking forward =
to continued strong growth. We had a very, very strong first half, including=
 second-quarter net income up 40%, earnings per share up 32%, and operationa=
l physical volume delivery up 60%. In the last five years, we have had 25% p=
er year compounded annual growth in earnings per share.=20
I think you'll continue to see strong growth in all of our business areas. O=
ur revenues and income quarter-to-quarter continues to be strong and we have=
 strong momentum. We think that will be sustained, and eventually, if we con=
tinue to do that, investors will recognize and reward us for that.

POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

08/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years wor=
king with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former chi=
ef executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.=20
The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the company=
's board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for pers=
onal reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several=
 analysts have said they're waiting for "the other shoe to drop." The compan=
y's stock price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss =
of about $4.5 billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week.
But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once invest=
ors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the compan=
y.=20
"I've spent the last 34 years working really hard," said Skilling, who reque=
sted the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "There are a lot of things that=
 I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family. There=
 are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I b=
elieve I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and doi=
ng things, building houses, helping individuals."=20
Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years,=
 said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.=20
"It's massively underrated as a place to work and live," he said. "It's a gr=
eat city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across."=20
Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal r=
easons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surren=
der the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six mo=
nths after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 19=
97 until this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's =
wholesale trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earni=
ngs.=20
He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine. Skilli=
ng, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that he wa=
s suffering under the strain of the job.=20
Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York =
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going "kind of nuts" under =
the pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.=20
"It's not true that I was cracking up," he said. "Do I sound like someone wh=
o is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable =
representation."=20
When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not =
to alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been=
 better, but said that is hindsight.=20
"We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way,"=
 he said. "I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn ou=
t, in retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else."=20

The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column=
 last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role=
 of chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the com=
pany and pushed Skilling out.=20
"I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me," he s=
aid. "I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the stor=
y. I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama=
 and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the =
deal is."=20
Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many times =
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came =
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of h=
is giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.=20
"The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14 board=
 meeting) where the decisions were going to be made," he said.=20
The decisions?=20
"I guess to accept my resignation," Skilling said.=20
Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board meeting,=
 which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release board-=
meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.=20
The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A c=
lause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through t=
he end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.=20
That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most aggress=
ive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.=20
"Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become CEO =
of Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did," =
said Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading =
powerhouse.=20
"The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on."=20
He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have expres=
sed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's prede=
cessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left the com=
pany in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief execut=
ive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small liquids=
 pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc. (KMI).=20
Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a "very deep bench." For exam=
ple, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as "awe=
some."=20
"Dave created the Canadian business in Enron," Skilling said.=20

New Ontario Power Market Date Not Firm Enough - Industry

08/24/2001

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- Power brokers called on Ontario to set a firm date for=
 its electricity market opening - and stick to it, after provincial agencies=
 pointed to a March 1, 2002, deadline this week.=20
The new timetable - the fourth adjusting of dates since 1999 - will increase=
 costs for established firms and could further erode interest of potential i=
nvestors, energy representatives said Friday.
"Our major concern is the historical pattern of delays that we've had with O=
ntario market opening," Ron Milnthorp, president of Enron Canada said.=20
"We can't invest capital on a conditional basis, and, therefore, we need an =
unconditional market opening."=20
Earlier this year, Enron Canada put a C$200-million power plant project for =
southwestern Ontario on hold after Premier Mike Harris set back an expected =
May market opening indefinitely.=20
The revamped market readiness testing schedule released by the Independent E=
lectricity Market Operator and the Ontario Energy Board Tuesday extends reta=
il and wholesale testing to December and February, and includes fines of up =
to C$10,000 a day for late completion.=20
"We are doing out best to meet what we think is a realistic deadline," IMO s=
pokesman Kevin Dove said.=20
Milnthorp said Enron Canada now is more optimistic the government will stick=
 to a spring 2002 date.=20
Technical difficulties were blamed in setting back deregulation from May to =
this November, and from fall of 2000.=20
Critics also say the California crisis, which saw electricity prices skyrock=
et in that state, caused the Ontario government to delay deregulation to pla=
cate nervous consumers. The uncertainty has cost an estimated C$3 billion fr=
om proposed power plants being put on hold,=20
"Any further delay will have severe implications on investor confidence in t=
he market," TransAlta (T.TA) spokesman Adam White warned from Toronto.=20
This summer TransAlta (T.TA), Canada's largest investor-owned power generato=
r, said it would defer any new investment in Ontario because of market uncer=
tainty.=20
Work on the corporation's C$400-million Sarnia cogeneration plant continued,=
 however, and it will start producing power in spring of 2002. The latest ma=
rket delay just means TransAlta won't have the benefit of watching the marke=
t and trading in it before commissioning the plant, White said.=20
Smaller retail distributors are being blamed in part for the delay because o=
f difficulties setting up new billing and accounting systems.=20
Toronto Hydro has offered to help other retailers set up their systems to ge=
t deregulation up and running.=20
"Every day we don't have market-opening date, we have money going out," spok=
esman Stephen Andrews said. "It is a significant cost in terms of opportunit=
y."=20
Final approval for market opening will have to be given by the provincial go=
vernment, which so far has refused to set a firm date.=20

Jeffrey Skilling's Surprising Split from Enron; The CEO's abrupt resignation=
 has some investors wondering what's behind the trickle of execs leaving the=
 company
By Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas

08/15/2001
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The steady drip of executive departures continues at Houston energy giant En=
ron (ENE). After the close of markets on Aug. 14, Jeffrey K. Skilling, the c=
ompany's hard-charging president and CEO, shocked the investment community b=
y unexpectedly resigning. In a conference call with investors, Skilling, sai=
d he was leaving for personal reasons, which would remain private. Prior to =
taking over the CEO post in February, Skilling had been chief operating offi=
cer. While it looks for a successor, Enron says Skilling's duties will be as=
sumed by longtime Chairman Kenneth Lay. "I want to thank Ken Lay for his und=
erstanding of this purely personal decision," Skilling said in a statement.=20
The 47-year-old Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey's energ=
y and chemical consulting practices. Under his leadership, Enron pioneered t=
he use of risk-management products and new contracting structures in the nat=
ural-gas industry. He has since applied similar concepts in electricity, ban=
dwidth, metals, and a range of other commodity products. Along with Lay, Ski=
lling helped transform Enron from a natural-gas pipeline company into an ene=
rgy-trading powerhouse.=20
Skilling has predicted that Enron will surpass $200 billion in revenue this =
year, making it the second-largest U.S. energy company behind ExxonMobil. La=
st year, Enron earned $979 million on revenue of $101 billion. While the com=
pany has 25,000 miles of gas pipeline and merchant power plants in the U.S. =
and abroad producing 9,000 megawatts of electricity, Enron recently has been=
 shedding many energy assets, including its natural-gas and crude-oil drilli=
ng unit, to pursue its goal of becoming the industry's leading middleman, br=
inging together buyers and sellers of energy products.=20
BLOCKBUSTER BUST. Skilling's tenure in the No. 2 position has been tumultuou=
s -- marred by a huge and costly fight with the Indian government over payme=
nt for construction of Enron's $3 billion Dabhol power-plant project and the=
 nasty breakup of a video-on-demand broadband Internet deal with Blockbuster=
=2E Skilling's push into broadband has produced lackluster results. The upsh=
ot: Enron's stock has fallen from a 52-week high of $90.56 on August 23, 200=
0, to $42.93 on Aug. 14, ahead of the announcement.=20
The company didn't immediately comment on what led Skilling to quit, but a s=
pokesman insists it has nothing to do with Enron's stock performance. "We re=
gret Jeff's decision to resign, as he has been a big part of our success for=
 over 11 years," Lay said in a statement. "But we have the strongest and dee=
pest talent we have ever had in the organization, our business is extremely =
strong, and our growth prospects have never been better."=20
Indeed, the company says it plans to look for Skilling's successor within th=
e ranks, though it declined to name possible candidates. But some analysts a=
nd investors say Enron may have trouble landing a replacement. "Rarely do yo=
u find those kinds of organizational and management capabilities embodied in=
 one individual," says analyst Robert L. Christensen Jr. of First Albany in =
New York. "There's no clear second in command. It's purely a guessing game a=
t the moment."=20
MURKY DEPTH CHART. Skilling's departure likely won't sit well with investors=
, who are concerned about Enron's losing a number of key executives recently=
, including Vice-Chairman J. Clifford Baxter and Kenneth D. Rice, chairman a=
nd CEO of Enron Broadband Services. "Three years ago, the [management] depth=
 chart was very apparent. The company had started to look like the General E=
lectric of the energy logistics business," says one investor. "Now, I'm not =
too sure."=20
Skilling, who wasn't immediately available for comment following the confere=
nce call, will remain as a consultant. Lay, who was also unavailable, served=
 as Enron's CEO from 1985 until Skilling's election earlier this year. He ha=
s agreed to extend his employment agreement through 2005. Said Lay during th=
e call: "I'm prepared to stay here as long as it takes to get to our next le=
vel of succession." If the skeptics are right, that could turn out to be lon=
ger than Lay expects.
