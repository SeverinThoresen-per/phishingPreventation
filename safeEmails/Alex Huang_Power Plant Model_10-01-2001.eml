Ken of RDI and I have gone through his model together and I have a clear ide=
a
of how it's going step by step. I believe we can almost start recoding now.=20

I need a C programmer who's familiar with Access data base.
I.e., he (or she) knows how to extract data from an Access data table (of
certain format) and output the results into an Access data table of certain
format.  Once the programmer is assigned, I will go through the model
with him and incorporate his ideas and Ken's, then we can start coding.

Alex
