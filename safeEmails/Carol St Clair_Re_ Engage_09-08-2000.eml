Mary,

Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we=20
have sent to Engage:

1) Engage Energy US, LP:
I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this=20
morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed. =20
According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we sen=
d=20
executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we=
=20
need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as=
=20
the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  =
I=20
am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts.

2) Engage Energy Canada, LP
According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract=20
was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be=20
sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft=20
guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterpart=
y=20
is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be=20
updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit informatio=
n=20
is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty=
=20
to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Thank you,

Russell

I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open=20

which he never responded to.

Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. =20
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded=

Hi Carol,=20

Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you=
=20
are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further=20
information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on=20
this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to=20
cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they=20
issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like t=
o=20
know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA=20
amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up.

Hope all is well,

Russell
