Who will get them?  I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversa=
tion and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect =
the privilege.  Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is n=
o protection if we find undesirable results.=20

Hi Michelle;
=20
Dovie told me that she has had a chat with you regarding the diversity stats=
 we were preparing for the VP PRC on 23 July.  Delainey had asked specifical=
ly for these stats, and that's why wewere including them.  Is there any way =
that we can provide the data, perhaps marking it attny privilidge?  If not, =
can we discuss this with Delainey so that he is aware of the reasons PEP PRC=
 cannot provide it?  I'd apprecuate your thoughts.  Thanks, Gina
