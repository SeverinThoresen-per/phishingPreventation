Great Gary,
Can you please do something quick to tell us what the Needles pressure need =
to be?
Thx

Subject:	Needles Pressure Requirement


I've got a copy of the SoCal contract for Needles.  The exact wording for th=
e pressure requirement is:

SECTION 5. PRESSURE.=20

Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Ar=
izona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PS=
IG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating press=
ure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parti=
es. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point s=
hall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement faci=
lity utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate=
 a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, an=
d flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such =
computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles C=
ompressor station.=20

It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the =
California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine t=
he required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 p=
sig at the state line.
