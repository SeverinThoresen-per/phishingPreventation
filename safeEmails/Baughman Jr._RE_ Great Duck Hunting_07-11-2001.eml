Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is=
 the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide se=
rvice out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose=
 hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporat=
e discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  =
they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog. =20

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you k=
now how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturda=
y or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle
