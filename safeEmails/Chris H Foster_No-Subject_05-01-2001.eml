Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for=20
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52. =20
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on=20
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an=
=20
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price=20
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we=20
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how=20
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how=
=20
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas=
=20
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should "0-out" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1=20
and 2 above.

Please call to discuss.

Chris
