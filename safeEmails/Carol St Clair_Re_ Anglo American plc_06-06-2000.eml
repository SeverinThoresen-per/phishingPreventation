Paul

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following=20
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the=20
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg,=20
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

Martin
