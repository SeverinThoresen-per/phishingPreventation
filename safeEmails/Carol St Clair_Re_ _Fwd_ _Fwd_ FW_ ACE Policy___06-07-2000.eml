Scott:
Our commercial guys are in Philly today meeting with ACE to discuss an=20
alternative online structure.  From what I know (which is very little at thi=
s=20
point), because of the amount of time that it takes to implement the auction=
=20
process online, our guys are looking into with ACE whether this product can=20
be offerred pursuant the normal posting procedures that we use for most of=20
our financial online derivative transactions.  Leslie and I are scheduled to=
=20
meet with them tomorrow at Noon Houston time so if you are available and we=20
can hook you in, let me know, otherwise one of us will catch up with you.  I=
=20
would alos think that we could discuss the revised policy at that time since=
=20
I don't think much will change if we go about it this way.
