Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of=20
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending m=
e=20
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the=20
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000=20

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the=20
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover th=
e=20
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it wil=
l=20
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

Carol
