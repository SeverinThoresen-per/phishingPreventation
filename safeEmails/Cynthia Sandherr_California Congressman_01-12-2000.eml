Hi, guys.  The House Commerce Committee currently has five Republican=20
vacancies with two likely to go to Californians.  Last week, Leadership=20
determined that Freshman Members are ineligible for this assignment. =20
Obviously it is important that these new California Members be supportive of=
=20
Enron on electricity restructuring.  Currently, Congresswoman Mary Bono and=20
Congressman George Radanovich have expressed their interest in securing=20
appointment to this Committee.  We can certainly work with these Members, bu=
t=20
are there other non-Freshman, California Republican Members who would be=20
better?  Many Members are unaware of how few Members are seeking these=20
vacancies so a little education on our part could sway their interest. =20
Please advise.   Many thanks.  Cynthia
