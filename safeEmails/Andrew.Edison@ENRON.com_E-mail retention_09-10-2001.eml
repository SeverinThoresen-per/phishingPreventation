As I mentioned to you last week, there are currently about 50 EBS employees =
who are exempt from the Enron e-mail retention policy.  These individuals we=
re exempted from the e-mail retention policy in order to preserve documents =
related to the Blockbuster litigation.  Now that the Blockbuster litigation =
is over, there is no reason for these individuals to continue to be exempt f=
rom the e-mail retention policy.  I propose sending the following  e-mail to=
 the currently exempt EBS employees:

_____________

For the past several months, because of the necessity to preserve documents =
relating to the Blockbuster litigation, you have been exempted from Enron's =
e-mail retention policy.  The Blockbuster litigation has now concluded.  The=
refore, beginning Monday, October 15, 2001, you will be subject to the e-mai=
l retention policy.  As a reminder, that policy provides as follows:

Message Location - Maximum Retention
Inbox - 30 days
Sent Mail Folder - 30 days
Trash/Deleted Items - Rollover from Inbox for one day
Folders - All Email messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one c=
alendar year. This includes public folders in Outlook.
Furthermore, it is against policy to store Email outside of your Outlook Mai=
lbox and/or your Public Folders.  Please do not copy Email onto floppy disks=
, zip disks, CDs or the network.  Such actions are prohibited and will not b=
e supported by the IT Department.

There will be no exceptions to this policy.
