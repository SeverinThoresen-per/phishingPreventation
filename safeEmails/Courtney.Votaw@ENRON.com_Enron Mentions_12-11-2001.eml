Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $8.85-billion (U.S.) takeover of Enron Corp. faces ma=
jor uncertainties, ranging from possible opposition from regulators to poten=
tially huge new liabilities and writeoffs at Enron.=20
The problem with regulators could come from antitrust worries about folding =
Houston-based Enron, the biggest U.S. trader of natural gas and electricity,=
 into Dynegy, another major energy trader, also based in Houston.
Enron currently handles a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity tra=
ded in the United States. The combined company -- which would be called Dyne=
gy Inc. -- would have 22,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 40,000 kil=
ometres of natural gas pipelines, making it one of the largest companies in =
the United States in each of those categories.=20
While Enron and Dynegy officials said they expect the merger to garner the n=
ecessary government approvals, the review by regulators is expected to take =
months.=20
As for unpleasant financial surprises, Enron has already produced a devastat=
ing stream of them over the past month, ranging from huge writeoffs of asset=
s and reductions of shareholder equity to major downward restatements of pas=
t earnings reports.=20
Much of this turmoil has been caused by Enron's dealings with private partne=
rships run by its own officers.=20
Indeed, recent Enron disclosures indicate that as much as half of the compan=
y's pretax earnings in recent years came from deals with these officer-relat=
ed partnerships, raising further questions about the quality of Enron's earn=
ings and the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars of additional wri=
teoffs or restatements.=20
Enron's partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder laws=
uits and a formal investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on.=20
In a measure of the continuing concerns over Enron's financial condition, bo=
th Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's once again downgraded Enr=
on's debt on Friday, this time to just one level above non-investment grade,=
 or "junk" status. They also kept the company under review for possible addi=
tional downgrades, and S&P put Dynegy on the same status.=20
A downgrade to junk status could force Enron to come up with hundreds of mil=
lions of dollars in cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financ=
ial transactions.=20
In an interview Friday, Dynegy chairman Chuck Watson said his company made "=
a good assessment" of Enron's condition and that in "the worst-case we can c=
ome up with . . . we feel comfortable [that] the value exceeds the liabiliti=
es."=20
Mr. Watson said Dynegy has given itself the opportunity to back out of the p=
roposed merger under certain conditions, which he declined to specify.=20
A person familiar with the deal said that Dynegy has a right to walk away if=
 Enron's additional legal and financial liabilities exceed $3.5-billion.=20
A Dynegy spokesman confirmed the figure.=20
The price being paid -- 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each Enron share -- is =
a fire-sale deal by any recent historical standard. The transaction valued E=
nron shares at $10.41 each, based on Dynegy's price of $38.76 Friday, up $2.=
26 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Enron shares rose 22 cents at $8.63 i=
n Big Board trading, a quarter of their price just a month ago and less than=
 a tenth of the all-time high of nearly $90 a share reached last year.=20
The deal envisions quickly pumping $1.5-billion of cash into Enron to bolste=
r its liquidity and comfort Enron's trading partners who are increasingly ne=
rvous about continuing their business. The funds will come from ChevronTexac=
o Corp., Dynegy's biggest shareholder with a 26-per-cent stake. Dynegy will =
use the money to purchase the preferred stock and other rights in an Enron p=
ipeline subsidiary.

Tata Power and BSES have offered about half the sum demanded for a majority =
shareholding in a controversial Indian power project beset by political prob=
lems.=20
Two Indian utilities have bid about half the $1.2bn that Enron demanded in S=
eptember for its majority stake in a controversial power plant near Bombay.
But the fate of the offers from Bombay-based Tata Power and BSES for India's=
 biggest and most politically divisive foreign direct investment remain unce=
rtain following Enron's absorption by Dynegy and legal moves by Indian credi=
tors challenging a possible sale.=20
Although Dynegy has not publicly commented on the $2.9bn Indian plant, obser=
vers say it is unlikely to welcome the political problems surrounding the pr=
oject and will press for a sale.=20
The board of DPC, Enron's Indian arm, is set to meet on November 19, the day=
 it was expected to announce a final notice that it was quitting the plant. =
But on Friday, Indian creditors won a temporary injunction in a Bombay court=
 restraining DPC until December 3.=20
Foreign and Indian creditors and DPC have been trying to broker a compromise=
 for months after a fall-out between DPC and its sole local customer, Mahara=
shtra State Electricity Board.=20
The latest attempt concluded on Saturday in Singapore just as a parallel dra=
ma over Enron's fate reached a climax in Houston. What started as a financia=
l restructuring exercise to salvage the Indian project rapidly turned into a=
 fire sale.=20
A decade ago, DPC was given fast-track clearance and was advertised as a sym=
bol of India's economic awakening. Its withdrawal is now seen as an indictme=
nt of the attempts to jump-start economic growth.=20
Critics portrayed DPC as arrogant and the company endured unremitting domest=
ic hostility. MSEB said DPC's tariffs were excessive. Environmentalists argu=
ed DPC benefited from a political process lacking transparency. Leftwing pol=
iticians insisted DPC's huge capacity was unnecessary.=20
DPC's patience snapped in April when it issued an initial termination notice=
=2E Since then it has been mired in a multitude of legal offensives.=20
In Singapore, Indian lenders, which carry an exposure of $1.4bn in loans and=
 guarantees to DPC, about 70 per of the total debt, said they were trying to=
 "match-make" between a weak DPC and an Indian party. "The talks were extrem=
ely positive and provide the basis of a deal," said a banker.=20
Tata Power and BSES, India's only solvent utilities, were the sole serious b=
idders. The dark horse was the government-owned National Thermal Power Corpo=
ration, which has working links with GE and Bechtel, the disaffected constru=
ctors and minority shareholders in DPC.=20
By Indian corporate standards, the low bids are still dizzily ambitious. But=
 both utilities enjoy powerful allies with deep pockets. BSES, for instance,=
 is 29 per cent owned by Reliance Industries, India's biggest private-sector=
 company. Tata Power is part of the formidable Tata industrial-to-financial =
services conglomerate.=20
Tata Power and BSES both have ambitious expansion plans in power, telecommun=
ications and broadband that could be hampered if their DPC bids succeed.=20
Yet, they would have much work to do at DPC, which analysts say is "unsustai=
nable in its present form". First, the new owner of Enron's 65 per cent stak=
e in DPC must lower tariffs.=20
Second, long-term power off-take contracts and payment guarantees must be se=
cured. MSEB, which holds a 15 per cent stake in DPC, is obliged to dispatch =
or "off-take" 90 per cent of DPC's output.=20
But MSEB has averaged only 60 per cent at phase 1 since it opened in May 199=
9. In effect, MSEB has been paying a lot more while using a lot less power.=20
The third challenge is to reopen the plant. Phase 1 closed in May after MSEB=
 stopped uplifting power. Work on phase 2 is also suspended.=20
A new owner would not only need to spend about $300m to complete phase 2; it=
 must also renegotiate contracts guaranteeing performance and warranties tha=
t have fallen into abeyance with the closure of the plant.=20

Watson puts trust in the quiet approach.

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
Charles Watson set out 16 years ago with "five guys and a smile" to build wh=
at would become Dynegy.=20
That same year, Kenneth Lay laid the foundations of Enron by merging the ass=
ets of two established companies. He had an inter-state and intra-state natu=
ral gas pipeline company with 37,000 miles of pipe.
Enron widened its lead over the years, so that last year it reported $101bn =
in revenue, to Dynegy's $29bn. It was the number-one seller of natural gas a=
nd power in North America and operated the biggest web-based transaction sys=
tem in the world.=20
But on Friday, the Dynegy chief executive brought his company out from Enron=
's shadow, agreeing to buy its embattled rival in a deal worth about $9bn in=
 stock. Overnight, Dynegy became the biggest energy trader in the US. How di=
d he do it?=20
Where Enron emphasised individuality, Dynegy stressed teamwork. Where Enron =
encouraged entrepreneurship, Dynegy stressed customer satisfaction. Where En=
ron urged aggression to pervade everything from its trading floors to its fi=
nancial accountings, Dynegy made friendliness and conservatism its culture.=20
Enron had its name emblazoned across Houston's professional baseball stadium=
 and was building an office tower in downtown Houston. Dynegy was renting 28=
 floors out of the Wells Fargo Complex.=20
Enron, Mr Watson notes, had a reputation for doing business with a swagger. =
"If that's your modus operandi, when things don't go well people come after =
you," Mr Watson says. He believes that image of cockiness made questions ove=
r Enron's balance sheet spiral out of control. The balance sheet adjustment =
itself could not justify the massive degradation of its equity in a matter o=
f weeks.=20
"The masses at Enron are thirsting for a change in image," Mr Watson says. H=
e intends to give them that.=20
Mr Watson will remain in charge when Dynegy takes control of Enron in the co=
ming months. He has asked Mr Lay to join the board, but Mr Lay has not made =
a decision. "It's been a good ride, for the most part," Mr Lay said Friday n=
ight, but added, "I would say the last three weeks have not been a lot of fu=
n."=20
Mr Watson reached out to Mr Lay on October 24, as the crisis of confidence i=
n Enron became increasingly untenable. The Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n was investigating its finances, investors were dumping its stock and the c=
redit rating agencies were downgrading its debt.=20
Mr Watson's mother was having heart surgery and he was with her in Saint Lou=
is.=20
But he called Mr Lay to offer to help. In the back of his mind was the possi=
bility of buying Enron's valuable pipeline assets to provide it with liquidi=
ty to support its fast diminishing business.=20
Two days later, Mr Watson went over to Mr Lay's home to begin working toward=
s a combination.=20
In a meeting with Mr Lay and the rest of Enron's management team, it became =
clear they were "willing to fix the problem whatever it took".=20
Mr Watson believes the deal was put together so quickly because Dynegy works=
 with Enron on a daily basis, they know each other's people and businesses, =
and they are both based in Houston.=20
"We're one of the few people, maybe the only ones, who could have pulled it =
off," he says.=20
Now that he has done so, Mr Watson plans to move into Enron's new buildings,=
 but has not decided whether to rename the stadium to reflect its new owner.=
 His teenager wants him too. But that would seem to go against the modesty t=
hat enabled Dynegy to win in the end.=20

Ratings prove crucial at Enron.
By JENNY WIGGINS IN NEW YORK.

11/12/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
Credit ratings agencies consider themselves independent providers of researc=
h and information. But the role played by Moody's Investors Service in the s=
ale of Enron to Dynegy last week shows agencies are often more than dispassi=
onate observers.=20
In Enron's case, its credit ratings were crucial to its survival. The compan=
y needed an investment grade credit rating to retain the confidence of its e=
nergy trading counterparties.
Enron's solution was to arrange an acquisition by Dynegy, but first it recei=
ved the credit agencies' blessing.=20
With the two companies close to a deal on Friday morning, Moody's responded =
to investor concerns about the company by downgrading the company's ratings =
to just one notch above junk.=20
However, it also signalled it was prepared to sanction a deal, adding that "=
a substantial near-term injection of equity capital" would be viewed as "a s=
tabilising event". That arrived in the form of a $1.5bn cash injection from =
ChevronTexaco.=20
The ratings agency was under pressure to provide a credit outlook. Enron gen=
erated "a tremendous amount of interest", including calls from market partic=
ipants "who wanted to share their opinion", said Moody's Fran Laserson.=20
Moody's analyst John Diaz said that while the agency had analysed Enron's fi=
nancials both on and off its balance sheet, there were "some issues" the age=
ncy had not been aware of.=20
This means that even as they seek to point out the risks inherent in a compa=
ny's balance sheet, they are also looking out for the long-term interest of =
a company and are willing to give troubled entities some time to deal with p=
roblems and get back on their feet.=20

Dynegy's Rushed Gamble on Enron Carries Some Big Risks
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/12/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
Call it a $9 billion shotgun wedding.=20
Dynegy Inc., an energy marketer and trader based in Houston, took the bigges=
t gamble in its corporate history on Friday by agreeing to buy the Enron Cor=
poration, its much larger crosstown rival, for more than $9 billion in stock=
=2E In one decisive move, Chuck Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, positioned h=
is company to become the most important player in the volatile but potential=
ly lucrative business of trading natural gas and electricity.
But the hastily arranged deal carries big risks for Dynegy as well, skeptica=
l investors and Wall Street analysts say. No one outside Enron appears to un=
derstand the company's tangled finances fully, and the speed with which the =
deal was made did not give Dynegy time to scrutinize in great detail Enron's=
 trading book or the web of partnerships Enron has entered to move debt off =
its balance sheet and hide losses.=20
The skeptics wonder why Dynegy decided to take on Enron's huge debt, which s=
ome analysts say could total $23 billion in loans on and off its balance she=
et, instead of simply trying to hire away Enron's best traders, some of whom=
 were already leaving the company.=20
''There are many risks associated with this merger that we will not know abo=
ut for a while,'' said Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ''W=
e're not sure that we know everything there is to know at Enron yet.''=20
In addition, Enron's earnings could be far lower than it has reported, said =
James Chanos, a short-seller who has been a vocal critic. On Thursday, Enron=
 said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had us=
ed partnerships to overstate its earnings by a total of $600 million over th=
e last five years. Mr. Chanos said other information in the filing indicated=
 that more restatements were possible.=20
With so much uncertainty surrounding Enron's finances, Mr. Chanos and other =
analysts question Dynegy's decision to move so quickly.=20
They note that Dynegy and Enron often traded with each other, and some analy=
sts had wondered whether, if Enron had filed for bankruptcy, those trades mi=
ght be wiped out, leaving Dynegy unhedged, or unprotected against sudden mov=
ements in the prices of natural gas or electricity.=20
If, on the other hand, Enron is not forced to restate its profits down furth=
er, then Dynegy has clinched an amazing bargain. Analysts say Enron will mak=
e $1.80 a share this year, so Dynegy is paying just six times Enron's annual=
 earnings, about a fourth the average ratio of companies in the Standard & P=
oor's 500.=20
Dynegy said on Friday that the deal should increase its per-share earnings n=
ext year by 90 to 95 cents, to $3.40 to $3.50, even without factoring in up =
to a half-billion dollars in annual savings, before taxes, from the merger. =
Dynegy's shares closed Friday at $38.76, up $2.26, so if the company's forec=
ast is accurate, it is trading at 11 times its 2002 earnings -- still a barg=
ain compared with the average stock in the S.&. P 500.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company in Houston, said Dynegy's es=
timates for its earnings in 2002 were ''conservative and very achievable.''=20
Mr. Watson said Friday that Dynegy was confident that Enron's operations and=
 its trading business were healthy. ''We feel this is a very solid company w=
ith plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months,'' =
he said.=20
Mr. Dietert said Dynegy needed to strike a deal with Enron quickly to make s=
ure that Enron's trading operations and financial health did not deteriorate=
 any further. ''If Enron preserves the value of the marketing and trading co=
mpany, then there is clearly value in the Enron stock,'' he said.=20
Preserving Enron's investment-grade credit rating is crucial to keeping the =
trading operation afloat. To help convince Moody's Investors Service and Sta=
ndard & Poor's, the major rating agencies, that Enron's rating should remain=
 investment-grade, Dynegy has agreed to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immed=
iately. Still, on Friday, both agencies cut Enron's rating to just one notch=
 above noninvestment grade, or junk, status, and both suggested that the rat=
ing could fall further.=20
So investors and creditors will watch carefully this week to see whether oth=
er energy companies continue trading with Enron, and whether the merger stem=
s the outflow of talented Enron traders.=20
Another question hanging over the deal is how easy it will be for Dynegy to =
walk away if Enron's finances turn out to be worse that Enron has already di=
sclosed.=20
The merger agreement, according to executives and investment bankers who sha=
ped it, gives Dynegy the opportunity to quit the deal without penalty if maj=
or new problems surface. But what exactly those terms are remains unknown.=20
So far, investors are giving Dynegy the benefit of the doubt. The company's =
stock rose 17 percent on Thursday and Friday.=20
''The market believes Chuck Watson and the Dynegy management team are very d=
isciplined in the way they manage risks,'' Mr. Dietert said.

Basic Principle Of Accounting Tripped Enron
By Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/12/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from En=
ron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some crit=
ics say.=20
Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a leng=
thy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declarin=
g that its financial statements going back to 1997 "should not be relied upo=
n" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged ov=
erstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financi=
al statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turn=
s out, they were just plain wrong.
But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enr=
on's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas f=
or the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practi=
ces amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some account=
ing specialists say.=20
Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, de=
clines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be=
 bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previou=
s financial statements an "unfortunate situation" and says Andersen is coope=
rating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed b=
y Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices.=20
Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder eq=
uity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in t=
he company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about becaus=
e it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnershi=
ps with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged=
 that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accept=
ed accounting principles.=20
Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of i=
ts own common stock to four "special-purpose entities," in exchange for whic=
h it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-r=
eceivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called "an accou=
nting error" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receiv=
es when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enro=
n's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receiva=
ble assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudite=
d statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement r=
epresents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June =
30.=20
"It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and=
 a note doesn't count as cash," says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant =
for the SEC. "The question that raises is: How did both partners and the man=
ager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?" Adds Douglas Carmi=
chael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: "Anyone that's=
 an accountant looking at the entry should have known" it violated GAAP.=20
An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, "The accounting error was just that -=
- an error," explaining that, "We believed it was not material. However, it =
was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen=
's concurrence." He says Andersen "performed limited quarterly reviews" of t=
he company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that re=
sulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements "to the extent they deemed n=
ecessary."=20
To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to=
 it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multi=
ple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a=
 list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of t=
he clients may change, the issues remain largely the same.=20
For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figu=
re that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming r=
estatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 =
million in various unexplained "audit adjustments and reclassifications" tha=
t its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be "im=
material." Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly hal=
f of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's r=
estatements.=20
That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May s=
ettlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so m=
any violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produc=
e significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the bare=
ly solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed=
 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the =
SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the And=
ersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in=
 a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegat=
ions. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes t=
he lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of p=
rofessional judgment.=20
Under GAAP, misstatements aren't immaterial simply because they fall beneath=
 a numerical threshold, according to an SEC accounting bulletin. Under certa=
in circumstances -- and it remains to be seen if they apply in the Enron cas=
e -- the SEC says intentional immaterial misstatements are unlawful. One rea=
son is that when immaterial misstatements are combined with other misstateme=
nts, they can "render the financial statements taken as a whole to be materi=
ally misleading."=20
Enron, which paid Andersen $25 million last year in audit fees and $27 milli=

olt, the Andersen spokesman, says the SEC hasn't told Andersen it is a subje=
ct of the Enron probe.=20
Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements also is a major embar=
rassment for the directors who sit on the Enron board's audit committee, whi=
ch serves as the overseer of Enron's financial reporting, internal controls =
and compliance processes. Among the committee members is Wendy Gramm, a form=
er chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the wife of U.S.=
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas). Ms. Gramm also was a member of the audit commi=
ttee of IBP Inc., a meatpacking company that earlier this year became engulf=

railed Tyson Foods' since-completed plan to buy the company.=20
Enron last week said its audit committee had been responsible for conducting=
 annual reviews of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships run b=

Dynegy's Enron Deal Faces Uncertainties --- Potential Antitrust Worries Or N=

Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $8.85 billion takeover of Enron Corp. faces major unc=
ertainties, ranging from possible opposition from regulators to potentially =
huge new liabilities and write-offs at Enron.=20
The problem with regulators could come from antitrust worries about folding =
Enron, the nation's biggest trader of natural gas and electricity, into Dyne=
gy, also a major energy trader. Enron handles a quarter of all the natural g=
as and electricity traded in the U.S. The combined company -- which would be=
 called Dynegy Inc. -- would have 22,000 megawatts of generating capacity an=
d 25,000 miles of natural-gas pipelines, making it one of the largest compan=
ies in the nation in each of those categories. While Enron and Dynegy offici=
als said that they expect the merger to garner the necessary government appr=
ovals, the review by regulators is expected to take months.
As for unpleasant financial surprises, Enron has already produced a devastat=
ing stream of them over the past month, ranging from huge write-offs of asse=
ts and reductions of shareholder equity to major downward restatements of pa=
st earnings reports. Much of this turmoil has been caused by Enron's dealing=
s with private partnerships run by its own officers. Indeed, recent Enron di=
sclosures indicate that as much as half of the company's pretax earnings in =
recent years came from deals with these officer-related partnerships, raisin=
g further questions about the quality of Enron's earnings and the potential =
for hundreds of millions of dollars of additional write-offs or restatements=
=2E=20
Enron's partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder laws=
uits and a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. I=
n a measure of the continuing concerns over Enron's financial condition, bot=
h Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's once again downgraded Enro=
n's debt on Friday, this time to just one level above noninvestment-grade, o=
r "junk," status. They also kept the company under review for possible addit=
ional downgrades and S&P put Dynegy on the same status. A downgrade to junk =
status could force Enron to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in =
cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financial transactions.=20

Analysts, Competitors Give Dynegy-Enron Merger Thumbs Up

(This article was originally published Friday)=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Analysts and market competitors said late Friday t=
hat the newly-announced merger between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (EN=
E) will be a positive development for Dynegy and for the wholesale energy ma=
rkets.
"I think Dynegy got a fantastic deal," said Ron Barone, managing director of=
 UBS Warburg. "This just propels the company to a new plateau and plane. As =
for Enron, this was the best they could do given the mistakes they made."=20
The deal, announced Friday, will have Dynegy buy Enron for about $8 billion-=
$9 billion in stock. Dynegy will swap 0.2685 share for each Enron share, and=
 immediately infuse $1.5 billion in asset-backed equity to Enron. ChevronTex=
aco Corp. (CVX), which owns 26% of Dynegy, will invest $2.5 billion in new e=
quity into Dynegy.=20
Enron's stock price has fallen about 80% in the past three weeks, and its cr=
edit rating has been downgraded to one level above noninvestment grade, due =
to uncertainties about the transparency of its complex financial structure. =
The energy giant is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion over transactions with entities headed by former Chief Financial Offic=
er Andrew Fastow.=20
Dynegy comes out of the merger as a white knight, while Enron's reputation i=
s still in question, said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Str=
eet, an analysis firm in Cambridge, Mass.=20
"It looks like a good deal for Dynegy. But if they can buy Enron for $10.40 =
a share, it makes you wonder about Enron's recent 8-K filing, which made thi=
ngs look pretty good. If it were so good, they wouldn't be selling for $10.4=
0 a share," Roberts said.=20
Regulators Seen Approving Merger=20

Federal regulators will probably approve the deal, because they want to make=
 sure the energy markets are safe, Roberts said.=20
"A lot of people are exposed here, and this is an arranged marriage to save =
the market. This deal has to get done because Enron is in trouble and there =
are too many parties at risk."=20
Before the merger was announced, U.S. natural gas and electricity traders ha=
d begun cutting back business with Enron, accepting lower bids or higher off=
ers from competitors rather than take on the credit risk of trading with the=
 struggling market leader.=20
That should change with the announcement of the merger, analysts said.=20
"Traders were backing off of Enron because there were questions about how lo=
ng it would survive without an equity injection," Barone said. "It's in ever=
yone's best interest that the merger be completed as fast as possible to mai=
ntain liquidity and stability in the market."=20
Barone added that while the merger would create a "super global powerhouse,"=
 he didn't think competitors should be worried.=20
"I think they'll be fine. They wanted this successfully resolved because if =
Enron were illiquid they would have had problems, the market would have had =
problems," he said.=20
A Mirant Corp. (MIR) spokesman said that while "the market is bigger than ju=
st Enron was," the merger is a positive step.=20
"Dynegy's involvement is good for the market. There will be a lot of opportu=
nity in the market going forward," said spokesman Chuck Griffin.=20
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the merger will create a more compet=
itive market player.=20
"Dynegy is a formidable company, and the merger will create a marketplace wi=
th an even more formidable competitor," Wheatley said.=20
Consumer Advocates Oppose Merger=20

Consumer advocates said the merger raised issues of market dominance.=20
"The only thing worse than the current energy cartel would be the more tight=
ly-controlled cartel to come out of an Enron-Dynegy merger. We will oppose t=
his merger and urge state and federal authorities to oppose it as well," sai=
d Doug Heller, attorney for California's Foundation for Taxpayer and Consume=
r Rights, shortly before the merger was officially announced.=20
A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said it was too e=
arly to comment on the merger, but said it was the type of transaction the o=
ffice had examined in the past.=20
"Our office has looked into corporate mergers before over concerns about the=
ir impact on competition in the marketplace in California," said spokeswoman=
 Sandy Michioku.=20
California has a rocky history with Dynegy and Enron, both of which have bee=
n accused by consumer advocates and Democratic politicians of overcharging t=
he state for wholesale electricity.=20

IN THE MONEY: 2 Stories In 1: Enron CEO Sold Compaq Stk
By Michael Rapoport

11/12/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column (This column was first published Friday)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Two of the biggest business stories of the past week =
have been the opposition to the planned merger of Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP) =
and Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and the continuing troubles of Enron Corp. (=
ENE).
Who would've thought they'd turn out to have a connection, at least a tenuou=
s one?=20
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, is a member of Compaq's b=
oard. And less than two weeks ago, he sold a big chunk of his stake in Compa=
q - for a price that appears to be significantly less than what he could've =
gotten had he simply waited for the H-P deal to be completed.=20
According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Friday, La=
y sold 124,596 Compaq shares - more than a quarter of his Compaq stake - on =
Oct. 29 for $9.25 a share. The filing doesn't give a reason for the sale but=
 notes that as a Compaq director, Lay is restricted by the company to tradin=
g in its stock only during limited specified periods.=20
Here's the funny thing, though: Given the exchange ratio in the H-P/Compaq m=
erger, as well as H-P's stock price at the time, Compaq shareholders stood t=
o get about $11 worth of H-P stock for each Compaq share at the time Lay sol=
d his shares.=20
So Lay sold at $9.25 a share at a time when his stock was essentially worth =
$11 a share if the deal is completed. He reaped about $1.15 million in proce=
eds from the sale, but that's about $220,000 less than the shares were worth=
 at the time under the merger with H-P.=20
Boy, that's a vote of confidence in the merger, isn't it - leaving $220,000 =
on the table? It's also worth noting that Lay could find the time to attend =
to his personal finances even as his own company was facing mounting questio=
ns about its financial structure and transactions.=20
The latest development that threw the H-P/Compaq merger into serious jeopard=
y - the announcement that H-P's founding Hewlett family, which holds 5% of t=
he company's stock, intends to oppose the deal - didn't occur till more than=
 a week after Lay's sale, and there's no indication that Lay knew anything a=
bout it at the time he sold his shares. But that's irrelevant: If you're a C=
ompaq director and you're confident that the H-P merger is going to go throu=
gh and provide you with a premium, why would you sell AT ALL? Ever?=20
Surely Lay isn't hurting for money. According to Enron's proxy statement, he=
 earned a salary of $1.3 million and a bonus of $7 million in 2000, plus $7.=
5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a p=
ersonal plane.=20
There may be a good reason for Lay's sale, but if there is, Enron isn't prov=
iding it. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on Lay's sale of Compaq s=
tock. A Compaq spokesman couldn't be reached.=20
Granted, this is very much a sideshow both to the H-P/Compaq deal and Enron'=
s own quagmire, in which the company wiped out $586 million worth of earning=
s Thursday by admitting that some off-balance-sheet entities should have bee=
n on Enron's balance sheet after all. But given the shellshock that H-P, Com=
paq and Enron shareholders have been through this week, they deserve more of=
 an explanation about this from Lay than a quiet, after-the-fact SEC filing.=

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - UBS Warburg on Monday reiterated its "strong bu=

 Friday to buy its bigger rival Enron Corp. for some $9 billion in stock.=20
"If successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely reco=

But it added that pursuant to the deal, Dynegy faces a daunting task of merg=

It said, "We note that we would not be surprised to see Dynegy put on review=

initial stages of such a transaction".=20
Dynegy shares closed on Friday at $38.76 on the New York Stock Exchange.

USA: RESEARCH ALERT-Prudential raises Enron to 'hold'.

11/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Prudential Securities on Monday raised its inve=
stment rating on Enron Corp. to "hold" from "sell," citing the proposed buyo=
ut of the company by its smaller power-trading rival Dynegy Inc. for some $9=
 billion in stock.=20
The brokerage said in a research note that it believes capital infusion from=
 the deal will help Enron fill near-term liquidity needs.
But it added that it is uncertain whether the deal will help prevent Enron's=
 energy-trading partners from reducing transactions and/or credit exposure o=
ver the next few months.=20
Prudential said it is also concerned about strategic and cultural difference=
s between Dynegy and Enron, and believes that the risk of losing talented tr=
aders before the transaction closes is high.=20
The buyout, announced on Friday, calls for Dynegy to swap 0.2685 share for e=
ach Enron share, valuing Enron at $10.41 a share. Enron is also in the midst=
 of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over question=
able business practices in the past. Enron closed at $8.63 on the New York S=
tock Exchange on Friday.

Thames company sets sights on takeover

Copyright (C) 2001 Western Daily Press; Source: World Reporter (TM)
WESSEX Water could become a takeover target for Thames Water as troubles con=
tinue to engulf its U.S.=20
parent.
The Bath-based utility, which employs around 1,500 people, is one of several=
 UK businesses owned by Enron, which last week was forced to slice more than=
 $500 million (GBP354 million) from its reported profits for the past five y=
ears.=20
Enron's much-smaller rival Dynergy is set to buy the troubled giant for $8 b=
illion (GBP5.6 billion) - although the plunging value of Enron has become a =
sticking point.=20
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural g=
as, bought Wessex for GBP1.4 billion in 1998.=20
At the time it said it planned to use Wessex's expertise as the foundation s=
tone of global water company Azurix.=20
But few contracts have been secured as Azurix has constantly found itself ou=
tbid by larger groups and the failure of the water business has only added t=
o Enron's troubles.=20
Weekend speculation suggested Thames Water was poised to pounce on Wessex as=
 Enron's financial position gets weaker.=20
Thames Water's German utility group owner RWE is keen to expand its water in=
terests in the UK and has considered bidding for Wessex in the past.=20
In August it was said to be running the slide rule over the firm to bolster =
its UK interests.=20
It acquired Thames, the neighbouring water company to Wessex, last year for =
GBP4.3 billion.=20
A Thames move for Wessex would attract the attention of the industry regulat=
or and previous similar takeover bids have been blocked.=20
But the fact that the two are neighbours - Wessex supplies an area stretchin=
g from Wiltshire to Somerset and Dorset, while Thames goes from London to Sw=
indon - could weigh in the favour of any bid, along with Enron's shaky finan=
cial position.=20
Enron last week acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 per cent ove=
r the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets =
through business partnerships now under investigation by the U.S. Securities=
 and Exchange Commission.=20
The SEC said Enron's financial statements from 1997 through the first half o=
f 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that outside businesses run by Enron =
officials during that period should have been included in the company's earn=
ings reports.=20
Enron's debt ratings have also been reduced to one level above junk bond sta=
tus and the company's long-term debt ratings remain under review for further=
 downgrade.=20
On Friday UK energy watchdog Ofgem said it was monitoring how the financial =
crisis could impact on the UK market.=20
As well as owning Wessex, Enron has three power plants on Teesside whose cus=
tomers include suppliers, generators and distributors.

India: Enron in trouble; Microsoft sees reprieve
setting up these private partnerships and making deals with them,

ENRON is facing corruption charges, and this time it has nothing to do with =
Maharashtra! The shock waves began when the company announced in early Octob=
er that it had a $618 million (Rs 2,966 crore) loss in the third quarter and=
 also disclosed write-offs to the tune of $1.2 billion (Rs 5,760 crore) due =
to some questionable transactions.=20
Two of these deals were made public in the last couple of weeks. In one, Mr =
Andrew Fastow, the company's Chief Financial Officer, ran a private partners=
hip called LJM2 Co-Investment LP (named with the initials of his wife and ch=
ildren) with whom Enron had several financial transactions. The aim of the t=
ransactions was to hedge against fluctuating values in some of Enron's inves=
tments.
Mr Fastow and other Enron employees who were a part of this partnership made=
 millions in fees and investment gains in their personal accounts.=20
Mr. Fastow was fired after the revelations. Second, the company is said to h=
ave made a $35-million (Rs 168-crore) purchase from an entity called Chewco =
Investments LP, run by Michael Kopper, managing director of its North Americ=
a unit. This deal is seen as an attempt by Enron to park some of its debt el=
sewhere.=20
Enron, which began as a natural gas and energy products company, has made im=
portant forays into retail energy and bandwidth products. And its growth has=
 been phenomenal. From $13 billion (Rs 62,400 crore) in revenues in 1996, th=
e company, in 2000, had revenues of $100 billion (Rs 80,000 crore). In 1999-=
 2000 alone, it grew 150 per cent.=20
As an energy trader, the company is a dominant force in the markets.=20
It extended its trading skills and software infrastructure into the bandwidt=
h area, where it has met with more limited success. However, another venture=
, named Azurix, focussed on managing water supply and headed by Rebecca Mark=
 (of Dabhol fame) was a failure, leading to her exit from the company.=20
Some analysts are now beginning to wonder if the phenomenal results of the c=
ompany have something to do with its creative accounting. Enron is said to h=
ave borrowed large sums of money for asset purchases without the debt showin=
g up on the company's balance sheet.=20
Analysts who often write about Enron use terms like 'Byzantine' and 'labyrin=
th' in describing its financial dealings. Now, they are admitting that they =
did not really understand what was going on. Enron has been very secretive w=
hen it comes to revealing its financial arrangements.=20
Clearly, the company seems to have se -up all these private partnerships to =
make its balance sheet look clean and nice. In return, it allowed its senior=
 employees to profit and fatten their wallets through the fees paid for the =
transactions. Was it the price paid to keep quiet? S&P and Moody's have lowe=
red the company's credit rating. Its stock price has fallen from a high of a=
bout $85 (Rs 4,080) a year ago to about $13 (Rs 624) now. And newspapers are=
 speculating that the company may be bought over. The Securities and Exchang=
e Commission of the US has begun investigating the company. But Enron and it=
s Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, are major contributors to President Bush and his=
 Republican Party. So don't hold your breath.=20
The immediate question that arises is that Enron's Board must have been awar=
e of these conflicts of interest, where employees were benefiting in private=
 deals they were making with, and on behalf of, the company.=20
This is especially glaring in the case of Mr Fastow, who made the decision o=
n both sides of the fence - that is, as CFO of Enron and as the managing par=
tner of the partnership he was running. Why was the board sitting quiet abou=
t the corruption at this level? A look at the board's composition provides s=
ome interesting information.=20
Apart from several luminaries in the energy and petroleum fields, three indi=
viduals should draw attention. One is Mr Norman Blake, a former Secretary Ge=
neral of the US Olympic Committee, an agency that was not so long ago caught=
 in a scandal involving pay-offs to secure hosting rights for the games.=20
Another is a Professor Robert Jaedicke, a professor of Accounting at Stanfor=
d University. A third is Ms Wendy Gramm, a former Chairperson of the US Comm=
odity Futures Trading Commission. If nobody else, these people should be exp=
erienced in recognising managed accounting figures, and in smelling suspicio=
us deals. Clearly, a lot of people at Enron were looking the other way, inte=
ntionally or accidentally.=20
The company claims, in its website, that "It is difficult to talk about Enro=
n without using the word 'innovative"'. How true!=20
And Microsoft scores=20
While Enron is getting into trouble, Microsoft is trying to climb out of it.=
 In 1998, the US federal government, along with about 20 state governments, =
filed a suit against Microsoft charging it with monopolistic practices. The =
trial court held against the company and a new judge who was appointed has b=
een pushing the parties to settle.=20
A tentative settlement was announced on November 2 and it seems, at first gl=
ance, that all the effort will not make the company behave any different.=20
Among others, the settlement requires Microsoft to disclose technical data t=
o help competitors make programs; PC manufacturers will have more freedom to=
 ship machines with non- Microsoft products and the company cannot retaliate=
 against them; and it will have to establish standard royalties and licensin=
g terms. More interestingly, a three-member panel will be located at Microso=
ft headquarters with staff and access to company records to monitor complian=
ce with the settlement. The period is initially for five years, and is exten=
dable to two more.=20
While Microsoft may not secure high marks for the quality of its products, t=
he company has always been a leader with its strategy. Though technology-sav=
vy users of personal computers have always praised Apple for its hardware an=
d its operating system, Microsoft is the one that has climbed to dominate wi=
th 90 per cent market share. And this is because it quickly worked with alli=
es to establish its operating system as the more widely used standard.=20
With comparable astuteness, the company managed to drag the anti-trust case =
long enough till a more sympathetic President occupied the White House. The =
anti-trust head under the Democratic President Clinton was Joel Klein, who w=
as seen as a hawk, doggedly pursuing the company.=20
So Microsoft waited it out, while making significant monetary contributions =
to the Republican Party. Even on the campaign trail, Mr George Bush made it =
known that he was not such a fervent devotee of anti-trust.=20
Once he came to power, the newly appointed anti-trust chief quickly moved to=
 compromise and settle.=20
The proposed settlement is not leaving everyone happy. The other private cor=
porations that were affected by Microsoft's practices are clearly disappoint=
ed with the terms of the settlement. America Online, now incarnated as AOL T=
ime Warner, is the biggest Internet service provider, with about 30 million =
subscribers, and benefited from partnership with Microsoft. But the new Wind=
ows XP only has the company's own MSN service and its own messaging system, =
cutting out AOL.=20
Sun Microsystems is another affected party. Sun's Java software allowed the =
same piece of computer code to run on many different kinds of computers. But=
 the new Windows XP has dropped support for Java. Thus, both Sun and AOL, am=
ong others, feel closed out and do not see any change in Microsoft's monopol=
istic behaviour.=20
It is this fact that has also upset about six of the state governments, whic=
h are also parties to the suit. At the time of writing, they have refused to=
 sign on. Massachusetts, for one, has protested that it is an ineffectual de=
al.=20
Microsoft bravely moves on, surviving a possible threat of break-up, like a =
juggernaut crushing all that come in its path. But a recent Wall Street Jour=
nal report has it that the controversy has taken its toll within, that emplo=
yee morale is down, and several key people have left the company. Even if it=
 manages to close the chapter on its US legal troubles, the company still fa=
ces an investigation by the European Commission.=20

Unravelling the Dynegy enigma

Dynegy? What Dynegy? This reflex query has been doing rounds in India ever s=
ince the merger of energy major Enron Inc with it was announced last week.=20
So, what is Dynegy?
For starters, the company shares the same headquarters as Enron Houston; and=
 was even founded in the same year, 1985.=20
It was set up by Chuck Watson but the largest shareholder in the company is =
really oil major Chevron Texaco, with about 27 per cent.=20
Despite its attempt to swallow a corporation that is thrice its size, Dynegy=
 is no piffling either.=20
It is one of the world's leading energy merchants and had revenues of nearly=
 $30 billion for the year 2000, and has crossed the $ 33 billion mark in the=
 first nine months of 2001. It is a Fortune 100 company (positioned 54th) an=
d finds a place in the Standard & Poors 500 index to boot.=20
It is also in very similar lines of business to Enron. Like that controversi=
al company it is a trader of natural gas, electricity, coal and broadband. T=
he synergies of such a merger are obvious. Dynegy is also into power generat=
ion and distribution and is a leading player in the North American market. I=
t has 43 generating station with a aggregate capacity of 19,000 mw. Last yea=
r it sold 138 million units of electricity and has already sold 213 million =
units this year. Most of its power delivery is routed through subsidiary Ill=
inois Power.=20
On the broadband front, the company has a 21,900 mile optic fibre network. A=
bout 16, 800 miles of this is in the United States while the balance 5,100 m=
iles is in Europe.=20
Dynegy has a presence in 16 countries with a total workforce of 6,700. Dyneg=
y is not stranger to India. Last year it signed a memorandum of understandin=
g with the Jatiyas of Wimco for setting up a joint venture company to set up=
 a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) import terminal at Okha in Gujarat.=20
Apart from this the two parties were planning to set up LPG bottling plants =
together. The cost of the project was estimated at Rs 1,000 crore. After the=
 deal with Enron goes through it will become the latest player in the Dabhol=
 drama. Meanwhile, international ratings agency Moody's Investors Service on=
 Friday said it cut its long-term and short-term ratings for embattled energ=
y trader Enron Corporation and warned it could cut the ratings again because=
 of a substantial loss of investor confidence. Moody's cut Enron's senior un=
secured debt ratings to "Baa3," its lowest investment grade, from "Baa2." It=
 also cut the company's commercial paper rating to "Not Prime" from "Prime-2=
=2E"=20
If Moody's cut Enron's long-term rating again, it would take it to a junk le=
vel. A downgrade would make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its d=
ay-to-day business. The downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merge=
r with rival Dynegy Inc, which has been in talks to acquire Enron.=20
Dynegy and Enron have asked for an expedited review of the merger from Moody=
's and Standard & Poor's. Enron shares traded Friday on the New York Stock E=
xchange down $1.15 at $7.25.

Dynegy Throws Enron $44bn Lifeline

One of the world's largest energy trading groups, Enron Corp, has staved off=
 financial collapse after securing a $US23 billion ($44.8 billion) rescue bi=
d from Dynegy, ending a crisis which threatened to cause major disruption to=
 US power and natural-gas markets.=20
Enron shares have plunged 90 per cent this year following investigations by =
US regulatory authorities into accounting irregularities which limited its a=
bility to finance operations.
Under the terms of the deal struck in the United States on Friday, investors=
 will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
This is worth $US10.41, based on Dynegy's closing price on Friday.=20
ChevronTexaco Corp, a 26 per cent shareholder in Dynegy, has agreed to provi=
de Enron with an upfront cash injection of $US1.5 billion. Dynegy said it wo=
uld assume about $US15 billion in Enron debt.=20
The new company will have $US90 billion in assets while Dynegy's shareholder=
s, including ChevronTexaco, will have 64 per cent of the new company. Enron'=
s holders will own the rest.=20
However, the deal is likely to be opposed by consumers in California after D=
ynegy and Enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left that St=
ate's biggest utility bankrupt and the second-largest fighting for a governm=
ent bailout.=20
In recent months, Enron shares plunged as investors began to question the ac=
curacy of Enron's financial statements, saying it was unclear whether the co=
mpany was using affiliated partnerships to move debt off its books and hide =
losses.=20
On Friday, the company restated its earnings for the past four years, loweri=
ng them by more than $US500 million to include losses from partnerships it o=
nce kept off its books. After the merger announcement, Standard & Poor's Inv=
estors Service said it may lower Dynegy's debt rating. It cut Enron's to ``B=
BB,'' one notch above junk.=20
Dynegy will have annual revenue of more than $US200 billion, more than 22,00=
0 MW of electric-generating capacity and 40,000 km of pipeline after the mer=

The company would save as much as $US500 million a year by ``winding down'' =

Andersen Faces Jeopardy in Enron Accounting Error, Experts Say

Andersen Faces Jeopardy in Enron Accounting Error, Experts Say

     Houston, Nov.12 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP may face
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sanction and shareholder
lawsuits because it certified Enron Corp. financial reports that
the company disavowed last week as inaccurate, legal and
accounting experts said.

     Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Last week, the company
reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over four-
and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     Enron restated its financial reports as the company
suffered a cash crisis triggered by disclosure of the cut in
shareholder equity and the start of an SEC investigation. On
Friday, Enron, the largest energy trader, agreed to be
acquired by Dynegy Inc. for $23 billion in stock and assumed
debt.

     ``I'd be very surprised if the SEC didn't go after Arthur
Andersen,'' said Alan Bromberg, securities law professor at
Southern Methodist University and author of a six-volume treatise
on securities fraud. ``I think they'll have a hard time ignoring
this one.''

     Andersen partner David Tabolt has said the firm is
cooperating with a special committee of Enron's board of
directors appointed to investigate the accounting problems.

     ``Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to
restate its financial statements and advise investors that they
should not rely on its financial statements or our audit
reports,'' Tabolt said, adding, ``We certainly recognize the
appropriateness of that decision.''

                        Settled Suits

     The SEC and shareholders can sue an accounting company for
issuing false and misleading financial reports about a publicly
traded company. Andersen this year paid $130 million to settle
lawsuits alleging the firm allowed Waste Management Inc. and
Sunbeam Corp. to file false financial reports that cost investors
billions of dollars in losses.

      Lynn Turner, who was the SEC's chief accountant for three
years until he resigned in August, said Enron and Andersen
ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated
shareholder's equity.

      Explaining the equity reduction last week, Enron said
it had given common stock to companies created by Enron's
former chief financial officer in exchange for notes
receivable, and then improperly increased shareholder equity
on its balance sheet by the value of the notes.

                     'Basic Accounting'

     ``What we teach in college is that you don't record equity
until you get cash for it, and a note is not cash,'' said Turner,
who is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting
at Colorado State University. ``It's a mystery how both the
company would violate, and the auditors would miss, such a basic
accounting rule, when the number is one billion dollars.''

     Enron paid Andersen $52 million last year, $25 million for
auditing and $27 million for services including business and tax
consulting, due diligence procedures and help in preparing SEC
filings, according the company's proxy statement. Enron and
Andersen declined to provide further detail.

     Those fees were proportionately larger than some other
companies paid outside auditors. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest
oil company, with more than twice Enron's $100.1 billion of
revenue, paid 29 percent less to its auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Dynegy, which is also audited by
Andersen, paid $3.2 million for its audit and $4.1 million in
other fees. That is 86 percent less than Enron paid. Dynegy's
revenue of $29.5 billion was 71 percent less than Enron's.

                       Consulting Work

     John Coffee, Adolf A. Berle professor of law at Columbia
University Law School, said he is concerned about the $27 million
Enron paid Andersen for non-audit work. ``If you had an auditor
that wasn't trying to cross-sell other services with more profit
potential, would it have been as acquiescent?'' Coffee asked.

      Andersen's Tabolt defended the firm's consulting work for
Enron. ``We help improve the quality of financial reporting by
helping clients understand the accounting rules and how to apply
them,'' said Tabolt. ``In doing this, we follow the rules of the
profession and the SEC.''

     In the Waste Management and Sunbeam cases, shareholders and
the SEC alleged that Andersen allowed the companies to inflate
earnings and revenue. The firm agreed last week to pay $20
million to settle a malpractice lawsuit over its audit work for
Waste Management. Last June, Andersen agreed to pay a $7 million
civil fine, the largest ever imposed by the SEC against a Big-
Five accounting firm.

                        'Black Eyes'

     In April, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle a
securities fraud class action suit filed over its accounting work
for appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. The appliance maker filed for
bankruptcy protection in February.

     ``Andersen now has three black eyes in a row,'' said Coffee,
who addressed the National Institute on Class Actions of the
American Bar Association on Friday in San Francisco.  The group's
members are lawyers who have collected billions of dollars for
investors in securities fraud class action suits against public
companies.

     ``There's a beauty contest going on,'' said Coffee,
referring to meetings taking place at the conference. He said law
firms are courting some of Enron's institutional investors for
the right to represent them against the energy company and its
auditor.

     Andersen's Tabolt said the SEC hasn't notified the firm that
it is under investigation in connection with its work for Enron.

     Coffee expressed concern that SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt,
who took over the agency in August, may not be as aggressive
in pursuing accounting fraud as his predecessor, Arthur
Levitt. As a private lawyer, Pitt represented major
accounting firms.

     ``Anyone who violates the law, and I do mean anyone,
will be held to the same high standards the agency has
applied for nearly seven decades,'' said Pitt in an
interview. ``There are no special rules for any class of
violator.''  He declined to comment on Enron and Andersen
because of the agency's investigation.


Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update1)
2001-11-12 06:59 (New York)

Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update1)

     (Adds Enron share trading in Germany in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. Chairman Chuck
Watson said he's convinced Enron Corp.'s trading operations are
sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that
helped drive Enron's stock down 67 percent in three weeks as
``financial noise.''

     Dynegy agreed Friday to buy Enron for at least $23 billion,
including at least $8 billion in stock and $15 billion in assumed
debt. In an interview after the merger announcement, Watson and
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay discussed how the Houston-based
companies reached agreement less than three weeks after Enron's
shares began plunging.

     ``All the financial noise about the partnerships, maybe it
has damaged the Enron brand a bit,'' Watson said. ``But I'll tell
you what it hasn't impacted, and that's the high regard that the
industry places on'' Enron's trading business, he said.

     Enron last week restated earnings for four years to include
losses from three affiliated partnerships, reducing earnings by
$586 million.

     Six employees, out of Enron's 20,000, may have improperly
benefited from the partnerships, Lay said.

     ``I'm sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over
the edge in their dealings or transactions, but you can't be
absolutely protected from that in any business,'' he said.

                        Lost Effectiveness

     Lay didn't specify which six people he was referring to. He
removed Andrew Fastow, who helped set up and ran many of the
affiliated partnerships, as chief financial officer on Oct. 24. An
Enron securities filing says Fastow made more than $30 million off
two of the partnerships.

    Fastow ``had lost his effectiveness because of all the press
coverage'' on the affiliates, Lay said.

     Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing
director and a corporate counsel for an Enron division, also were
fired, Enron said in a corporate filing on Thursday. Former
employees Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager were in a
position to profit from partnerships, the filing said.

     ``You trust people, you accept their representations and
proposals,'' Lay said. ``Sometimes when you do that, you get
surprised and disappointed.''

      Both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to
approve the merger because the two companies own different types
of assets and won't dominate any market.

    ``There really isn't anything that lays on top of each
other,'' Watson said Friday night. ``We're not in the pipeline
business and they are. We're in the generation business, and
they're really not.''

     Dynegy shares rose 6.2 percent on Friday after terms of the
Enron purchase leaked to the press. Watson expects the acquisition
to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share, or 35 percent, to Dynegy's
2002 earnings. Enron is selling for $10.41 a share, one-fifth the
average price over the past 12 months.

     Enron stock climbed 96 cents to $9.59 in Germany as 54,497
shares traded.

                            Cash Crunch

     The rapid decline of Enron threatened to bankrupt the company
and disrupt energy markets. Enron handles an estimated one-quarter
of U.S. electricity and natural-gas trades. A falling credit
rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed
to back trades.

     As part of the purchase, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion.

     ``What we found when looked under the hood is that the core
of Enron was still there and working as well as ever,'' Watson
said. ``That business was pristine and had nothing to do with the
partnerships.''

     Dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late
October, when Watson called Lay to offer assistance with Enron's
growing financial crisis, the two men said. That led to a Saturday
morning meeting in Lay's kitchen.

     ``He even made me a breakfast roll,'' Watson said.
     ``He didn't eat it,'' Lay said.
     Lay said he won't be an active manager in the new company.
Watson said Friday that he and Lay hadn't discussed a severance
package.

     As head of Enron, Lay had refocused the Houston operator of
U.S. natural-gas pipelines on trading and international expansion,
boosting reported revenue 20-fold since 1995 to $100.8 billion
last year. He said he doesn't regret the strategy.

     ``Clearly, Enron has gotten involved in business that hasn't
turned out well,'' Lay said, pointing to money-losers Azurix Inc.,
created to supply water and build related projects around the
world, and NewPower Holdings Inc., a seller of electricity to
homes and small businesses. ``But you have to keep in mind, too,
that 12 years ago we weren't in the wholesale merchant (trading)
business. Today that's an incredibly valuable franchise.''

     The trading business, which accounts for about 97 percent of
Enron's revenue, buys electricity, gas and other commodities from
producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and
industrial customers. It also advises big business customers on
energy use and sells them gas and electricity.

                     Reassessing Steel, Lumber

     Watson said the new company will keep trading coal, gas,
power and petroleum products, and plans to expand by buying assets
and using them to develop trading. ``We'll just have to reassess
over time whether we stay in'' trading of steel, lumber and other
non-energy commodities, he said.

     Enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power Co.
in India, which is owed $64 million in overdue bills from a state
government agency that has refused to pay the power prices Enron
was promised in contracts.

     ``We have strong legal remedies and we're heading down the
path toward arbitration, but we'd still very much like to work out
a settlement with the government,'' Lay said. Potential buyers
have balked at Enron's $1 billion asking price for Dabhol.

     Neither man would comment on whether Dynegy plans to cut jobs
after the merger, or what will happen to the naming rights to
Enron Field. The Major League baseball stadium is home to the
Houston Astros, and Enron paid $100 million to have its name on
the ballpark.

     ``The name of the company is now Dynegy,'' Watson said.
     Dynegy's acquisition requires approval from U.S. securities,
antitrust and energy regulators. Watson expects soon to share
details of the new Dynegy with regulators from the European Union
and U.K., where Enron operates a trading desk and owns a water
company and two power plants.

     ``I don't know if we are required to do so, but we will talk
to them anyway,'' Watson said.

     ``We don't think there are going to be any problems,'' Lay
said.



Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Mull $500 Mln Enron Stake, Dow Says
2001-11-12 03:06 (New York)


     London, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and
Citigroup Inc. may invest $250 million each in Enron Corp., the
company they are advising in its agreed takeover by Dynegy Inc.,
to stop credit downgrades, Dow Jones Newswires reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.

     Dynegy agreed Friday to buy the largest energy trader for at
least $23 billion, including at least $8 billion in stock and $15
billion in assumed debt. Moody's Investors Service maintained an
investment grade rating on Enron after the two banks told the
credit agency they were mulling a $500 million investment,
bolstering the company's financial outlook, the paper said.

     Moody's decision removed the threat that a junk rating would
create a cash crunch by forcing Enron to repay early $3.3 billion
of bonds. Last month, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup gave Enron a $1
billion credit line, using the company's pipeline systems as
collateral, the paper said.

     The investment, which raises conflict of interest issues, may
take several weeks to complete, the paper said.
     Citibank and J.P. Morgan spokesmen declined to comment.
Moody's spokesman also wouldn't comment.

This Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) deal is anything but definitive. I=

I can't recall a deal with this many breakup provisions: pipelines going her=

To me it seems to be a bit of a charade. I don't think, personally, there is=
 anything at Enron besides one pipeline that will generate a couple of hundr=

The idea that Enron's traders and its trading desk are an asset is under hea=

On top of all of that is the possibility of massive antitrust action brought=

Go ahead, short Dynegy and go long Enron. Just make sure you have calls on D=
