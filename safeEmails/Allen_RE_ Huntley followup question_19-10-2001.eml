Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of =
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant contra=
cts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (=
Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to close on=
 a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used. =20

I

Phillip,

I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you closed=
?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems above or around =
the garage area to consider.

If you find something and it's faxable, please send  it to my fax at 281-858=
-1127.  Feel free to call first if you have any  comments.
