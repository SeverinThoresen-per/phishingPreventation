How do you  think Gore did his time in Viet Nam?
>
> AL GORE IN VIET  NAM
>? Having posted a little tickler in last week's Digest about Al  Gore's 141
>days in Vietnam," The Federalist Editorial Board was inundated  with
>inquiries
>from Vietnam? vets. Most went something like  this:
>
> "Gore claimed in his convention speech: 'I enlisted in the  Army because I
>knew if? I didn't go, someone else in the small town  of Carthage, Tennesse=
e
>would have to? go in my place.' Since he  wasn't KIA or wounded, how was it
>that his Army tour? was far  shorter than all the rest of us?"
>? Our astute veteran readers took  the bait!? Gore's campaign launched a
>multimillion-dollar ad  campaign this week to tell his "life story." The ad=
s
>will include  references? to his service" in Vietnam-however brief.  Gore
>spent
>less than five months of a? typical twelve-month  tour in Vietnam. He spent
>every minute of his "tour" as a "rear-echelon  __________" (call any combat
>veteran and they can complete that  phrase? for you). He was classified as =
a
>military journalist after  telling recruiters he was a newspaper trainee"
>(read "copy boy") for the  New York Times while a student at? Harvard. He w=
as
>assigned as a  non-combatant "information specialist" to the Army's 20th
>Engineers  Brigade headquarters at Bien Hoa military base near Saigon.
>? Gore's  immediate supervisor in Vietnam has confirmed that his  posting
>there
>came with explicit instructions to baby-sit him and  make sure he was never
>in
>any? danger. That fact  notwithstanding, Gore has claimed to the Washington
>Post that he was  "shot at" and "spent most of my time in the field."? He
>later told  the Baltimore? Sun that "[I] pulled my turn on the perimeter  a=
t
>night and walked through the elephant grass and I was fired upon." He  has
>since backed off these exaggerated claims.
>? On May 22,  1971, not five months into his "tour of duty," Gore was given
>special  dispensation and a one-way ticket home to attend divinity school  =
in
>Nashville. He dropped out of Vanderbilt shortly thereafter. As for the  sev=
en
>months cut from? Gore's tour of duty in Vietnam, we suppose  "someone else =
in
>the small town of? Carthage, Tennessee" had to  finish his tour "in his
>place."
>? If everyone sends the above  to 7 people, I am positive that we can do so=
me
>good for the  COUNTRY.
