Janie:

Here is a summary of the new structure that we discussed for Harbor. =20

1.  Each day we would call in our estimate of usage for the next day.  On=20
friday we would  call in our estimate for Sat - Mon.

2.  The desk would bill us ON USAGE, not on deliveries or ordered.

3.  EPMI would pay the mid point of Gas Daily.

4.  EPMI would pay a demand charge of $.025/MMBtu based on a max DQ of 20,00=
0=20
MMBtu/d times the number

Let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will try to close the deal wit=
h=20
the customer.  If you could call me back today that would be great.
