I have 9000 day.  Ellwood will be a secondary delivery point on my contract=20
so any deal would be best efforts.  I have a call in to National Fuel to fin=
d=20
out how they do their constraints.

That would help us out as it is in the same zone as the A06 gas we need for=20
CPA. How much do you have and is it through Mar01? We may try to flow a=20
little in Jan to see if it will go as we need reliable supply for CPA.

You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime.  I have gas on=20
National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary=20
basis.  Ellwood in Op 8, Market area 35, I think.

This trades around a CNG North plus.

Let me know one way or another, I'm just eager to learn.
