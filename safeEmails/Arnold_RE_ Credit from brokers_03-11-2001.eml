Understand.  Enron has been Man's biggest account for years and during that =
time we have paid them a lot in commissions.  They approached us on Wednesda=
y to try to increase the margin required, even though we were below the cred=
it threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5+ years ago=
=2E  I refused to agree to change the margin calculations.  It became clear =
that Man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given tha=
t Man is a relatively small shop.  I agreed to xpit some positions such that=
 they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account.  =
At the same time I told them I was transacting business as usual and if they=
 couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business I would clear somebody else=
 but that was a permanent decision for them to make.  Clear our business alw=
ays, or clear it never.  Paribas has stuck with us throughout and I intend t=
o clear the majority of future biz with Paribas.  I agreed during hours of p=
hone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursd=
ay, which we did, but the rest of the position would stay there.  They agree=
d.  We specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would s=
tay and we would work out those positions over time.  &!@$ them if they are =
trying to go back on that. =20

I am going to get a guarantee to Fimat today from Enron Corp with respect to=
 ENA trades.  We have never had to do this before but if I do not get it Fim=

Please keep this bad cash/credit situation confidential. =20
