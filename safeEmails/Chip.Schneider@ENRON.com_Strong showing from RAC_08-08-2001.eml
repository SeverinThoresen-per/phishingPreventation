Below is the list of volunteers for all of the RAC sites.  I also have addit=
ional information on there.  Please give me a call tomorrow on my cell if yo=
u need me 832-725-1174.  The plan right now is for us to go regardless of we=
ather.  However, I would leave it up to each individual to decide if they wa=
nt to participate.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Becky - you may want to send out one more reminder to your people.  You can =
copy all of the names from excel and paste into the TO: spot in Outlook.
