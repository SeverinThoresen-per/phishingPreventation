Craig,
=20
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citize=
n's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your opera=
tions group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your =
question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any qu=
estions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6=
038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirme=
d was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the =
end of July. =20

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find=
 any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of small=
er!! =20

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and=
 confirmed for October?=20
