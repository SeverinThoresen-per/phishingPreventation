As of 5:30 today, the EFM spot group had another record day.  123 loads, 288=
 transactions.

I talked to them this morning and reminded them that any value in the busine=
ss will disappear unless they continue to grow volumes.  They hit it out of =
the park.

If you get the chance to stop by tomorrow and let them know you are paying a=
ttention I think that would do a lot for morale.  Keeping up activity in thi=
s atmosphere is remarkable, and they deserve some recognition.  The only ups=
ide for them at this point is being sold and getting Enron back part or all =
of its investment.

thanks,

dan
