Last week, interviews were held at The University of Michigan for full time =
Analyst positions.   We really appreciate all of the interviewers and those =
of you that participated in the resume review meeting for helping with the p=
rocess.

First round interviews included 24 great candidates.  Second round interview=
s were narrowed down to 9 candidates.   As a result, we have extended an inv=
itation to the following 4 candidates to participate in the "Fab Friday" (fo=
rmerly known as Super Saturday) event being held on the weekend of November =
15th.

Anand Kesavan			734-730-1025
Raj Mangalick				734-657-7227
Apratim Sen				734-657-5365
Denis Smirnov			734-222-0456

Since cultivation is an intricate part of the recruiting process, the follow=
ing  team members have been chosen to contact the following candidates to an=
swer any questions they might have about Fab Friday's.  Most of the assigned=
 team members have recently experienced Super Saturday's.


Team Member				Candidate
Ravi Mujumdar				Anand Kesavan=09
David Junus					Raj Mangalick
Kristin Quinn					Apratim Sen
Eric Irani					Denis Smirnov



As always, everyone is encouraged to cultivate those candidates invited to F=
ab Friday.


Thanks
