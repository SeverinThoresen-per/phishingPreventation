?I could see the Twin Towers burning from my office window in=20
Brooklyn.

?When I saw the second tower fall, all I could think of was my son=20
in daycare a few blocks from there.  Fortunately, I found he was=20
safe.  Our home is two blocks from Ground Zero.  We couldn?t get=20
back in for five weeks.  The Red Cross was a safe haven.  When I=20
talked about my fears and concerns, they listened.  I felt truly=20
cared for.?

Pamela Weadick, New York City

September 11, 2001 forever changed the landscape of our country and=20
the life of every American. We have never faced a disaster of this=20
size, scope or intensity but we?re meeting the challenge.=20
Conversely, we have never before received such overwhelming support=20
from the public. Americans like you have responded with an=20
outpouring of love, labor, blood and generosity. The American Red=20
Cross depends solely on voluntary donations of time, money and=20
blood. Without donations from you and others, we would not be able=20
to carry out our humanitarian mission.

America has spoken loudly and clearly.  The Red Cross is honoring=20
the national call for relief efforts to be directed solely toward=20
the people affected by the September 11 tragedies.  The immediate=20
and long-term needs of the people affected by the terrorist attacks=20
are our highest priority.  We?re moving more money to the families=20
of the dead and seriously injured victims quickly by extending our=20
Family Gift Program to cover a full year of living expenses,=20
providing additional payments for the next 6 months based on need.

25,000 families already have been directly helped by the American=20
Red Cross. Through your support of our disaster response efforts,=20
millions of meals have been served, tens of thousands of people have=20
received mental health and grief counseling, and millions of dollars=20
have been dispensed to families in dire need to cover costs of=20
transportation, childcare, mortgage or rent payments, funerals and=20
related expenses. Thousands of people have been displaced from their=20
homes, and the Red Cross is there offering funds for groceries,=20
lodging, clean-up and recovery. More than 45,000 Red Cross=20
volunteers and disaster workers have worked at Ground Zero where=20
they have been caring for construction workers, police, fire=20
personnel and emergency medical technicians.

The American Red Cross will spend $275 million in support of people=20
affected by the disasters by year end, about half of the $542=20
million that has been received to date.  We continue to assess the=20
needs of those affected by these tragedies and will offer families=20
even more assistance in the months ahead.

The Red Cross was the first organization to give such support and=20
has provided more cash assistance to the families and dependents of=20
loved ones lost in the September 11 attacks than all other major=20
humanitarian service organizations combined. The Red Cross will help=20
with recovery efforts throughout the weeks, months and years to come=20
? for as long as needs exist.
