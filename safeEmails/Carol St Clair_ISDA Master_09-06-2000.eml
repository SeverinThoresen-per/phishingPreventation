Rob:
I received the documents and Susan Flynn will get them executed along with=20
the Enron Guaranty and the other certificates and get them back to you next=20
week.  My question for you is when you consider the agreement to be effectiv=
e=20
for trading purposes?  I'm assuming you want to wait for the Enron Guaranty=20
and that any trades done before the Guaranty is sent to you would not be=20
confirmed under the Master.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.  I=20
have asked Enron's counsel to process the Guaranty ASAP.  Thanks.
Carol=20
