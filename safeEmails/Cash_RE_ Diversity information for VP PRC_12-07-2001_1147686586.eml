I'd check with Oxley first.  I kind of think they are separate issues, and I=
 am not sure that the whole group needs to see the areas where we may have i=
ssues.  MHC

Meeting is on 23 July.  I would probably do it within the meeting, because t=
hat is probably the only time we'll get the committee together in one place.=
  Shall I pass this alterative through Delainey?

I like that better.  When is that meeting?  Or, do we want to do that separa=
tely outside of the PRC evaluation meeting?

I don't think that is a good idea.

We were intending to put these results (which would actually be preliminary =
and based on the prerating results for VP's) into the VP data books.   =20

Who will get them?  I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversa=
tion and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect =
the privilege.  Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is n=
o protection if we find undesirable results.=20

Hi Michelle;
=20
Dovie told me that she has had a chat with you regarding the diversity stats=
 we were preparing for the VP PRC on 23 July.  Delainey had asked specifical=
ly for these stats, and that's why wewere including them.  Is there any way =
that we can provide the data, perhaps marking it attny privilidge?  If not, =
can we discuss this with Delainey so that he is aware of the reasons PEP PRC=
 cannot provide it?  I'd apprecuate your thoughts.  Thanks, Gina
