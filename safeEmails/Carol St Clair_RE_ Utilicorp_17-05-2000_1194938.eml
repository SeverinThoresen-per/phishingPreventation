I agree with you.  I had thought about waiting to execute the Transfer
Agreement until after we had executed the new ISDA and (and thus were doing
all subsequent trades as UtiliCorp) and dating the Transfer Agreement
accordingly.  I think it is a more legally sound way of handling the whole
issue.  Why don't you wait until I send you the fully executed ISDA and we
have the correct name in your Enron Online database, and then redate and
send the Transfer Agreement?
