Hey Gerald,

Enron Corp. and Texaco Inc. currently have issued $12MM guaranties to=20
Superior Natural Gas.  The obligations under the guaranties are several and=20
not joint obligations.  The customer has asked that we increase these=20
guaranties to $25MM.  Please prepare an amendment to the existing guaranties=
=20
and have Enron execute a hardcopy original, delivering such copy to me at=20
2860b.  And, drafting an executable Texaco copy so that I might e-mail the=20
request to Texaco for signature.

Thanks for your help.
