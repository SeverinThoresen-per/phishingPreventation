Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do=20
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set=
=20
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp=
=20
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait=20
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my=
=20
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password=20
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set=
=20
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that h=
e=20
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those=
=20
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for th=
e=20
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from=
=20
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change an=
d=20
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is=20
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but=20
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you=20
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.
Carol
