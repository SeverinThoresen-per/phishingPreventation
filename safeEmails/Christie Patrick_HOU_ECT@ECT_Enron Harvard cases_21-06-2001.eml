Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron case=
s he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec =
Ed program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris =
called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that=
 the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and ve=
ry 'pro-Enron'!

Best!

--Christie.
