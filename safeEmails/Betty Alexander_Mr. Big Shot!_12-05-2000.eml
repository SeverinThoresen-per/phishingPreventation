Vince -
I couldn't have been more pleased than when I saw your name on the Managing=20
Director promotion list last January - who says nice guys finish last! =20

I've had the announcement in my "to do" folder all this time, waiting for me=
=20
to catch up enough to send you this message, but I guess you're no stranger=20
to that scenario....

Nothing stochastic about it, you're simply the best!

Betty  :)
