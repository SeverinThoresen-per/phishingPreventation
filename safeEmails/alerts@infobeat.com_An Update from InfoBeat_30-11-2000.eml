Dear Valued InfoBeat Subscriber:

We sincerely apologize for any service disruption or inconvenience

situations from occurring in the future.  We very much appreciate=20
your continued patience as we make some final enhancements which,=20
when completed, will result in an InfoBeat service that is better=20
than ever.

Thank you for your continued support which has helped InfoBeat grow=20
to be a service with over 8 million subscribers, each receiving=20
personalized news every day.  We greatly appreciate your patience=20
as we finish our upgrades that will make InfoBeat even better for=20
every one of you. =20
