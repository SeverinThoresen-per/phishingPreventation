Yes, I believe we will.  It is a $1000 penalty -- ridiculous.  We will oppos=
e the concept of a penalty in general, as well as the amount, which seems ve=
ry arbitrary.  We are also requesting, in a separate proceeding, a moratoriu=
m on tariff filings by MISO until the Midwest RTO process has progressed suf=
ficiently to allow meaningful consideration of the tariff.
I am not sure who is doing the writing but we'll run a draft by you. =20

I hope that we are planning to contest this proposed amendment.
