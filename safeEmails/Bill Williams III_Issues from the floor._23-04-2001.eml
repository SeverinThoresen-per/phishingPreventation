Group,
Two quick things...

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta,=20
Arco, Tosco, etc. we need to be sure to schedule using the customer ID in=20
CAPS.  Otherwise RT has no generation and we are considered short (please se=
e=20
myself or Kourtney with questions).


Second- from the preschedulers:
If we sit at Lisa or Stacy's desk, please be sure to log out of the computer=
=20
and their phone.   Their computers are not necessarily for Real-Time use, =20
but I would like to be sure that we can continue to use these computers at=20
night.  If they aren't happy with the cleanliness of their desk, or with=20
having to reset their computers each morning, etc...we will probably lose=20
this priviledge.

Other than that,=20

Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
Bill
