#1- Was supposed to be a "meat haul"...not a trophy hunt.
#2- Landing nets are for boats.
#3- The thrill of avoiding a "barbing" by one of the many treble hooks conne=
cted to typical plugs intensifies the experience. See Zander experience in t=
he surf.
#4- CCA gets plenty of my money already...see Chad and I at Crawfish Boil.
#5- Addendum to item #2: Landing nets are for old people. Or fags.
