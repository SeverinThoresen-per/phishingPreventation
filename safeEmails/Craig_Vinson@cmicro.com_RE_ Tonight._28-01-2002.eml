Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon=
 again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at w=
ork or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face=
 again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad =
either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

CF
