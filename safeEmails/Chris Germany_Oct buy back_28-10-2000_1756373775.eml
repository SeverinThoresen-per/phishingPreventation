Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New=20
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New=20
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the=20
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through=20
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.
