PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Here's an update (Matt, if any of this appears inaccurate to you, don't=20
hesitate to point it out):

1.  The pending joint survey.

 (a) The joint survey has yet to be scheduled.  The reason for the delay is=20
an issue concerning whether SGS's Singapore laboratory has the=20
resources/competence to carry out the joint analysis.  Steve Jones, ECT's=20
choice of chemist, is communicating with SGS in order to make this=20
determination.  Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing, Jone=
s=20
feels strongly that it will be most cost-effective for ECT to proceed with a=
=20
joint analysis only after making this determination.  I (and Matt) have=20
personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT=20
is looking for the quickest, most cost-effective resolution to this dispute=20
with Mitsubishi.  Because of the issue with SGS, Jones has waited until now=20
to send the proposed testing program to Technichem, Mitsubishi's choice of=20
surveyor/chemist  (in a previous report, I mentioned that the testing progra=
m=20
had already been sent to Technichem; this now turns out not to be the case).=
 =20
By today, Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem,=
=20
in order to get the ball rolling, and with the expectation that Technichem=20
will have comments that will require time to incorporate. =20

 (b) If things go well with SGS, Jones anticipates scheduling a joint=20
analysis about two-three weeks from now.  Jones plan to personally attend th=
e=20
joint survey on our behalf, given the complexity of the testing methods. =20
Even after that testing, Jones anticipates the possibility of further testin=
g=20
in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the=20
apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessel's=
=20
inert gas system.

2. Costs. =20

 (a)  Surveyors/chemists:

 (1) Jones advises that to date, he and his firm have spent a total of about=
=20
5.5 days at 720 pounds per day, for a total of approximately 3,960 pounds, o=
r=20
roughly $5,742 at the current USD/pounds exchange rate of $1.45/1 pound. =20
Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard, now with ITS-Cale=
b=20
Brett, who specializes in the type of testing at issue.  Jones estimates tha=
t=20
Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter, at a daily rate of=20
600 lbs, or $870.
=20
 (2)  Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey=20
begins, he will spend about two more days, and Goddard will spend about=20
another one-half day.  This totals about 1,740 pounds, or $2,523.

 (3)   For the actual joint testing, Jones estimates that he will spend abou=
t=20
twelve days straight, including transit time; Goddard would not attend, but=20
would be available by telephone if Jones had a question.  Twelve days' time=20
amounts to 8,640 pounds, or $12,528, not including aire fare, room and board=
=2E

 (4)  Afterwards, for the additional testing in England to determine whether=
=20
the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt, Jones estimates=20
another 2,000 pounds for the cost of the lab; he does not know at this point=
=20
whether he would attend the entire testing procedure, which he believes coul=
d=20
be=20
completed in about two days.  If he attended both days, this additional=20
testing in England would run to another 3,440 pounds, or $4,988.

 (b) Other experts:
=20
 (1) SGS and Caleb Brett's costs to date are being compiled by Matt.  SGS=20
will spend another SGD 2,000 purchasing the necessary chemicals for the join=
t=20
testing, and bill for another SGD 2,000 for pre-joint-analysis development=20
work (basically, practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO).  This=20
comes to a total of SGD 4,000, or  about $2,325 to prepare for the joint=20
analysis, based on the current reported SGD/USD exchange rate of 1.72/1.  SG=
S=20
estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD 9,500, or about=20
$5,523.

 (2) Captain Sawant of PacMarine, one of our ship operations experts, will b=
e=20
charging us SGD 25,000, or about $14,500  for work done to date, which shoul=
d=20
be largely concluded with the finalization of his report. =20

 (3)  Captain Gregory of Noble Denton, the ship operation expert we would=20
probably use for testifying, has been asked to do no work on this matter at=20
this time.=20

 (c) Attorneys:

 (1) David Best is out of town on vacation, but his office advises that his=20
time and expenses to date amounts to approximately 8,300 pounds, or about=20
$12,035.  This is subject to being adjusted up or down, once Best gets back=20
in the office and has time to review the bill.  I imagine that this bill doe=
s=20
not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on=20
the FGH issue.  Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend th=
e=20
joint testing.

 (2) Neale Gregson's firm, Watson, Farley, has incurred fees and expense to=20
date of SGD 105,000, or about $61,000.  Matt has not yet seen an itemized=20
bill for this time, but feels that while it is high, it is not unexpected,=20
given the time-intensive nature of this matter.  Matt will be asking Gregson=
=20
whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter.
=20
 (3) My and my legal assistant's fee and expenses through today amount to=20
approximately $12,500.  This also includes time spent on the FGH matter,=20
although, pursuant to Alan's instructions, I am no longer spending time on=20
that matter, except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised.=20

 (d) Summary of Costs.

 In sum, no less than approximately $106,000 has been spent to date, and thi=
s=20
figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date, and=20
once David Best comes back from vacation on September 11 and reviews his bil=
l=20
(although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on th=
e=20
FGH matter).  Another $5,325 will be necessary to get ready for the joint=20
analysis; another $18,000 to perform the joint analysis in Singapore, and=20
another approximately $5,000 to perform specialized testing in London after=20
the joint analysis is done (if Steve Jones determines that such further=20
testing is necessary).

3.  Recent Sale of Thailand cargo. =20

 (a) You will recall that the bulk of the product from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO=
=20
was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to=20
FGH, given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines=
,=20
which was tendered to FGH, who rejected it.  Samples from the shore tanks in=
=20
Thailand have recently been tested by SGS's laboratory in the U.S. and=20
reportedly found on spec.  All of the Thailand product has recently been sol=
d=20
to Caltex, Singapore, for delivery September 7-9, reportedly for use in=20
Caltex's refinery, which makes the risk of rejection of that product by=20
Caltex very low. =20

 (b) Unfortunately, Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a=20
ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of=
=20
the month, given that the price is tied to some market index.  Lacking this,=
=20
it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the=20
Elang crude ECT has sustained until then.  We were previously told that the=20
product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of=20
about $288,000.  For my own purposes, based on nothing more than speculation=
,=20
and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand, I am using=20
the working hypothesis that ECT's total damages for diminution of market=20
value of all the product discharged from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO is in the=20
range of $600,000-$750,000.  Again, this may later turn out to be very=20
inaccurate.      =20

4.  Expert witness supplemental opinion

  At my request, Captain Sawant, our consulting expert on ship operations,=20
was asked whether he believed that ECT's instructions to the ship regarding=20
tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination=
=20
that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out (i.e., if the=20
ship had access to fresh water).  Captain Sawant has opined that he does not=
=20
believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of=20
contamination that occurred.   While we can protect Captain Sawant's opinion=
=20
from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert, it strikes me that=20
Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue.  Despite this, however, ECT=20
still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a=20
non-delegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi.
