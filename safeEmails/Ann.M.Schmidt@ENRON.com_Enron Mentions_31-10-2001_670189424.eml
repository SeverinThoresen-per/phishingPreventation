With growing revenue, a dominant position in major energy-trading markets an=
d a depressed stock price, Enron Corp. would logically be prime takeover bai=
t. But in the topsy-turvy world of Enron, what constitutes logic anymore?=20
Takeover speculation has swirled around Wall Street and the energy markets i=
n recent days as Enron shares have plummeted by about two-thirds to their lo=
west level in a decade, a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence i=
n the Houston energy-trading company following big third-quarter write-downs=
 and the disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into tra=
nsactions involving its former chief financial officer. Among the names band=
ied about as potential buyers of all or at least a substantial chunk of Enro=
n are General Electric's GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathawa=
y and Royal Dutch Shell. GE and Berkshire had no comment. A spokesman for Sh=
ell couldn't be reached.
Meanwhile, Enron has approached at least one major institutional investor, s=
eeking a capital infusion, according to a person familiar with the matter. B=
ut Enron was turned down because of uncertainties over its financial conditi=
on, this person says.=20
While Enron shares, which are trading at about book value, look cheap by his=
torical standards and even compared with two weeks ago, it isn't clear wheth=
er history is much guide when evaluating Enron these days, say analysts and =
others. Even fans of the stock have long complained about difficulty underst=
anding how Enron operates because of its enormously complex financial struct=
ure and relatively sparse disclosure. For years while Enron's stock price wa=
s soaring, much of Wall Street didn't seem to care about such issues.=20
Now with Enron's stock dropping, that lack of understanding is haunting the =
company. "How bad could Enron get? That's really the question," says Prudent=
ial Securities analyst Carole Coale. Yesterday, Ms. Coale reduced her price =
target for Enron shares to $9 and maintained the "sell" recommendation she r=
ecently put on the stock. At 4 p.m. yesterday in New York Stock Exchange com=
posite trading, Enron shares were down $2.65, or 19%, to $11.16, down from n=
early $85 a year ago.=20
"When a business like this starts a down cycle, they've got to stop it and s=
tabilize before anyone will be willing to have a really intelligent conversa=
tion with them," says Peter J. Solomon, head of Peter J. Solomon Co., an inv=
estment-banking boutique.=20
An Enron spokesman says the company won't comment on takeover speculation; n=
or will it comment on whether it had approached potential investors about a =
possible capital infusion. However, the continued plunge in Enron shares and=
 turmoil surrounding the company are a significant "overreaction in the mark=
etplace. Our core businesses are strong," he says. The company has said that=
 it is taking steps to restore investor confidence.=20
For example, Enron is trying to negotiate a new credit line with its major b=
anks. Late yesterday, Enron's bankers were putting the final touches on a ne=
w credit line of more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the=
 discussions.=20
Analysts and other observers say that one uncertainty surrounding Enron is t=
he condition of its vast energy-trading operation. As the nation's biggest e=
nergy trader, Enron is a principal in one-quarter of all electricity and nat=
ural-gas trades. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has tra=
nsacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 19=
99 and does about $4 billion a day in transactions.=20
One worry is that Enron's trading partners, edgy about the turmoil swirling =
around the company, will start demanding much tougher credit terms from the =
Houston company or simply cut back doing business. Such a trend, if it picke=
d up enough momentum, could have troubling consequences for Enron. "We are a=
ll in suspense . . . . It all depends on how the market reacts," says Susan =
Abbott, a managing director at Moody's Investors Service. On Monday, Moody's=
 downgraded Enron's long-term debt.=20
There were some warning signs of unease among trading partners even before t=
he company's third-quarter earnings release set the stage for the huge drop =
in the stock price. About six to seven weeks ago, Entergy Corp. became worri=
ed about its level of exposure in Enron-related deals, says Wayne Leonard, c=
hairman and chief executive officer of the big New Orleans energy company. S=
ince then, Entergy has cut its Enron exposure to about $10 million to $20 mi=
llion from $90 million to $100 million, he says. Mr. Leonard didn't specify =
what prompted the worries, which appear to have arisen after the surprise Au=
gust announcement by Jeffrey Skilling that he was resigning as Enron preside=
nt and chief executive. Mr. Skilling cited personal reasons as well as his c=
oncerns over the falling stock price.=20
While the Enron spokesman says the company doesn't comment on specific tradi=
ng arrangements, he adds that Entergy is one of his company's smaller tradin=
g partners. He says major trading partners are doing business with Enron on =
"essentially the same terms and conditions" and that overall "our trading op=
erations are as strong as ever."=20
The company spokesman adds that a few smaller trading partners in Europe are=
 seeking revised credit terms from Enron. "We are working to put together cr=
edit terms, which they are more comfortable with," says the spokesman, who d=
eclines to be more specific.=20
In an effort to bolster its liquidity and position in the marketplace, Enron=
 last week drew down some $3 billion, accounting for the bulk of its existin=
g credit lines. While it used most of that money to buy its outstanding comm=
ercial paper, a short-term corporate IOU, the company retained about $1 bill=
ion of the borrowings as cash.=20
A friendly takeover of all or part of Enron would be likelier than a hostile=
 one. Among the most obvious candidates would be other companies with big tr=
ading operations and experience in risk management. Two possible deterrents =
to a would-be buyer: a flurry of recent shareholder lawsuits filed against E=
nron and the continuing SEC probe.=20

STOCK MARKETS LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE - Shell hurt by Enron bid talk.
By PETER JOHN, PATRICK LORD and RUTH SULLIVAN.

10/31/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Shell Transport underperformed BP on speculation that it might be poised to =
launch a multi-billion dollar bid for Enron of the US.=20
The company is believed to have been in talks with the indebted energy group=
 earlier in the year.
Enron has a market capitalisation of around $11bn. Analysts say Shell would =
probably not have to offer a huge premium and could afford to fund a deal wi=
th cash. Shell said it would not comment on the speculation.=20
Enron would be a good fit but earlier this week Moody's became the first of =
the main rating agencies to downgrade the Houston-based company's debt by lo=
wering it to just two notches above "junk" status citing "the deterioration =
in Enron's financial flexibility".=20
Steve Turner of Commerzbank said: "I think the market would be very nervous =
if Shell were to launch a bid for Enron because of the uncertainty about Enr=
on's balance sheet."=20
There was another judder to the share price from speculation that Moeara Eni=
m, an investment vehicle whose sole asset is a 55m share stake in Royal Dutc=
h, faces a bid and break up by Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial group. Sh=
ell fell 14 1/2 to 515p and BP dropped 6 1/2 to 553 1/2p.=20
Vodafone accounted for 20 per cent of the Footsie fall after the mobile phon=
e group, which has rallied sharply since September 11, came off the boil.=20
The shares dropped 5 1/2 to 157 3/4p on turnover of 435m shares, almost 22 p=
er cent of the total traded across the UK market.=20
The shares had rallied 26 per cent over the past six weeks and several broke=
rs had started to call the top. The latest to downgrade was Commerzbank whic=
h moved its stance to "reduce" from "hold" with a fair value estimate of 149=
p a share.=20
The broker's move reflected worries that Vodafone's recent revenue per user =
figures were not sufficient to bolster confidence in forecasts of longer-ter=
m sustained customer revenue growth.=20
Colt profits taken=20
Elsewhere in the sector, Colt Telecom fell 15 1/4 to 121 3/4p as investors t=
ook profits and Merrill Lynch downgraded estimates.=20
Merrill said that after Colt's recent disappointing third quarter results, i=
t had cut its revenue forecasts for 2001 and 2002 by 1 per cent and 5 per ce=
nt respectively.=20
Colt had jumped more than 12 per cent on Monday on talk that Cable & Wireles=
s might launch a bid.=20
3i fell 60 to 730p after an early release of the group's interim results sho=
wed that net asset value per share had slid 22.6 per cent to 631p. The compa=
ny said it had decided on an early release of its results as it was also ann=
ouncing organisational changes. It said it was cutting 17 per cent of its wo=
rkforce in an effort to maintain a strong balance sheet amid poor market con=
ditions.=20
Close Brothers fell 37 to 715p as the merchant bank said it remained cautiou=
s about the outlook.=20
London Bridge Software fell 12 to 129 1/2p as Nomura downgraded its rating a=
nd forecasts to reflect the group's high level of US exposure.=20
Spirent fell another 11 to 116 1/2p as Deutsche Bank became the latest broke=
r to issue cautious advice. It started coverage of the communications testin=
g group with a "market perform" stance, saying near-term sector risks outwei=
ghed the long-term prospects.=20
Medisys gained 7 to 62 1/2p after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein initiated c=
overage on the stock with a "buy" recommendation.=20
Shares in GKN fell 9 to 271p after the automotive and aerospace engineer ann=
ounced that it is to shed 1,250 jobs - including some in the UK. The cuts ar=
e likely to be concentrated in the civil aerospace area which has suffered h=
eavily. Credit Suisse First Boston cut its profit forecasts for the next two=
 years.=20
Bullough, the engineering holding company, said any improvement in trading i=
n the second half is unlikely. Its shares fell 3 1/2 to 18p.=20
British American Tobacco brought some cheer to the FTSE 100 as its shares ro=
se 11 1/2 or almost 2 per cent to 597 1/2p after the company said its four g=
lobal brands showed an overall growth rate of 9 per cent and reported robust=
 nine month results.=20
BAT on the rise=20
Michael Smith, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said third quarter r=
esults were "slightly better than expected" and showed that BAT can meet its=
 numbers for the full year.=20
"It can achieve 8 per cent earnings growth for the full year" he said. But a=
lthough there was plenty of reassurance for this year, next year will be mor=
e of a challenge. "Weak macro-economic conditions and smokers downtrading to=
 cheaper brands are likely to prove a problem next year," he said. Another c=
oncern will be countries such as Germany and Malaysia where tax on cigarette=
s is increasing.=20
Some of the fizz went out of alcoholic drinks groups as two leading companie=
s in the sector made cautious comments about future growth prospects after t=
he September 11 terrorist attacks on the US. Despite reporting robust full-y=
ear results, Allied Domecq shares fell 11 to 351 1/2p as the group warned th=
at future earnings growth will be harder to achieve than last year.=20
Merrill Lynch said that trading profit was 2 per cent ahead of estimates at =
#543m, against the broker's forecast of #530m but Merrill analyst Mark Pulei=
kis said there will be two hits to profits going forward.=20
"Allied will spend #50m on IT over the next few years and a further de-stock=
ing programme of #15m per annum over the next two years," he said. The broke=
r gave a discounted cash flow forecast of 460p and retained its "neutral" re=
commendation. The broker said it continued to prefer Diageo.=20
ABN Amro also retained its "hold" stance.=20
Leisure and hotel group Whitbread gained 7 1/2 to 520p after reporting a 32 =
per cent drop in first half profits, in line with analysts expectations. ABN=
 Amro said it anticipates about a 5 per cent upgrade to its profit before ta=

Waiting for Balance Sheets Amid Enron's Debacle: David Wilson
2001-10-31 06:19 (New York)

Waiting for Balance Sheets Amid Enron's Debacle: David Wilson

     (Commentary. David Wilson is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- International
Business Machines Corp.'s press release about its third-quarter
results included this statement, attributed to Louis Gerstner,
chairman and chief executive officer:

     ``IBM's balance sheet remains among the strongest in the
technology industry, or any industry.''

     The largest maker of computers and provider of computer
services wasn't the only company to cite its balance sheet, a
statistical summary of what a company owned, what it owed, and
what was left over for shareholders on a specific date.

     General Electric Co., the largest company by stock market
value, and Citigroup Inc., the No. 1 financial-services company,
made similar references in their third-quarter releases.

     None of the companies really showed people what they were
telling them. IBM, General Electric and Citigroup are among 19
members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average whose most recent
quarterly releases didn't include balance sheets.

     The evidence will come only when the companies submit their
quarterly reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Balance sheets are required in the so-called 10-Q filings, along
with the 10-K filings that cover the full year.

                        Not Much Publicity

     By then, statistics about the companies' assets, liabilities
and shareholders' equity, the accounting terms for what's owned,
what's owed and what's left over, will be rather outdated.

     U.S. companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter
to submit 10-Q reports, and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year
for 10-K reports.

     These filings usually don't arrive until weeks after the
publication of earnings releases. So it's easy to overlook the
additional information they provide, especially when it doesn't
receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does.

     Yet the recent example of Enron Corp. -- another company that
omits balance sheets from press releases -- provides evidence that
investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at
their own peril.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, reported $1.01 billion in
``non-recurring'' costs in the third quarter from an expansion
into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales. The
expense contributed to a $618 million loss for the quarter.

     These numbers were part of the Houston-based company's income
statement, a summary of sales, costs and expenses, and profits or
losses during a specified time period. Income statements are the
cornerstone of any company's earnings release.

                      Billion-Dollar Numbers

     The release didn't even mention a larger figure that affected
the balance sheet: a $1.2 billion drop in shareholders' equity
during the quarter. Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay disclosed the
repurchase in a subsequent conference call.

     This decline resulted from the company's repurchase of 55
million shares from two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-
Investment LP, that helped finance projects. Andrew Fastow, who
ran both partnerships, was ousted from his job as chief financial
officer last week.

     Such a one-two punch dealt a blow to investors' fortunes.
Since Oct. 17, the day after the earnings release, Enron's shares
have fallen each day and have lost two-thirds of their value. The
low of $10.90 yesterday was the lowest price since July 1992.

     Enron's third-quarter statement referred only to a loss on
``finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity'' which
contributed to $544 million of investment losses. The size of that
item was later put at $35 million.

     The latter number amounts to just 3.5 percent of the overall
figure for ``non-recurring'' costs, and less than 1 percent of the
company's $47.6 billion in revenue for the quarter.

                        Growing Debt Burden

     The $1.2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in
dollars, but also in percentage terms. Enron had $11.74 billion of
shareholders' equity as of June 30, according to the balance sheet
in its second-quarter 10-Q filing. The reduction equaled more than
10 percent of that total.

     Among other things, the balance sheet also shows that the
company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year's
first half. Short-term debt, due in one year or less, doubled to
$3.46 billion. Long-term debt, maturing in more than one year,
rose 9.4 percent to $9.36 billion.

     There's even more to the story of Enron's indebtedness. The
company guaranteed $3.3 billion in borrowing by Osprey Trust and
Marlin Water Trust, which bought some of its power plants. Unless
they pay off the debt by reselling the plants, the company may
have to come up with the difference.

     Nevertheless, any summary of a company's financial position
provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone.
This also holds true for companies whose finances are in better
shape -- IBM, General Electric and Citigroup, to name three.

                        Knowing by Showing

     Other members of the Dow industrials that wait until their
filings to provide balance sheets are American Express Co., AT&T
Corp., Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Walt Disney
Co., DuPont Co., Eastman Kodak Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., General
Motors Corp., Honeywell International Inc., Johnson & Johnson,
McDonald's Corp., Merck & Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and SBC
Communications Inc.

     Companies that include them in releases are Alcoa Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Home Depot Inc., Intel Corp., International
Paper Co., Microsoft Corp., Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.,
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Philip Morris Cos., United Technologies
Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

     Citigroup's third-quarter earnings release has this quote
from Sandy Weill, chairman and CEO: ``We have the balance sheet
strength to make timely acquisitions to expand our franchises.''
The New York-based company had more than $85 billion of ``total
equity,'' Weill said in the statement.

     General Electric's release quoted Chairman and CEO Jeffrey
Immelt as saying ``our strong balance sheet, which gives us the
flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities,'' is one of the
Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's ``fundamental strengths.''

     Investors can only take these CEOs at their word for now.
Their companies, and many others, are only telling rather than
showing -- at least in their earnings releases.

 small-cap and large growth stocks turned into small value plays, we have se=
en mutual fund families fall by the wayside as they weren't able to dodge th=
e quickly changing market.=20
We tend to want to believe that it is just stock selection that sunk a First=
 Hands or a Janus or an Invesco or a Van Wagoner or those ne'er-do-well Putn=
am funds.=20
But it's not. It's also trading. Many of the funds that gained great renown =
in the 1990s that have now fallen on such hard times since the bear market b=
egan in 2000 are funds that don't know how to sell, that don't know how to g=
et out of stocks.=20
You won't read this kind of criticism in the mutual fund ratings, which tend=
 to be antiseptic and mathematically derived. And you won't read it in the m=
agazines like Money or the SmartMoney, outlets that, while strong in some de=
partments, really don't understand trading at all.=20
But it is what determines good from bad in tough markets, and right now you =
are seeing some really horrible trading from some of these giant mutual fund=
s. They are simply unable to extricate themselves from loser positions witho=
ut hurting themselves on the go out.=20
Trading's an art. For those of you who are football fans, trading is like wh=
at happens in the interior line, the trenches. You know that's where the gam=
e can be decided. Basketball fans? Trading is the movement of other players =
who don't have the ball. It is the invisible game that determines what is go=
ing to happen.=20
I take it seriously because I was a trader and most of my friends are trader=
s. We will often joke about how some of these mutual funds just don't have a=
 clue when they are trying to get out of stocks. They blow them to kingdom c=
ome with their sloppiness and their inability to execute.=20
Others, however, can trade magnificently and know how to play the game. Have=
 you noticed, for example, I never make fun of Fidelity in my litany of fund=
 criticism? One of the reasons is that Fidelity is a fabulous trader. FIDO h=
as a great trading desk that is incredibly adept at getting in and out of st=
ocks. They are masters. It saves their portfolio managers' fortunes. I know =
this because I have handled their orders and because I have many friends who=
 currently handle their orders and we all talk, as we always have, about thi=
s stuff every day.=20
When we look at sagas like Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , where mutu=
al funds were caught trying to exit, caught like trapped deer on an intersta=
te, we have to remember that not all mutual fund trading desks are created e=
qually. Some simply don't have a clue.=20
Getting out of stock, especially when you have built up a huge concentration=
 in one position, is an art, an art that many funds of the world never had. =
They even denigrated the profession by never emphasizing it as a virtue. In =
these days when the market blitzes positions it doesn't like, if you don't h=
ave a good trading line, you could be history.=20
Many of these mutual fund "families" will turn out to be history when this e=
ra ends. Don't let them make your nest egg history, too. Especially when the=
re are other fund groups that do know the value of good trading and can hand=
le these markets with much more poise and far fewer losses.=20
Random musings: Pit yourself against others and make money in our trading co=
ntest. And create a record to show others that you know how to trade so you =
can catch on with or create your own hedge fund! That's what this contest is=

S&P Analyst Todd Shipman on Enron Corp.: Credit Rating Comment
2001-10-31 08:18 (New York)


     New York, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Todd Shipman, a director at
Standard & Poor's, a credit rating company, comments on Enron
Corp, the Houston-based largest energy trader.

     S&P affirmed the company's long-term credit rating at
``BBB+'' on Oct. 25. It lowered its outlook to negative from
stable following the announcement that the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission is investigating the company's financial
dealings with affiliates that were run by ousted Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     Enron's shares have fallen 87 percent this year. They
finished yesterday down $2.65, or 19 percent, to $11.16.

     ``What little bit of credibility management had with
investors has continued to erode,'' he said.

     ``People, I don't believe, are acting based on facts that are
coming out.'' They are trading on the ``uncertainty as to what the
real story is, what the exposures are, and what Enron will do to
rectify the situation.

     ``Until Enron gets out there to explain what the facts are
and what they are going to do about it, you could see a
continuation of these problems.

     ``The market is dealing with an information vacuum of the
company's own making. In the face of that uncertainty, it looks to
me like there are more and more people bailing out.''

On S&P's Negative Outlook:

     Traders see differences between the terms ``negative
CreditWatch'' and ``negative outlook,'' he said.

     ``I consider both to be serious indications that there is a
chance the rating is going to be downgraded, and I wouldn't
hesitate, if it were justified, to downgrade Enron off a negative
outlook. It is just as likely from a negative outlook as from a
negative CreditWatch.''

     ``CreditWatch is tied much more to an event.''

     ``Negative outlook should be sending just as serious a signal
as a negative CreditWatch would.''

On Counterparty Exposure:

     ``I fully expected'' counterparties to cut back their
exposure. ``It doesn't mean they are doing less business or are
shying away from Enron on concerns they won't get paid. Prudent
credit practices would dictate to any of these marketers that they
have to pay attention to what their exposure is to Enron at any
given time.''

     There won't be ``any real short-term or long-term damage to
the franchise value of Enron's marketing and trading business as
long as everything gets fixed, and they get past this current
situation and have the opportunity to deal with their credit
quality in the long run, then there isn't any long-term
implication or any real significant impact on their ability to
remain the market leader there.''

     ``The credit extended to Enron by its counterparties is
something that Enron looks at day to day.''

     ``We have no indication that'' firms have stopped dealing
with Enron, but if that happened, ``the situation could get
serious.''

On the Possibility of Being Downgraded to Junk:

     It is still a ``fairly remote possibility'' at this time that
Enron could lose its investment grade credit rating, he said.
``They have plenty of liquidity in the short-term that will get
them through the current situation.''

     ``There is a credible case to be made that'' there are
actions management has ``to take to restore the balance sheet to
investment-grade quality. Management is both willing and able to
take the steps necessary to do that. There's a really good chance
that if they can get through this period of uncertainty, they'll
be able to accomplish that.''

On Off-Balance Sheet Exposure:

     ``I don't think anybody has a good handle on exactly what the
shortfall might be there on all those vehicles. Part of the
company's responsibility at this point is to make the case to
rating agencies and outside investors and to all interested
parties, to lay out the facts, give assurances that there aren't
more surprises, that there is value in the assets there, and
should those assets fall short of the obligations, the willingness
to issue equity to make up that shortfall is there.''

Enron Fails to Get Funds From Institutional Investor, WSJ Says
2001-10-31 05:48 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. tried to get
financing from at least one institutional investor and was turned
down, the Wall Street Journal reported in its ``Heard on the
Street'' column, citing a person familiar with the situation.

     Enron was rejected because of uncertainties regarding its
finances. Late yesterday, the company's bankers were finishing
work on a new credit line of more than $1 billion, according to
people close to the discussions.

     General Electric Co.'s GE Capital, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
and Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. are considered potential buyers for
at least part of Enron, whose stock has fallen to 10-year lows and
is now trading at about book value, the paper said.

     An Enron spokesman wouldn't comment on the possibility of a
takeover or whether the company had approached prospective
investors, the paper reported.


Takeover Talk Can't Halt Enron Stock Plunge.

The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

Not even rumors of an impending buyout offer could stop the meltdown in Enro=
n common stock on Tuesday.=20
Enron shares fell $2.65 to close at $11.16/share Tuesday in spite of reports=
 that either BP, General Electric, or Royal Dutch/Shell was about to make a =
bid for the battered natural gas and power trading giant.
"I've heard all the rumors since Enron stock was in trouble the last time fo=
ur years ago, and I don't put any credence in them," said Carol Coale, a nat=
ural gas analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston. "I would question why=
 anyone would want to buy Enron when we don't know what the equity side of t=
he balance sheet is."=20
Coale predicted that the stock could fall to the $10-$11/share range before =
stabilizing. That is the range she estimates for Enron's current book value,=
 the worth it assigns to its assets. At the end of the second quarter, the b=
ook value was more than $13/share, she said.=20
The rumors apparently originated on various internet bulletin boards.=20
Enron stock has fallen more than 60% since third-quarter financial results s=
howing a $1 billion asset write-down, a $632 million net loss, and a $1.2 bi=
llion charge to equity were disclosed two weeks ago (OD Oct.17,p1). While va=
rious charges against earnings had been expected, the equity issue had not b=
een revealed previously. Investors and analysts were livid that Enron had no=
t honored its pledge to be more open and transparent about its financials.=20
The equity charge was related to the termination of two off-balance-sheet fi=
nancing vehicles that had been headed by Enron's former chief financial offi=
cer, Andrew S. Fastow, at the same time he was a corporate officer. Since th=
en, investors have filed multiple lawsuits charging Enron's management with =
conflicts of interest and failure to perform fiduciary duties. Fastow resign=
ed last week (OD Oct.25,p2).=20
Another factor driving the stock down further was the US Securities and Exch=
ange Commission's decision to transfer an informal inquiry into the Fastow s=
ituation to Washington, D.C., from Houston. The agency has not changed the s=
tatus of the matter to an investigation.=20
This week the company has been dealing with liquidity issues as it tries to =
arrange a new line of credit to augment the $3 billion it drew down from exi=
sting financial arrangements last week.=20
Enron Vice President Mark Palmer told Oil Daily that several parties in crud=
e and refined products trading had asked Enron to renegotiate credit terms, =
which the company will do. Those commodities represent only about 2% of Enro=
n's total trading book.=20
Natural gas and electricity make up around 98% of the company's business, an=
d those products "are trading as usual," he said.=20

Big volume, big drop for Enron shares=20
Shares of troubled energy trader Enron Corp. followed the rest of the market=
 Tuesday, closing down 19 percent at $11.16, its lowest level since 1992. Tr=
ading volume was high at 42.7 million shares, 47 percent more than any other=
 stock on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Enron has lost more than $17 billion in market capitalization in the past tw=
o weeks after a third-quarter earnings release that revealed deep losses cau=
sed in part by murky off-balance-sheet deals. Those deals, with partnerships=
 run by its former chief financial officer, led to a U.S. Securities and Exc=
hange Commission inquiry and a lower credit rating by one rating agency.=20
On Tuesday, Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale issued a report that s=
aid the stock price could fall as low as $9 since the company may need to se=
ll $6 billion in assets at a 20 percent discount in order to keep other cred=
it-rating agencies at bay. That could result in the issue of 120 million mor=
e shares, she said.=20
Coale also took note of speculation that Enron may be a takeover target but =
said such an attempt would most likely be made after the SEC inquiry is comp=
lete. SEC officials confirmed Tuesday that the inquiry has been moved from i=
ts Fort Worth office back to its New York headquarters.=20
"While we continue to believe that Enron is a going concern and that it will=
 avoid losing its investment-grade credit standing by selling assets and iss=
uing stock, we believe that the market will treat it as a credit risk," Coal=
e said.=20
That could change when the company provides more details on its financing pa=
rtnerships and secures new lines of credit from banks. News of the credit li=
nes is expected today.=20

RECKONINGS=20
The One-Eyed Man
By PAUL KRUGMAN
New York Times
Somewhere I read that to really understand legislation you have to look for =
the clause giving special consideration to one-eyed bearded men with a limp =
- that is, you have to look for the provision that turns a bill ostensibly s=
erving a public purpose into a giveaway for some special interest.=20
Most of the commentary about the "stimulus" bill passed by the House last we=
ek focuses on the huge benefits it lavishes on giant corporations. But that =
doesn't tell us much about the specific interests being served. What's good =
for corporate America is good for General Motors; it would be hard to devise=
 a bill that consists mainly of corporate giveaways without giving a lot of =
money to the biggest companies. To understand what the bill is really about,=
 you have to look at the big payoffs to not-so-big companies.
One piece of the bill is custom- designed to benefit a small group of multin=
ational financial firms. Another is clearly there for the sake of certain he=
alth insurors. But the most remarkable thing is how much of the benefit from=
 repeal of the alternative minimum tax - a measure that is also included in =
the Bush administration's supposed stimulus plan, and which seems to be one =
of the administration's key priorities - goes to companies that are not all =
that big.
For example, it's not too surprising that calculations by Citizens for Tax J=
ustice show General Motors, with its 380,000 workers, getting a check for $8=
00 million. But it's quite amazing that TXU (formerly Dallas Power and Light=
), a company with only 16,000 employees, would get a check for $600 million.=
 And there are a number of medium-sized companies that, like TXU, are in lin=
e for surprisingly big benefits. These companies include ChevronTexaco, Enro=
n, Phillips Petroleum, IMC Global and CMS Energy. What do they have in commo=
n?
Well, they tend to be in the energy or mining businesses; and they tend to b=
e based in or near Texas. In other words, the one-eyed bearded man with a li=
mp looks a lot like Dick Cheney.
There is almost certainly a lot of overlap between the companies that would =
derive large benefits from alternative minimum tax repeal and those that wou=
ld have received large subsidies under the energy plan devised by Mr. Cheney=
's task force. You may remember that the administration, in apparent defianc=
e of the law, refused to make the records of that task force's meetings avai=
lable to Congress; that's one of those issues that seems to have been droppe=
d after Sept. 11.=20
And I guess it's superfluous to point out that the big winners in all this s=
eem to be companies that gave large, one-sided donations to the Republican P=
arty in the last election. (This is not to suggest that Democrats are any le=
ss susceptible to the influence of money.)=20
To me, the story of the Bush administration is starting to look like the plo=
t of "Victor/Victoria." First we had a candidate who was supposed to be a mo=
derate. Then we learned, or thought we learned, that this was a mask; he was=
 really a hard-line conservative who pretended to be a moderate in order to =
gain office.=20
But the latest economic proposals from the administration, like the Cheney e=
nergy plan, don't look as if they came from serious free-marketeers. They do=
n't make sense in terms of either demand-side or supply-side economics, but =
they do give a lot of money to certain companies. So maybe ideology was just=
 another mask for someone who was really the candidate of corporations - not=
 corporations in general, but a small group of companies with a quite specif=
ic set of business interests - and who is only pretending to be a hard- line=
 conservative who pretended to be a moderate in order to gain office.
It's an interesting and all too plausible picture. But it's a picture that m=
ost people will never see on their TV, and that many people would refuse to =
accept no matter how strong the evidence. That, of course, is what makes the=
 whole thing possible. In the land of the blind, the one- eyed bearded man w=
ith a limp is king.
In last Wednesday's column I said the "original" war bonds were issued durin=
g World War II. In fact, war bonds were also issued during the Civil War and=
 World War I. I don't think this affects the argument.=20




Deal Sense
After the bubble - Tuesday
by Ed Paisley

10/31/2001
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

When bubbles burst, glimpses into the inner workings of deals often follow. =
The Internet bubble is proving no different.=20
At first glance, there doesn't seem to be a lot in common between embattled =
online energy trader and broadband telecom wannabe Enron Corp. and the MeVC =
Draper Fisher Jurvetson I Fund, a New York-listed closed-end venture capital=
 fund.
Yet Enron and Draper, Fisher Jurvetson not only epitomize a new-economy thin=
king that's gone awry but a kind of insider excess that was characteristic o=
f those now-departed go-go years.=20
Enron's shares have been falling since the markets began to recognize the da=
ngers of its plans to shed real assets to try its hand at selling broadband =
capacity alongside its big online energy trading business. Similarly, the Me=
VC Draper Fisher Jurvetson Fund I ? a retail fund that took the Draper Fishe=
r name but that wasn't run by the Silicon Valley VC ? now trades at a 42% di=
scount to its net asset value since its much-ballyhooed launch in 2000.=20
Enron thought the Internet would revolutionize its business, and it did ? by=
 further commoditizing the energy products the company sold. DFJ thought tha=
t venture capital itself could be commoditized and branded, and then peddled=
 to retail investors eager to pan for Internet gold dust.=20
Neither strategy worked; both failed to account for the risk in a changing e=
conomic climate.=20
Today, Enron finds itself a huge player in online energy trading and a strug=
gling startup in a battered telecom industry, strategic shifts that could we=
ll threaten its survival. The Houston company is making the rounds with bank=
ers trying to secure a lending line large enough to avoid yet another potent=
ially crippling credit downgrade.=20
DFJ engineered a truly top-of-the-bubble move into the VC "space," franchisi=
ng the firm's name to another band of VCs so that they could list a retail f=
und on the New York Stock Exchange. Closed-end funds rarely succeed in the b=
est of times; mixing VC and the closed-end fund formula just as the Internet=
 economy deflated proved even more problematic.=20
But while MeVC's investors are surely out of pocket, DFL itself is still pul=
ling in handsome management fees. MeVC Advisers Inc. and sub-adviser The Dra=
per Fisher Jurvetson MeVC Management Co. earn a 2.5% advisory fee and 20% in=
centive fee from its franchisee. High fees paid to various advisers are hard=
ly unknown in Silicon Valley, where institutional investors and pension fund=
s know the risks and are willing to pay the price to play. But MeVC Draper F=
isher Jurvetson Fund I was always meant to go to retail investors (with the =
obligatory SEC disclosures about risk and the fund's fees buried high up in =
the prospectus) who are, presumably, not as sophisticated.=20
Enron, of course, also chose to bury the cost of its dealings with its own e=
xecutives in an SEC filing. The hefty fees paid to Enron executives to manag=
e the risk of its new online trading strategy cost Enron CFO Andrew Fastow h=
is job last week.=20

PGE's financial loss first in years

10/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Saddled with surplus power, Portland General Electric =
posted a $5 million loss for the third quarter.=20
PGE recorded a total of $905 million in sales, but that didn't make up for h=
igh-priced electricity and an unpredictable wholesale market.
"Fuel costs and purchased power really ate away at net income," said Scott S=
imms, a utility spokesman.=20
Until recently, PGE had benefited from a surge in wholesale electricity pric=
es, which hit the West in the spring of 2000. But earlier this year wholesal=
e prices plummeted, electricity shortages eased and PGE found itself with su=
rplus power it no longer could sell for a gain.=20
PGE officials say they can't remember the last time the utility had recorded=
 a quarterly loss.=20
A third-quarter jump in expenses clearly showed through in PGE's financial r=
eport. The utility spent a record $814 million for wholesale electricity and=
 fuel, compared with $523 million for the year-ago period when energy shorta=
ges and skyrocketing power costs first began showing up in financial reports=
=2E=20
During the third quarter of 1999, a time of relative stability for energy ma=
rkets, PGE spent $241 million for electricity and fuel.=20
PGE owns power plants capable of meeting roughly half the demand of its 730,=
000 residential and business customers. It buys the rest of its electricity =
on wholesale markets.=20
A subsidiary of Houston-based Enron, the utility serves more Oregon customer=
s than any other utility. Its territory covers most of the populous northern=
 Willamette Valley.=20
PGE attributed the recent steep drop in electric power prices to federal pri=
ce controls, mild summer weather, added generation from new power plants, a =
fall in natural gas prices and conservation.=20
Drought conditions, which forced PGE to rely more heavily on natural gas-fir=
ed power plants rather than hydroelectric generation, further increased the =
utility's costs, PGE reported.=20
PGE disclosed its third-quarter loss in a filing late last week with the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission. The utility will submit its full quarterly =
report in mid-November.=20
Consistent gains PGE had posted a steady stream of quarterly gains at least =
since 1992, according to utility records.=20
Large rate increases, effective Oct. 1, are expected to generate an addition=
al $400 million annually and push earnings back into positive territory. Uti=
lity officials say the extra revenue will be used almost entirely for electr=
icity and fuel purchases.=20
Several business and consumer groups have objected to the Oct. 1 increases a=
nd have asked the Oregon Public Utility Commission to re-evaluate the decisi=
on that put the new rates into effect.=20
Regulators will decide by Nov. 23 whether to reconsider their decision.=20
Portland-based Northwest Natural Gas also is closely watching PGE's situatio=
n. NW Natural on Oct. 8 announced plans to buy PGE from Enron for almost $3 =
billion in cash, stock and assumed debt.

`Enron buy-out offer highly over-priced'
Seema Kamdar

10/31/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Energy analysts and anti-Enron activists have criticised the reporte=
d move by Indian financial institutions to buy out Enron's exposure to the t=
une of $1.3 billion at a 30 per cent discount.=20
A recent report suggested that a consortium of financial institutions led by=
 the Industrial Development Bank of India, which is also the lead banker for=
 the project, was negotiating picking up Enron's exposure in the project at =
a 30 per cent discount.
The reported pay-out for Enron's stake in the Dabhol Power Company is grossl=
y in excess of what the Madhav Godbole Committee had recommended.=20
Contending that the offer was highly over-priced, convenor of the Enron Viro=
dhi Andolan, Pradyumna Kaul, said, ``Enron, along with General Electric and =
Bechtel, has an equity stake of $900 million and a bridge loan of $300 milli=
on, which takes their total exposure to over $1 billion. The Godbole committ=
ee had recommended in its renegotiation report a five-year moratorium on all=
 loans and a discounting of Enron's equity to $250 million.''=20
The state government had accepted this formula while the Centre has talked i=
n terms of paying $500 million. ``All these computations are much lower than=
 the $700 million to $800 million that the financial institutions are willin=
g to pay,'' he said.=20
Mr Kaul said an independent study commissioned by his NGO had suggested a fo=
rmula much different from what Enron is hoping to negotiate. ``Out of the $3=
=2E1 billion project cost, the study says $1 billion can be written off. Hal=
f of this capital cost restructuring would come from writing down equity.''=20
To the argument that Indian FIs would lose out if they wrote off such huge a=
mounts, he said, ``Here, we are talking of writing off about Rs 5,500-6,000 =
crore out of Rs 13,000 crore. In the capital restructuring in the steel sect=
or, amounts of about Rs 20,000 crore were recently written off,'' he asserte=
d.=20
Abhay Mehta, author of `Power Play', an expose of the Enron deal, said, ``If=
 the FIs think they have evaluated Enron's stake fairly, it is a matter of g=
rave concern.''=20
An analyst with the Prayas Energy Group, Shantanu Dixit, questions the valid=
ity of Enron's insistence that it should be paid even for its ``development =
expenditure''. ``It has factored in $200 million on this count. But this amo=
unt was spent before the project went online. How can that be clubbed with t=
he project's capital cost?'' he said.=20
``The fundamental issue is where did they spend this money. This claim is of=
 a piece with Enron executive Linda Powers' statement that the company spent=
 $20 million on educating Indians,'' Mr Dixit said.=20
It is learnt that IDBI is not too happy with Enron's inclusion of $200 milli=
on as development expenditure and $140 million as earnings to be retained, i=
n its tally of $1.3 billion.=20
``Against this figure, the 30 per cent discount is notional,'' a source said=
=2E ``Without these two add-ons, there is simply no discount,'' he pointed o=
ut.=20
Another analyst who has followed Enron closely says that by no stretch of im=
agination can development expenditure be so high. ``The big question here is=
 how Enron has managed to inflate its cost? The Kirit Parikh committee had c=
laimed to have brought down the costs of the project from $2.8 billion to $2=
=2E5 billion. But Enron overshot the original estimate of $2.8 billion by an=
other $300 million. What is the explanation for this and why should financia=
l institutions pay for it?'' he said.=20
A Mantralaya official pointed out that a related issue was the future of the=
 LNG shipping company, Greenfield, floated by Enron to build a ship to suppl=
y fuel to Dabhol. Enron had a 30 per cent stake in it and the Shipping Corpo=
ration of India had a 40 per cent stake. ``It has refused to pay its $11 mil=
lion equity in that venture,'' he said.

Enron Queried by SEC on Debt, Partnership in 1998 (Update1)

Enron Queried by SEC on Debt, Partnership in 1998 (Update1)

     (Adds new CFO in eighth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. was asked by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998 to explain its
finances, including a partnership designed to take debt off its
books, according to an SEC letter.

     The 23-page document included 138 questions that asked about
the Jedi II partnership, Enron cash flows, hedging policies and
accounting for energy reserves. The agency this month began to
probe Enron's relationship to limited partnerships run by former
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``The 1998 questions are pretty much the same disclosure
issues that we are hearing about today, just different deals,''
said John Gavin, president of Plymouth, Minnesota-based SEC
Insight, a private research company that obtained the letter
through the Freedom of Information Act.

     SEC Insight provided a copy of the letter to Bloomberg News.
Enron Chief of Staff Steve Kean said the letter is from the SEC's
corporations and finance division, which he said regularly sends
questions to companies about the form and content of their
corporate filings.

     ``This is a quite common,'' Kean said. ``I'm sure that if you
did Freedom of Information Act requests for other large companies,
you would find similar letters with lengthy commentary.'' He said
``you can't really make a connection'' between the letter and the
current SEC inquiry.

                           Fastow Fired

     SEC spokesman Michael Robinson declined to comment on whether
the agency questioned Enron in 1998 or 1999, and wouldn't confirm
or deny that letters to Enron were sent.

     Enron shares fell for a 10th straight day, tumbling 19
percent after touching their lowest level in nine years. Moody's
Investor's Service placed the energy company's commercial paper
rating on review for downgrade and lowered its long-term debt to
two notches above junk status.

     The stock dropped $2.65 to $11.16.  Enron fired Fastow
Wednesday, the day after Enron disclosed the SEC had started an
inquiry into two partnerships formed in 1999. Transactions with
those partnerships cost Enron $35 million in the third quarter and
reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. Enron promoted Jeff
McMahon, head of the industrial markets unit, to CFO.

     In its most recent inquiry, the SEC has asked Enron about the
two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that were run
by Fastow and dealt in Enron assets and shares.

     The SEC has moved that inquiry to its Washington from its
offices in Fort Worth, Texas, a person familiar with the inquiry
said.

     Enron has formed dozens of affiliated companies to buy assets
such as power plants. Investors have been pressing Enron for more
details on the affiliated companies because some of them bought
company assets with borrowed money Enron will have to pay back if
the affiliates can't.

                      Partnership Questioned

     The workings of one affiliated company, Jedi II, stumped the
SEC in 1998.

     The agency asked Enron to ``either explain or cross reference
to discussion'' a fuller description of Jedi II. The company's
annual report to the SEC for 1998 lists Jedi, or Joint Energy
Development Investments LP, as an ``unconsolidated affiliate.''
Enron owned 50 percent of the company, the filing says.

     Fastow, Treasurer Ben Gilsan, President Greg Whalley and nine
other Enron executives are listed on Texas secretary of state
records as officers or partners of Jedi II. Enron has said in
recent days that employees listed as officers of affiliates do so
to represent Enron's interests and receive no compensation for
that role.

Enron Probe Is Moved to SEC's Head Office From Texas (Correct)

Enron Probe Is Moved to SEC's Head Office From Texas (Correct)

     (Corrects to $35 million the cost of financial dealings with
affiliate in fifth paragraph.)

     Washington, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Securities and
Exchange Commission, by transferring a probe of Enron Corp.'s
finances from Texas to Washington, may be handing the case to a
task force of enforcement lawyers and accountants, a former SEC
counsel said.

     The case was moved from the agency's Forth Worth district
office, a person with knowledge of the inquiry said. The transfer
was reported earlier today by the Wall Street Journal. An SEC
spokesman declined to comment, citing the agency's refusal to
discuss any investigation. Hal Degenhardt, administrator of the
Fort Worth office, didn't return a phone call.

     The SEC set up the accounting task force in Washington about
18 months ago, saying the unit's goals were to bring accounting-
related cases more quickly and to deal with complicated or novel
accounting issues. Under former Chairman Arthur Levitt, who left
the commission in February, the SEC declared accounting fraud to
be its top enforcement priority.

     ``It's possible that the SEC decided that it wanted that
group to handle the case,'' said Christian Mixter, a partner with
Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Washington and former SEC chief
litigation counsel.

     Last week, Houston-based Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow, after saying the SEC had sought information about
Enron's financial dealings with affiliates, run by Fastow, that
cost the largest energy trader $35 million.

     The SEC's headquarters staff has more enforcement
investigators with accounting expertise than do its regional and
branch offices, lawyers said.

                   Accounting Investigators

     The district offices ``are principally engaged in
investigating broker-dealer, investment-adviser and offering
violations,'' said John Sturc, a partner at the Gibson Dunn &
Crutcher law firm and former SEC associate enforcement director.

``While a few of them have the staff to investigate accounting
issues, generally the depth of experience is in the headquarters
office.''

     The SEC staff has opened investigations of dozens of large
companies, including Xerox Corp., ConAgra Foods Inc. and Lucent
Technologies Inc., that still are pending. As of mid-July, the SEC
was conducting about 260 accounting-fraud investigations,
including about 40 probes of large companies.

     SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt last week said the SEC will shift
its main accounting focus more toward improving financial
disclosure than prosecuting corporate financial fraud. ``I'm more
concerned about protecting investors before violations occur,''
Pitt said in an interview.

     Enron shares fell 19.2 percent today, after Moody's Investors
Service yesterday placed the company's rating for commercial paper
on review for downgrade and lowered its long-term debt to two
notches above junk status. Enron stock has plunged almost 46
percent since it disclosed the SEC's inquiry, and fell $2.65 today
to $11.16.

USA: NYMEX plans to start OTC natgas clearing services.

NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) said o=
n Tuesday it plans to offer credit intermediation through clearing services =
and trading tools to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.=20
The plan includes launching exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions =
and large order executions to the natgas futures market within the next few =
weeks, adding to its previously announced electronic trading of cleared natu=
ral gas swaps and basis contracts.
"Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necess=
ity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the Exchange=
's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrel=
la of our clearinghouse," NYMEX President J. Robert Collins said in the stat=
ement.=20
A swap is an unregulated contractual agreement between two parties which inv=
olves a guaranteed fixed price on an underlying commodity for a set period o=
f time that is later settled in cash.=20
Traders said the NYMEX announcement was well-timed in light of credit concer=
ns swirling in the gas market following Enron's recent stock plunge.=20
Houston-based Enron Corp. , the biggest U.S. natural gas and electricity tra=
ding house, saw its shares slump 19 percent Tuesday to $11.16, their lowest =
level since 1992.=20
NYMEX said $500 million will be available as a guarantee to participants on =
each of the Exchange divisions through a fund backed by exchange clearing me=
mbers, nearly eliminating credit risk between individual parties.=20
EFS transactions - similar to exchange of futures for physical (EFP) transac=
tions - allow two parties to privately negotiate an integrated OTC swap and =
related futures transaction priced according to their own mutual terms.=20
The transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market=
 quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities=
 and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the under=
lying futures contract.=20
EFS transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futu=
res market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.=20
The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify NY=
MEX of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price at which=
 the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties =
involved.=20
NYMEX will also start letting traders execute block trades of 250 natural ga=
s futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at the best bid o=
r offer for that size. These trades will not be permitted during the closing=
 range.=20
The exchange said that early next year it will launch a cleared Henry Hub na=
tural gas swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on =
the most popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.=20
As part of this move, NYMEX said it will clear OTC-executed transactions thr=
ough its EFS mechanism.

USA: UPDATE 3-Enron shares plunge 19 percent, hit 1992 levels.
By C. Bryson Hull

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. dropped 19 percent to thei=
r lowest level since 1992 on Tuesday, amid fears of a credit crunch and pers=
istent investor concerns over its silence about the energy giant's finances.=
=20
The stock was the most active by far on the New York Stock Exchange as the b=
iggest trader of natural gas and power in North America suffered another rou=
t in its 10th straight day of losses.
Houston-based Enron has shed more than $17 billion in market capitalization =
in the past two weeks amid a series of disclosures about murky off-balance-s=
heet deals with partnerships run by its then chief financial officer.=20
The disclosures destroyed the stock, forced the ouster of CFO Andrew Fastow,=
 led to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission conflict-of-interest inqui=
ry and have caused at least one credit rating agency to slash Enron's senior=
-debt credit status.=20
Enron stock closed down $2.65 to $11.16 in trading volume of 42.7 million sh=
ares, a good 47 percent more than the next most active stock on the NYSE.=20
The shares crossed the $12 threshold in the morning for the first time since=
 January 1993, then repeatedly tested the $11 barrier throughout the session=
 before touching a low of $10.95 shortly before the close - its lowest level=
 since July 1992.=20
"This Enron situation is unique, and uniquely bad. The inability of the mana=
gement to make a satisfactory response to all these claims and innuendoes ha=
s caused a mighty run on the stock for these past few weeks," said Sanders M=
orris Harris analyst John Olson.=20
"I for one am at a loss to explain their reticence to respond."=20
Enron said it was working to address its credibility gap.=20
"We have heard the criticism loud and clear and we have made a commitment to=
 change those perceptions. (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) Ken Lay an=
d everyone else on this management team has made it their priority to bring =
investor confidence up to the strong level of our core business," Enron spok=
esman Vance Meyer said.=20
FOCUSING ON NEAR-TERM=20
One analyst suggested that Enron was focusing management firepower on cleari=
ng the SEC inquiry and securing new credit lines from its banks to address t=
he concerns of the credit rating agencies.=20
"They're focused on those two things, and I think if they successfully do th=
ose things they will find they will not be downgraded below investment grade=
," Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said.=20
If Enron's credit drops below investment grade at current stock levels, it w=
ould be forced to issue more shares and further dilute the stock. Worse, Mea=
de said, it would drastically increase Enron's cost for trading, as counterp=
arties demand more cash and guarantees for deals.=20
Olson said the stock price was irrationally low, even assuming a conservativ=
e valuation of Enron's businesses at 14 times estimated 2001 earnings per sh=
are of $1.81.=20
The company's core trading business is worth about $23 per share at those le=
vels, Olson said. The total company, even accounting for losses from the fai=
ling broadband business, is worth about $27 now as opposed to $37 two weeks =
ago, he said.=20
After cutting Enron's rating on Monday, Moody's Investors Service warned it =
could lower the rating even further, as well as cut Enron's short-term debt =
status. The cut coincided with Enron's confirmation that it was seeking addi=
tional credit lines to increase its liquidity, after tapping its full $3.3 b=
illion revolving credit line last week.=20
Enron has seen its credibility demolished as it has given piecemeal answers =
about its involvement in financial partnerships so complex as to confound ev=
en seasoned financial analysts who make their living unraveling earnings sta=
tements and balance sheets.=20
Fastow was general partner in two partnerships, which paid him millions in m=
anagement fees, that did business with Enron. They caused a $1.2 billion los=
s in shareholder equity after Enron was forced to repay the partnerships wit=
h stock once their investments, many into broadband, soured.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock plummeted to a nine-year low on Tuesday, =

Shares of Enron, the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer, fell $=

Enron's stock price decline steadily from nearly $85 at the beginning until =
the middle of October, when the company reported earnings and serious questi=
ons about its fiscal health were raised.=20
Since reporting a disappointing quarterly losses on Oct. 16, Enron has been =
negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines and has been surrounded=
 by turmoil because of losses stemming from partnerships managed by the comp=
any's former chief financial officer.=20
The partnerships have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest=
 and touched off an inquiry by the SEC.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday the SEC investigation has been move=

Analysts say the change was interpreted to mean the investigation is more se=
rious than originally thought.=20
"I would imagine that (the falling stock price) must be attributed to the SE=
C shift in venue. That is today's goblin" with Enron's stock price, said Rob=
ert Christensen, an analyst with FAC/Equities in New York.=20
Enron officials did not immediately return messages left Tuesday by The Asso=

confirm or deny the investigation had been moved.=20
Shares of Enron were sacked by more than 10 percent on Monday after Moody's =
Investors Service downgraded the company's long-term debt and warned of poss=
ible further downgrades.=20
Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one=
-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled asse=

"A vote of confidence by an outside financial institution, a commercial bank=
