Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax =
(who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that fl=
owed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash fo=
recast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort o=
f thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week a=
go the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to u=
pdate Enpower in "Schedule" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  D=
iana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicat=
ing that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwai=
te that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work =
off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on=
 the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the rig=
ht information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better o=
ff doing it "right" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, a=
nd Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  =
As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a=
 cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between =
various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminate=
d deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, throu=
gh the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the schedu=
ling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we c=
an come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to da=
te as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in =
Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk,=
 should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremen=
tal deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would=
 make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the ch=
anges in Deal Scheduling, we can do so. =20

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets=
 for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would lik=
e us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set=
 up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend. =20

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please l=
et me know.

Diana Scholtes
West Desk=20
