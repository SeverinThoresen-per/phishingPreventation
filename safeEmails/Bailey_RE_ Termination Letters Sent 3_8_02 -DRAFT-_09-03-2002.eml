Louis,

I have entered the requested information relating to termination letters -- =
however, Whirlpool Corporation was not in default @ the time that the first =
batch of Demand Letters were sent out.  Therefore, we would not yet be sendi=
ng them a Termination Letter.

In light of the foregoing, I guess if they are in default???? Should they no=
w receive a Demand Letter????

We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will rec=
eive termination letters today.  Several CPs have outstanding issues which w=
e are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been p=
aid).  Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the =
following CPs.  Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from =
"live" to "terminated."

Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
-----------------------------		-------
Johns Manville Int'l.		$8.6
Kerr-McGee En. Servs. Corp.	$3.6
Virginia Power			$9.3
Whirlpool Corp.			$0.2
	Total			$21.7

Please note that this list may change over the course of the day as we conti=
nue our research and issue resolution on each CP.  Additionally, the MTM val=
ues may be different once the positions are valued at the appropriate termin=
ation date.

Don, the above is slightly different from the CPs I provided verbally earlie=
r today.
