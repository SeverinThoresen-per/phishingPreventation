Hi Luiz -- Friday I saw an email from SPP about changes to SPP's credit poli=
cy.  Unfortunately, I cannot find the email now.  Can you check into this wi=
th SPP (maybe on the web page or you may have seen the email) and talk with =
Mike Carson, in trading, about what commercially would/may be impacted by an=
y proposed changes.  For example, it may only deal with LT transmission, whi=
ch we don't usually purchase.  If it involves a need for more credit assuran=
ce from Enron, please check with Bill Bradford's group (credit) and let Jim =
and Imr know.=20
=20
Also, Mike Roan is leaving Enron to go to AEP.  Mike will be in the office t=
his coming week.  Can you talk with Mike and Kerry so you all have the compl=
ete download as to what is going on in the Midwest, both in MISO and Allianc=
e (due dates for FERC filings, meetings, committees, etc.)  If Andy is in th=
e office, please include him too. =20
=20
Thanks for your help Luiz and welcome to our new wholesale group!  Christi
