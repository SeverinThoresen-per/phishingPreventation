  Rationale


    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso=20
Electric Co. back toward
    investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20
targets and expects debt to be
    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=20
one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,
    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=20
the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to
    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hig=
h=20
fixed costs, and high rates.=20

    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Verd=
e=20
nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of
    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and conti=
nued=20
structural problems add some risk to the
    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customers=
 in=20
the generally low-income service
    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=20
investment, helping to put El Paso Electric
    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=20
the company to keep a $25 million
    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation of=
=20
generation and transmission assets,
    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electri=
c=20
franchise.=20

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=20
Mexico and Texas, bringing them
    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=20
comes to either state (2002), El Paso
    Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should allo=
w=20
them to retain retail customers. By that
    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=20
transmission and distribution business
    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=20
Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred
    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20
charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges
    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=20
regulated market) will be recovered over
    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20
settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs
    through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the=20
settlement agreement.=20

    In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts wit=
h=20
the Comision Federal de
    Electricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacity=
=20
in the summer months of 2000 and 2001,
    and with the Rio Grande Electric Cooperative Inc. to supply power to two=
=20
Texas cities over a four-year period.
    Importantly, El Paso Electric also reached a settlement with the city of=
=20
Las Cruces, N.M., ending a long dispute
    over that city=01,s threat to municipalize the electric distribution sys=
tem.=20
Las Cruces sales account for about 8% of
    total revenue.=20
