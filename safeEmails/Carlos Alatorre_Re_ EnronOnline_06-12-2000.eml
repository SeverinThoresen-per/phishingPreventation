I am delighted and thankful.  On our side, I'm fairly sure I can enlist the=20

necessary minimum while we benefit from his experience.

I will coordinate with my team and call Carlos next week to see whether he=20
wants to take advantage of my presence in Houston the week of the 11th to=20
15th of December to be briefed on the status of our efforts (and to be=20
briefed on our next to do's).

Again, thanks for your support,

Remi
