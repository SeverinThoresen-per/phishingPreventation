Greg mentioned today that you had asked about Paul Goddard and his continuin=
g interest in Canada.  I've been offering Paul the chance to do much more ou=
tward-facing commercial work digging into things like Huberator and PowerITS=
 (from this morning's articles) as well as any potential sales of our platfo=
rm technology in Europe.  He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to=
 be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within t=
he next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary=
 Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with h=
er before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining tract=
ion in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is =
wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help i=
n 2 ways.  First, if you know Heather and are comfortable nudging her toward=
 our shop, I think it would go a long way.  Second, if you are familiar with=
 anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoul=
ders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.  Clearly Paul =
and Lara are doing a great job, but we need even more firepower over there t=
o iron out some of the issues the desks are facing, both internally and exte=
rnally.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,
Brad
