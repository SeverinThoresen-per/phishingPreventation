Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some i=
tems to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 4=
18,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this=
 deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002=
=2E  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us kn=
ow please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would ans=
wer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 =3D $222,98=
7.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

 the gas.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for M=

 get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as b=

is not advisable. =20

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  Thi=
s is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christ=
ina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can se=
ll the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell=
 the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and refere=
nce our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Dep=
aolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay =
for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #=
1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the=
 operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer a=
ll out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they ar=
e active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them =
in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas=
=2E  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not=
 let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balanc=
e and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Bala=
nce, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA ow=
es Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the p=
ayment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set=
 to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.=20



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat=20
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are =
under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal und=
er this contract. =20

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not=
 paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal we=
re to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONA=
T ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off=
 the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sona=
t let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In =
Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balan=
ce of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat=
 will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on dea=
l #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas=
 Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balan=
ce on this deal is 92,949 dth =3D [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov=
 - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's lette=
r, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets=
=2E  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this =
account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in=
 August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,9=
98 at an average price of $3.063 =3D $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA d=
id not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat g=
as - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 d=
th day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the =
parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA f=
rom withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat de=
al in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a me=
ssage for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to b=
e reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penal=
ties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going=
 to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA di=
d supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would ve=
rify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is s=
till honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA i=
f ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract=
=2E
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversat=
ion on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat =
Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have ac=
cess to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina cal=
led Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara sai=
d she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its =
ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas =
without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a spe=
cific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying th=
is gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the ga=
s without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and wh=
en I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.
