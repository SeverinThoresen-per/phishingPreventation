Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiatin=
g with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, and=
 is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar with=
 the matter.=20
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and h=
ead off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence. =
The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out=
 after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves =
and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit li=
ne, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in=
 nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favori=
te of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convinci=
ng a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its f=
inances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier thi=
s month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 bil=
lion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it =
had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew=
 Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistentl=
y said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on=
 the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enr=
on shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept=
=2E 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that mo=
ney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial pap=
er, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standar=
d & Poor's said he believes that Enron was "getting a bit more resistance" r=
ecently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron pro=
bably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he =
said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and =
still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand=
 would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing =
Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower =
rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor co=
nfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last we=
ek could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets=
, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are d=
oing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in the=
 past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," he s=
aid. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron woul=
d be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's financ=
es.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase =
& Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new=
 credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to =
show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confiden=
ce in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the negotia=
tions for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonst=
rate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have acc=
ess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Th=
us, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustra=
tes the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy marke=
ts, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many =
of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are =
the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases=
 from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking,=
 Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of w=
hich there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for th=
e company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron'=
s revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No lon=
ger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues,=
 but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and =
more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and sellin=
g stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at aroun=
d 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation th=
an the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke En=
ergy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-bas=
ed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Acco=
rding to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued a=
ccordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's =
stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price =
then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stran=
ge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Californi=
a's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stateme=
nts. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic sch=
olars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's trou=
bles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure ther=
e was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or h=
ow it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that th=
ey really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low re=
turn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came fro=
m asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from ene=
rgy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- =
or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company=
 filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. =
According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the mana=
ging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "manage=
 price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by =
entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was, in a=
 phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market =
-- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing =
and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially whe=
n the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed=
 his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- =
and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done=
=2E=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership=
 allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron =
relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-do=
llar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed =
hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were =
left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a ye=
ar ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the comp=
any. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea tha=
t horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the =
wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which=
 look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current ro=
und of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen=
, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic =
arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transpare=
ncy.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of =
oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and ret=
ired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It =
is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- =
perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure inves=
tors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involvi=
ng its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion i=
n additional financing from banks, an industry official said today.=20
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3=
 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off com=
mercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to con=
vince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash =
squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do bu=
siness with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last tw=
o weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting t=
his afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actio=
ns when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced =
by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its =
former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. =
The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it s=
aid last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquir=
y into its financial accounting.=20
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial=
 to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Late=
ly, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two =
major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the compan=
y's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds=20
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mut=
ual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the havoc=
 may continue.=20
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embatt=
led company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to fu=
nd tracker Morningstar.=20
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely t=
o be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's halv=
ing in October is due to large sales by institutional holders.=20
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholder=
 according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m sha=
res representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn.=20
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at F=
riday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.=
81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week=
 on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created=
 by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leadin=
g rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond p=
rices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January.=20
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in=
 which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with l=
arge Enron stakes have said their listed positions are "dated", implying tha=
t the funds' positions in the company have changed.=20
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said manage=
rs of the group's larger funds had been "lightening up" their Enron holdings=
 this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship J=

2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when.=20
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also decl=

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the=
 US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeli=
ng management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-base=
d company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school prof=
essors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-gro=
wing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Se=
curities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals=
 with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer,=
 which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-con=
vened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it=
 answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of Andy Fa=
stow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron h=
as also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed i=
t was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20
"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer,=
 an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deter=
iorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor r=
elations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture a=
nd dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to hav=
e also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cauti=
onary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic on to o=
ld economy companies.=20
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey =
Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to de=
velop energy trading.=20
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulati=
ng US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy unde=
r-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who s=
pearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying =
it.=20
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always =
been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more l=
ikely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in =
the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his =
first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging o=
f financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A =
management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, =
director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Empl=
oyees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they deliv=
ered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was all a=
bout creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management mo=
del expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McK=
insey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy busi=
ness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in exi=
sting markets.=20
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. L=
ouise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force =
behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jo=
bs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ris=
k, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr Sk=
illing once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear your d=
eals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want a=
round here."=20
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets i=
n its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivat=
ives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable clim=
atic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The s=
uccess of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's le=
ading e-commerce company.=20
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint ve=
nture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet =
service provider.=20
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive =
of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerfu=
l US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of Ame=
rica and Boeing.=20
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ach=
ieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he a=
bruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health =
related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanatio=
n.=20
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to =
avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron us=
ed a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the=
 private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast=
 of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other finan=
cing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Az=
urix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moore of M=
oody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency=
=2E The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=
al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have lit=
tle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to =
which it is exposed.=20
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many in=
vestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: =
"The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need =
for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding somethi=
ng or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be quest=
ionable."=20
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, s=
tem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skill=
s," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants in =
India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail mark=
et, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are=
 all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy =
business."=20
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for so=
me of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron=
 Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped=
 push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tradin=
g volumes failed to materialise.=20
"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett, =
a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company.=
 "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broad=
band business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the=
-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant ene=
rgy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barn=
ey points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of ea=
rnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past t=
hree years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal=
 before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of real=
isable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.=20
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and c=
redibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight manag=
ement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team wil=
l have to tighten up.=20

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade ba=
nks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall =
in its share price.=20
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board me=
eting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disc=
losures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its fin=
ancial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for a=
dditional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financ=
ial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have someth=
ing to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "establish addition=
al lines of liquidity". "Once we are able to get the liquidity position shor=
ed up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest," Mr Palmer said.=
=20
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 1=
6 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' e=
quity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private eq=
uity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who=
 was forced to take a leave of absence last week.=20
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 an=
nouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically "j=
unk" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade.=20
"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abili=
ty to operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles of=
 Salomon Smith Barney. "These activities require at least an investment grad=
e credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirem=
ents."=20
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a requ=
est for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron flick=

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investo=
rs and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas =
now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business=
 dealings.=20
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its cre=
dit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transac=
tions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the pas=
t week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is=
 not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the m=
arket volatility that drove earnings last year eases.=20
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other po=
wer producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for spl=
itting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can=
 be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy.=20
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common theme=
s affecting the industry.=20
"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. An=
d two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven gro=
wth," Patterson said.=20
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some pow=
er companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And =
plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off.=20
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on =
the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.=20
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED=20
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecu=
tive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said T=
hursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off as=
sets.=20
"It's a different place," AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of =
the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerf=
ul growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimo=
re Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading =
operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also =
hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which plann=
ed to make an equity investment in the company.=20
"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy=
, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will=
 be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver," said Chri=
stian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman.=20
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES=20
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphas=
is on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business.=20
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80=
 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it pr=
ovides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, ac=
cording to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise.=20
"Calpine does it already," he said, referring to the California-based indepe=
ndent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates con=
tracted out. "What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was=
 that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low=
=2E But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - th=
ere is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere =
near that level," he added.=20
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should=
 remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spre=
ads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies.=20
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES=20
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back=
 to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line.=20
"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002=
 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revi=
sion of earnings guidance." said Patterson.=20
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second ti=
me to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certa=
in overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America.=20
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge f=
or planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distrib=
ution units as well as other international investments.=20
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in th=
ird quarter earnings.=20
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getti=
ng necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its =
unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time.=20
"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstra=
ted value can and will be created for shareholders," Allegheny said.

Enron Said Seeking New Credit Lines

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly neg=
otiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew=
 down billions on its existing lines.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies wit=
h the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, wit=
h an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding "in addition to=
 derivatives and other structured product exposures," according to Goldman S=
achs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan=
 facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securi=
ties Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 mill=
ion loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the =
data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also partic=
ipated, Securities Data said.=20
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that "in order to dispel uncertainty i=
n the financial community," it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to=
 provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported=
 on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was =
in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line.=20
"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- =
that's nothing out of the ordinary," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode.=20
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the dep=
arture of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Com=
mission inquiry.=20
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy =
trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and ser=
vices, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines.=20
"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested =
along with Enron in some of its partnerships," said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesm=
an for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not=
 know the amount of its exposure.=20
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. B=
ank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million=
 of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrus=
t Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, accord=
ing to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 mil=
lion of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have som=
e lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said.=20
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with=
 Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd ,=
 said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy giant =
Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant.=20
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate of=
 Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning therm=
al power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island of=
 Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other t=
han our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power marke=
t," a Teijin spokesman said.=20
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last y=
ear, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers.=20
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducin=
g domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It i=
s thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus.=20
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's exist=
ing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at t=
he inefficient small plant with the help of Enron.=20
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefie=
d natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become th=
e first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan.=20
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility st=
udy by June 2002.=20
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron?=20
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant e=
nergy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pers=
uade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Californ=
ia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views w=
ould be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron'=
s arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consu=
mer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electr=
icity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enr=
on said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the compan=
y profited from creating new markets.=20
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing tho=
se who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peopl=
e want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's t=
he American way.''=20
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's=
 investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are =
mounting.=20
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company =
worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted=
 and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron =
could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedg=
e fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enro=
n's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion i=
n shareholder value.=20
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low=
 of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and =
soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended =
only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening=
 deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water=
 supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity ha=
ve been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L.=
 Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resu=
me day-to-day control of the company.=20
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available=
 for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling=
 could not be reached.=20
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its =
shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bill=
ion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enro=
n's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is =
looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question =
whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading elec=
tricity and natural gas.=20
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall =
in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief =
financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy=
 over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed t=
o be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today face=
s a potential cash crunch.=20
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern=
 about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts a=
nd bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transac=
tions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issu=
ing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash.=20
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On T=
hursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously =
arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, whic=
h have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importanc=
e in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any =
problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected eve=
n if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a pro=
ducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility =
of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thou=
ght Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would=
 happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronO=
nline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they=
 good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said=
=2E ''It's got everyone scared.''=20
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the c=
ompany's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue=
 tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. =
But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuab=
le, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the com=
pany.=20
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders=
 and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the comp=
any's sales and profits.=20
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But i=
ts bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now of=
fering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds.=
 Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service an=
d Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible dow=
ngrades.=20
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' s=
aid Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aq=
uila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Ka=
nsas City, Mo.=20
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reli=
ant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busines=
s with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricit=
y and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling remin=
iscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they =
are closing their books down,'' he said.=20
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefu=
lly at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also sa=
id risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to =
discuss the situation.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading compa=
ny had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of =
the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He sai=
d the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is ju=
st a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the=
 details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street ana=
lysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own it=
s stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating luc=
rative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrabil=
ity of its financial statements.=20
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to=
 the questions investors ask.=20
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial stateme=
nts parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly re=
gulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron=
 to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant=
 hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and o=
utsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cre=
ated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names l=
ike Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds =
outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company =
subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the va=
lue of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the diffe=
rence.=20
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial office=
r when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholder=
s' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimp=
y details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, a=
fter being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promis=
sory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equit=
y by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction=
 was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have f=
ound a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements=
 into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it re=
ported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earni=
ngs statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down.=
 But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its=
 shares rose.=20
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's =
chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference =
was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analyst=
s were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and man=
y were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, a=
nd investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, =
the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved invest=
ors.=20
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain t=
he deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about =
Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who =
appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and M=
r. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details ab=
out the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, =
he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gras=
p of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking abo=
ut them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we c=
an say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the compa=
ny expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the =
end of next year.=20
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enro=
n executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its oth=
er partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, =
leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the co=
mpany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clar=
ify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very ne=
ar term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that wo=
uld affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will li=
kely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after=
 the call.=20
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its=
 Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, =
a higher-than-normal volume.=20
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibili=
ty with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay sai=
d in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength i=
s the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enro=
n's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years=
=2E=20
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-=
sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new sh=
ares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that=
 Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that=
 Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign ass=
ets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embr=
oiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those =
prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy.=20
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their b=
acks, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesd=
ay, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when =
management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company discl=
osed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than anal=
ysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-lo=
sing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say.=20
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busines=
s, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of res=
earch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7,=
 when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these tran=
sactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitabl=
e.''=20
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fal=
l, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the l=
osses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood=
 by its reported energy-trading profits.=20
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture =
of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped=
 out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tradi=
ng book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in r=
oughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that =
they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and=
 disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully l=

ld be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.=20
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the =
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale ele=
ctricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of =
specific transactions and prices.=20
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. En=
ron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-q=
uarter of all trading in the United States.=20
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale el=
ectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business =
was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and th=
eir rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by s=
tate regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent a=
nd unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-gro=
wing portion of the nation's power.=20
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also=
 deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline comp=
any, to move into the trading business.=20
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-19=
90's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Febr=
uary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the ch=
ange in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its princ=
ipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had=
 said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products=
=2E''=20
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall S=
treet accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first t=
ransactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief =
financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals wer=
e routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement.=
=20
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit =
lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to =
be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to p=
ay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment=

Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact =
the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the sh=

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corp=
oration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chie=
f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Beca=
use they were transactions among related parties, the company was required t=
o disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answer=
ed. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currentl=
y available answers.=20
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it =
said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets=
,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunica=
tions companies.=20
Q. How did those investments do?=20
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosu=
re on that.=20
Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactio=
ns with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative=
 securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial dis=
closures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements co=
mpletely.=20
Q. Why were they so complicated?=20
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One ac=
counting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on tr=
ansactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and=
 then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. B=
ut shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that cas=
e reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the tr=
ansactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall unde=
r that rule.=20
Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not al=
l of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears t=
hat the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything s=
eemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profit=
s each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclose=
d was not really important.=20
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By thi=
s summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partners=
hips. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related t=
o Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the tra=
nsactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its =
deals with the partnerships.=20
Q. How did Enron do?=20
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transacti=
ons involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also =
reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Q. How did that happen?=20
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership=
 owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron=
=2E In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligation=
s to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a sha=
re buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and dete=
rmined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce report=
ed earnings.=20
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to s=
ay for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to e=
nable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them=
=2E That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, whi=
ch has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Investors Seem to Ignore Discouraging News

Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the econ=

xpected. They also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining =
from a year ago, at some companies by more than 30 percent.=20

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquid=
ity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, usi=
ng $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.=20
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are compl=
eted the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell =
to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before en=
ding the day at $15.40, down 95 cents.=20
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks norm=
ally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, =
and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion.=20
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below invest=
ment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an ear=
ly default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be =
able to sell more commercial paper.=20
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed th=
at its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show =
a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated tr=
ansactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who =
was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday=
=2E=20
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement,=
 and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as asked questions about its accounting practices.

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy pric=
e for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plumme=
ted.=20
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announce=
d a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-balan=
ce sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched=
 an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar wit=
h a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at =
these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for ba=
nkruptcy.=20
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to bu=
y back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the c=
ompany on negative watch.=20
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, i=
s one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis.=20
"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners tha=
t they are creditworthy and continue with business," said Robin West, chairm=
an of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. "In a situati=
on like this, cash is king."=20
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterpar=
ties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more co=
llateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business.=20
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that.=20
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well=
=2E But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company co=
uld still be severely damaged by the scandal.=20
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its mo=
st recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow,=
 the company's former chief financial officer.=20
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure b=
y promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity invest=
ments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a cer=
tain level.=20
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which shoul=
d have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed.=20
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same=
 balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from=
 marking their private equity investments to market.=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader=
 tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading=
 market for low-interest, short-term loans.=20
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors quest=
ioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial=
 officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock=
 Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that =
the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in comm=
ercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks of=
fer.=20
"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassad=
y, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People are =
questioning the credibility of management."=20
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial p=
aper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points=
 to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price,=
 the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%.=20
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut aft=
er $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron need=
s good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding co=
llateral and to settle transactions.=20
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said S=
tephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and time=

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that c=

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10.=20
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now bee=
n stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I.=
 has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than=
 waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly ze=
ro have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one=
 has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bus=
h team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun unti=
l more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted break=
through in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that =
''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- p=
roved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school chi=
ldren again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.=
O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That =
Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everythi=
ng changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-fron=
t failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but d=
irect products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularl=
y its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the r=
ight -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prude=
nce in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, th=
e administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily=
 as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutica=
l companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea f=
or all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stim=
ulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy c=
ompany (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign c=
ash machine.=20
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since S=
ept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Servi=
ceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is=
 another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats =
first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Da=
schle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in han=
ding the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the sa=
laries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of =
their employees.=20
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland s=
ecurity, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back =
to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge=
=2E=20
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a =
large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A=
 close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration f=
rom the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, i=
ncluding the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because=
 he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the admini=
stration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have=
 brought us where we are today.=20
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those =
of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber o=
f Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcr=
oft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps J=
ohn Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override pub=
lic policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no re=
ason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic =
duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.=20
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credib=
ility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along w=
ith its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines =
it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility=
 by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of sci=
ence. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requestin=
g to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it ear=
marked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is=
 adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert=
 estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republica=
n Bill Frist.=20
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks =
of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- Da=
vid Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public h=
ealth -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, b=
ecame persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report=
 on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge=
 arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag.=20
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informatio=
n about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which =
has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim nece=
ssity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sough=
t a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never bee=
n granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier,=
 Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her =
organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, =
has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and dome=
stic terrorism.''=20
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops =
offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication o=
f how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't resp=
ond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, t=
hat one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of da=
ys ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (per=
haps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services=
 inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there=
 wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. g=
immick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first plac=
e reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland=
 security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agen=
cies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. =
Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a ve=
ry busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more=
 confusion.=20
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw=
 -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to s=
hoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. Th=
at presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for an=
y homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codif=
ied days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can=
 only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the wa=
r here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban=
, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intr=
actability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead o=
f a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to b=
e solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because t=
he Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C=
=2EE.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or poli=
tics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Sho=
ulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuri=
ng to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares =
worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch =
that has left the company's credibility in ruins.=20
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold =
about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.=
8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors =
who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by Ju=
ly. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron decli=
ned to comment on the share sales.=20
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the =
financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron=
's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep ano=
ther $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us if =
we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."=20
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission int=
o partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer.=20
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to re=
store confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong.=20
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed inv=
estments".

At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which i=
s India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million =
investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel.=20
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from I=
ndia's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the sec=
ond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped in=
 June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSE=
B.=20
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no=
 longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and serv=
ed a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.=20
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the ma=
tter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a fi=
nal termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That si=
x month period expires on November 19.=20
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that=
 it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian=
 government.=20
TIME RUNNING OUT=20
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also=
 discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novembe=
r 19.=20
"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as =
saying.=20
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to a=
rbitration, which would not help India.=20
"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situ=
ation DPC will win hands down," the paper added.=20
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately.=20
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the =
dispute so far.=20
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, =
but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest.=
=20
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the=
 founders agree to sell their stake at a discount.=20
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power =
and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percen=
t stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.=20
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less th=
an $1 billion, the paper added.=20
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.=

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for bro=
adband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest software=
 company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions.=20
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the=
 high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leaving =
MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- where=
 Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director of ma=
rketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to of=
fer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential custome=
rs in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is maki=
ng a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner.=20
"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and =
at the same time we are evaluating other providers," Visse said.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing com=
pany policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest e=
nergy trader.=20
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MS=
N Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver ope=
rational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and=
 ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported.=20
Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering an=
d billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported.=20
Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry=20
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to million=
s of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them=
 to get Microsoft's products instead.=20
The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that=
 Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsof=
t later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browse=
rs after all.=20
Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift=
 of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reic=
hard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site.=20
Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and =
federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusin=
g Microsoft of anti-competitive practices.=20

MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsof=
t next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's =
PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market,=
 a Sony spokeswoman said.=20
The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's=
 San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Dig=
ital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoma=
n Kirsten Maynard said.=20
In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays an=
d sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software.=
 In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advance=
d-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15.=20
"A lot has changed with both companies," Maynard said. "It sort of became no=
t-a-fit anymore."=20
Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nin=
tendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't b=
e reached for comment on the shutdown.=20
