I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the "killed"=20
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular)=
=20
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to=20
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying=20
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do=
=20
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success=20
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff=20
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one=20
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one=20
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served=
=20
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I=20
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times. =
=20
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not =
a=20
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our=20
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life=20
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster=
=20
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not th=
e=20
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is=20
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward=20
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application=20
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on=20
for the past few weeks.=20

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own=20
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is=20
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all.=
=20
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to=20
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we=20
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if=20
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do=20
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised.=20
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in=
=20
any way.

Thanks,
Kate

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI=
=20
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

      =20
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they wer=
e=20
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wante=
d=20
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and=20
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal. =20


           Kroum=20

The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and=20
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal.=20
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to=20
Desk" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done=20
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our=20
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their=20
stuff, they should see their side.=20

        Cara,

     This is all I have so far. I would appreciate your help to make it=20
clearer.

     If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.


     Thanks,
     Kroum

Forward Obs should show two sides of a Cross-Portfolio deal.  Find out what=20
needs to be done.  Contact Monica
Lande or Kate Symes in Portland for more details
