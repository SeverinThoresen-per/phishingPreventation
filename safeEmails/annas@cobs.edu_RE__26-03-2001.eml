See, I knew it!  You always assume the worst when really the reasoning was
kind of flattering - he thinks so highly of you that he doesn't want you to
see him upset.  I think that's a valid excuse, I'm totally the same way.
The other night I bagged on Nathan's dinner party, which I really wanted to
go to, because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first
cocktail.  You know what that's like, to be working so hard that you don't
feel like yourself.  Anyway, I'm glad it all worked out!

Michelle and I went out with Monica, John, Amber, Marky and John's brother
Mark on Saturday night.  It was so insane.  First of all, I was already
exhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar, regardless
of my 8am shift at Starbucks the next morning.  Then when we went to
Nathan's bar, Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead, knocking the odd garbage can
over along the way.  So they got to the bar before me, and they found Nathan
because Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing, and Amber was
like "Are you Anna's boyfriend?".  Thanks.  He was really cool about it
though, even though I think it caught him off guard.  I had to explain to
him that I NEVER used the word boyfriend, but he said he was flattered so it
was cool.  We were such an odd group: Amber and Marky were dancing with no
equilibrium, Monica's boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained
mute, Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar
cousin.  I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again,
but yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant, and we had
wine and two courses and dessert.  It was so great!  And some of his friends
came and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the
whole time.  He is SO GREAT!!!!  I don't know how accurate of a description
I am giving you, but I have never been so happy with a boy before.  He is
funny and cute and he loves wine and food.  Anyway, that's my deal.  Oh, and
Dad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow, but he called from
the Grand Canyon (I'm so jealous) and said my car is a "beautiful" champagne
colored Corolla.  I'm a little worried, but he said it's like new so I'm
sure it'll be great.

I think that on your next payday, you should put a bid on priceline.com for
a ticket here.  We would have so much fun!  Or you could even go through
mom's travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance - she said it
was only about $200 if you do it that way.  Of course, the later you come,
the sunnier it will be.  Anyway, I REALLY want you to visit!  And Monica
does, too.

Okay, keep me updated on the Dave situation - he sounds like boyfriend
material.  You should call me soon! (303) 777-7132, in case you lost it.

Love, Anna

Subject: RE:



Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is
though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee!
Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to
watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply
to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....

I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say
anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me
blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then
rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to
hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend
and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand
the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not
fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the
verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with
Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then
Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it
home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very
successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take
one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30.
Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me
there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill,
Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very
complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer
with "us." I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up
some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move,
because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me
and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At
about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's
psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya
think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work
and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in
such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd
reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something
instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed
and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and
finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was
over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his
balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now.
(that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help
me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere
along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing
that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June
because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did
the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories
when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes,
actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so
if you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just
that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess
what - I have to go. I'll call you tonight!

Take care,
kate

That sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running
Man, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If
anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any
of
your clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If
you think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which
your
demeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he
is
the stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the
same habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating
instances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And
being a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you
had the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.

Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.
I'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out
with you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we
know
you'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out
here, though.  It's about 67 degrees right now and it's 9:00 in the morning
on a day in March.  I can't believe how happy this sun makes me!  You would
love it, too.

Okay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks
he's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.  A stiff margarita will make
this whole problem a lot more manageable, don't you think?  You should go
have one.  Love you!

Luego,
Anna

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've
basically forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy
stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals
so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if
that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he
asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as
a rule, but this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and
actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so
livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish
work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying
at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi
cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by
yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna
