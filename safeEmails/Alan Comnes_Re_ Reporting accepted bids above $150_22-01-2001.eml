To all:

Greg's directive is that you need to let me know if any reportable trades=20
have occured.  This is a reminder that if any have occured for the week=20
ending 1/21/01 to please let me know by 10 a.m. PST Tues.

And just to clarify Greg's note:  I only need to be informed of bids above=20
$150/MWh  that were accepted.  I.e., we are not requred to report price-take=
r=20
bids or bids below $150/MWh, even if the market clears above that amount.
