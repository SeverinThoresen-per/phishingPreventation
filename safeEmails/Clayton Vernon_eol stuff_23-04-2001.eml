Vince-

I spoke with Tom, and I completely agree and would like to hand all this EOL=
=20
stuff over to you.

We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one=
=20
in his office he's not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to=20
Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its=20
database.

Martin's box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and=
=20
wouldn't mind giving it up.

In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody ove=
r=20
the data and any work you do with it. I needn't be involved, and you can kno=
w=20
your work is completely confidential.

I'll make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM=20
the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources=
=20
to finish the job. There is a fine Unix guy named Ben Thompson who will=20
support you, I'm sure.

Task:

1) Upgrade RAM on Martin's server
2) Install newest Solaris OS on server
3) Install Tibco and GNU software on server
4) Install SAS on server

Clayton
