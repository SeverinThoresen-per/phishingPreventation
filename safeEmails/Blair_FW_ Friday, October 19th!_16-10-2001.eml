I went to the eye doctor this morning and my left eye is looking great, bett=
er than he expected.  Since I am able to see 20/30 he decided to forego the =
temporary contact on my right eye and proceed with the surgery on the right =
eye.  He has scheduled me to have the Lasik surgery on my right eye this Fri=
day, the 19th. =20

If this causes a coverage problem, Robert has volunteered to come in early. =
 If there are any concerns please let me know.

Randy
