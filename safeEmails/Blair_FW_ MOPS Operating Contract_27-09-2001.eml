Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams r=
egarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item h=
as come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we ente=
r into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service fo=
r the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closin=
g to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into thei=
r back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue=
 to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulleti=
n Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and dow=
nstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG=
, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams e=
ntity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we w=
ould be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function=
 from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't ant=
icipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will=
 also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped=
, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between=
 NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them. =20

Thanks for your help.

Bob
