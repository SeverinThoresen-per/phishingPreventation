Alan and Richard, FYI re the FGPC/ECT contract.  John Lockey is a barrister=20
(an actual trial advocate) that David asked to help him given the urgency an=
d=20
complexity of this dispute.  Deborah, please print out and file.

=46rom David Best.

Following our telephone conference this morning, the following advice can be
given.  Please treat this advice as the joint advice of myself and Counsel=20
John
Lockey.  We give it in bullet form for the purposes of clarity.

1.   The terms of the ASTM D3605 do support the view that it is inappropriat=
e=20
to
apply D3605 to condensate.  The fact remains, however, that the contract=20
defines
the contractual specification by reference to D3605.  On the face of it, Enr=
on
has promised a specification in accordance with test method D3605 and has=20
agreed
to assume the risk tht the condensate does not satisfy the specification whe=
n
tested in accordance with D3605.

2.   The terms of Appendix 1 to the 1997 Fuel Supply Plan seem to us to make=
=20
it
much more difficult to argue that the reference in Appendix B of the contrac=
t=20
fo
D3605 means only that D3605 applies to condensate to the extent that it is
appropriate to use D3605 for condensate.  The fact that Enron reported test
results for condensate in Appendix 1 to the 1997 Fuel Supply Plan by referen=
ce
simply to test method D3605 makes it very difficult to argue that when the
parties concluded the contract, they would have had in mind that D3605 appli=
es
only to gasoil and would not apply (or would only apply with modifications) =
to
condensate.

3.   The terms of the Fuel Supply Plan,and of Appendix 1, make it even more
difficult to argue that the impossibility of finding a seller who is willing=
=20
to
sell condensate applying test method D3605 satisfies the test of using
reasonable commercial efforts.  Even though Enron is not contractually=20
committed
to the terms of the Fuel Supply Contract, the fact is that Enron put forward
typical specifications for condensate by reference to D3605.  The Fuel Suppl=
y
Plan re-emphasises the importance to the buyer of being provided with=20
condensate
in preference to naptha or gasoil.

4.   Our understanding of SGS' advice to Enron is that D3605 does not envisa=
ge
ashing, and that it would be wrong to report a result by reference to test
method D3605 if the sample had been ashed before testing.

5.   Should SGS provide a test certificate certifying a specification which =
is
outside contractual specification applying D3605with a notation that=20
condensate
falls outside the scope of D3605, (as they suggest), the buyers will still b=
e
able to reject because any verification is final, conclusive and binding on=20
the
parties, provided there is no manifest error.

6.   If it is the case that applying D3605 (without any modifications to the
ASTM methodology) to portions of the sample condensate provided to the
independent inspector would (or may well) produce different results (in ppm)=
=20
for
the same sample because of the volatility of condensate, it seems to us to b=
e
strongly arguable that the independent inspector (aware that his certificati=
on
of non-compliance will be binding under the contract) should simply refuse t=
o
certify a test result by reference to D3605.  It seems to us to be difficult=
=20
in
those circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test=20
result
is reliable.  (Furthermore, if it is the case that it is not practically
possible to certify quantities of elements below 0.5ppm using D3605 on
condensate, then again the independent inspector should refuse to certify at
those levels).

7.   If the independent inspector refuses to certify by reference to D3605,=20
the
buyer will have to decide whether to reject and take his chances of
demonstrating that in fact the condensate was off-spec by reference to D3605=
=2E
(The absence of a certificate of compliance with specification does not seem=
=20
to
us to justify rejection).  If the buyer decides to reject, an arbitrator wou=
ld
have to decide on all the evidence whether the cargo was off-spec as measure=
d=20
by
D3605.  The buyer would be running the risk that he could not justify the
rejection, with a potential exposure to Enron's costs.  It would be prudent =
in
those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using=20
D3605
methodology in order to present an average (and hopefully on-spec) result to
counteract the test results produced by the buyer.  It would also be prudent=
=20
in
those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using=20
SGS'
preferred method of testing condensate, as these results could be used by=20
Enron
to require the buyer to take a rejected cargo in mitigation of the buyer's=20
loss
or to submit to the arbitrators that the buyer should have mitigated by
accepting re-tender of the rejected cargo when accompanied by an independent
inspector's certification that the specs were met by reference to the much=20
more
appropriate methods for testing.

8.   Contractually, it is almost certainly not open to Enron to refuse to=20
agree
on the appointment of an independent inspector, or to insist that the
independent inspector should not test the sample of condensate using method
D3605 unless there are modifications to that method when applied to=20
condensate.
However, there does not appear to be any objection to Enron advising in=20
advance
that because the independent inspector's certificate is intended to be bindi=
ng
under the contract, the independent inspector should not provide a result by
reference to D3605 unless satisfied that that result is truly representative=
=20
of
the qualities of the sample.

9.   Turning to Enron's exposure to a tax liability on the nomination and
shipment of gasoil we repeat our advice given in our e mail of 2nd August th=
at
it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success
that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell
condensate applying test method D3605 satisfies the test of using reasonable
commercial efforts to justify zero tax.  It seems to us that this provision =
is
designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force
majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into.  The onus =
is
on Enron to demonstrate that it has used reasonable commercial efforts.  It =
is
likely in our view that FGCP will set off against price a sum equivalent to=20
the
tax liability so that Enron is out of pocket with the regard to the nominate=
d
gasoil.

10.  Unless Enron wishes to manage the contract by risking a rejection dispu=
te
each time condensate is delivered (assuming SGS do not certify) Enron may wa=
nt
try to renegotiate the contract.  It may be that the point we have raised in=
 7
concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in=20
any
such renegotiation.

Regards


David Best
