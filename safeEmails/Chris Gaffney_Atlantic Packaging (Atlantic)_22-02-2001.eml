Mark/Peter - Enron Canada ("ECC") is contemplating entering into physical=20
transaction to supply power to Atlantic.  It is contempated to be a 3 year=20
deal for 25-50 MWh and will be back to backed with the British Energy supply=
=20
contract.  ENA currently has an existing pulp and paper swap with Atlantic=20
which was done under an ENA/Atlantic ISDA.  Enron credit has reviewed=20
Atlantic and has advised that in order for ECC to do the power deal it will=20
need to put into place a master netting and collateral agreement.  I have=20
reviewed a form of master netting and collateral agreement that ECC has used=
=20
where there is a master physical and an ISDA between the same two parties bu=
t=20
not where there are three parties.  Do either of you have such a three party=
=20
form?  I was thinking we may have this in Houston to the extent we have=20
entered into this type of arrangement in power deals (i.e. among EPMI, ENA=20
and the counterparty).

This issues that arise in the current situation are complex given that:
Governing Law - the physical agreement will be governed by Ontario law and=20
the ISDA is likely governed by New York Law.  the master netting agreement=20
would likely be governed by Ontario law;
Sharing - there will need to be a concept of sharing/obligations between ENA=
=20
and ECC (for all situations, both in the money, both out of the money and on=
e=20
of each);
Currencies - Not overly complex but will need to be addressed as betwee ENA=20
and ECC as well as with the counterparty.


If either of you have any thoughts on the contemplated agreement please let=20
me know.

Regards
CJG
