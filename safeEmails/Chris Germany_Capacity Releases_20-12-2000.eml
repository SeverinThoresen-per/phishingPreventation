I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity. =20
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years=20
provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is=20
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines=20
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.
