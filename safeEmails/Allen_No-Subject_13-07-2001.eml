Michael,

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfo=
rtunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  T=
he two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationsh=
ip were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax in=
terfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the servic=
es that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against ves=
ted options. =20

It was worth a try.

Phillip
