Dear Friend,

A friend of yours, Bonnie Abraham, just took the Spiritual Gifts Analysis
Test at the Church Growth Institute web site. Your friend thought it was
very valuable and wanted to tell you about this unique FREE service!

Point your browser to the following web address, take the Spiritual Gifts
Analysis Test, and within minutes you'll know your dominant spiritual
gift and what you can do with it to minister to others. Here's the address:

http://www.teamministry.com/

I do hope you'll take advantage of this unique opportunity to learn about
yourself and how the Lord has gifted you!

Sincerely,

Larry Gilbert

President, Church Growth Institute

PS: Here's what your friend wanted to say to you:

Dana, Here is another inventory that I have taken in the past.
It's a very good one. Let me know what you think. BA=20
