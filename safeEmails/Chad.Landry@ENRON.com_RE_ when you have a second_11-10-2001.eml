Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans:

Saturday morning:  70% chance of showers and thunderstorms.  Some strong to =
severe with heavy rain possible.

Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with h=
eavy rain likely.

Saturday late afternoon:  Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering s=
howers. =20

Saturday evening and night:  Clearing skies.

That is the best I can come up with right now.  Front is moving through on S=
aturday and it is all based on timing.  If the front slows down or speeds up=
, then of course it will greatly change the forecast.  My guess is that the =
front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late af=
ternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky.

Hope this helps.

Jay
