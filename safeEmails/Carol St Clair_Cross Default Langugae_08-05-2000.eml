Jeff:
Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this=20
since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the=20
Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My=20
objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this=20
language and that this deal does not create a new standard.
Carol
