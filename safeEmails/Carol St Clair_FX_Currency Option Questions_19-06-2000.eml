Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following=20
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6. =20
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any=20
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option=
=20
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. =20
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do=20
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as =
a=20
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any=
=20
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed? =20
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating=
=20
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Carol
