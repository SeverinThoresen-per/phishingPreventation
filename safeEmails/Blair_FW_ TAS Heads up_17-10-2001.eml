Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and t=
he SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge ra=
tes to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't l=
ikely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and=20
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new=
 rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correc=
tly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late=
 "preliminary" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an ord=
er from FERC.
