I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified=
,=20
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to=
=20
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next=20
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so lon=
g=20
as we have any reason to believe that they will continue to be in some level=
=20
of operation requiring some level of gas purchases.  John, any comments.

So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I jus=

bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that an=
d=20
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probabl=

sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the=20
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the=20
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last=20
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next=20
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back=20
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas=20
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the=20
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase=
=20
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher tha=
t=20
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that=
=20
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the=20
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and=20
trueup each month for the prior months activity. =20

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for=20
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we stil=
l=20
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  Th=
e=20
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the=20
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck
