Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she=20
will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working ou=
r=20
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.

On that - just a couple of other things to mention.

1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which=
=20
is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she=
=20
was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday -=20
invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is please=
d=20
with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make the=
m=20
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlie=
r=20
- just an observation.

2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people=20
short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest.

3. EnFiber - our valuation/risk management engine (a cannabilised version of=
=20
EnPower) is up and running - and live.

Hope you are well.
