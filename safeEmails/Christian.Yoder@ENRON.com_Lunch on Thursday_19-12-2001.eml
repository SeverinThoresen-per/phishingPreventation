Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday=
 at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter "we" or "our" or =
"us" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily,=
 be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have =
already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by j=
oining us in the meal ("Lunch") you will not be exposed to any retroactive c=
law-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigati=
ng the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beve=
rage ("Beer") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company=
's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Boa=
rd which is being sought on an expedited basis.      =20

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons:=20

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous=
 New Year.

Christian and Steve     =20
