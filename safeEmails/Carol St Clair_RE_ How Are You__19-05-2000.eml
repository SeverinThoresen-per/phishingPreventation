Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?

 Scott and Andrea are having a baby! So I'll be a grandmother in
November. The first draft is on the web--a sonogram.

 How about June 5 - 8 any day for lunch?  Pam

Pam:
How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got
about
another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over
with.  I
hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  Are you
free
for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  E-mail me
back
with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said
hi.

Carol
