buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines. =
=20
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so=20
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out=20
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Tal=
