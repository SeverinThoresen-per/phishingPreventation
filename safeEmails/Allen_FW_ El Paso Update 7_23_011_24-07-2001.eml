Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and =
approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso=
 permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. T=
herefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company =
will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably =
grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in t=
he time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its re=
view.
