Hi Chris: We are in the process of acquiring bids for Natural gas for one
year term on a fixed price basis. The estimated volume is 11,000 mmbtu/day
at better than 90% use factor.
We have contacted three bidders including Enron. If you are interested we
can  include you in the bidding process. The purpose is to prepare for the
Powerhouse start-up and possible start-up of the San Manuel Mine & Smelter
in the near future. This is possible but not sure yet. We may know in next 3
to 5 weeks.
Thank you .............. Vito
