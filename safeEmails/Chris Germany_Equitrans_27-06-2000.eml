Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans=20
market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas int=
o=20
CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You=20
should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.


You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo=
).

thanks
