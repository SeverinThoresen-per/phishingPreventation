Hi Jeff!

I didn't know where else to direct my question, so you are the lucky one!  P=
eriodically, I receive books/updates from West Publishing (Westlaw people) f=
or our law library.  Previously, I was giving these to Keegan.  With Keegan =
and Barbara no longer here, I am not sure what to do about these books and u=
pdates.  Help!

Signed,
Glad to Still Be Here
