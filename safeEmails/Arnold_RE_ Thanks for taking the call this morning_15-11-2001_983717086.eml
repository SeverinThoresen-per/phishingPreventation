John,

Thanks for taking my call this morning and giving me the lay of the
land.  You mentioned the fact that there are a couple of HeadHunting
firms out there that are doing some business on the Trading side...do
you have any idea what firms those are so I can do some checking around
to see what they are all about etc....

Any other ideas you might have would be appreciated.

Thanks again for the time.  I do appreciate it....
