Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were imple=
mented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professiona=
l services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to =
follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below:

Travel and Business Expenses

=B7	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority. =
 Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by usi=
ng ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <h=
ttp://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park=
 ("TAP") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel ag=
ency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should =
all use.

ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options f=
or their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees =
in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most cur=
rent information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, Clic=
kTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enab=
led personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.

When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach ticket=
s when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than re=
fundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.

=B7	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number =
of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental com=
panies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.co=
m>.

=B7	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-r=
elated expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account =
reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>.

=B7	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more th=
an 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transpor=
tation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311.

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713)=
 646-8311. =20


Professional Services

To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service ex=
penditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, =
information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negoti=
ated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 =
must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please subm=
it all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry =
or me for business unit approval. =20

To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services R=
equisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line=
 at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or =
by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Servic=
es Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329.
   =20
Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, =
in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Bu=
ilding.

As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additio=
nal cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>. =20

If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Seni=
or Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024. =20
