I just spoke with Elizabeth Brown and she said the agreements have been "int=
entionally" billed as 2-part, knowing they are actually 1-part agreements.  =
Billing as a 1-part would require a significant amount on manual interventio=
n on the Commodity paths by the Gas Logistics group.  This 2-part process ha=
s been used for these agreements for quite some time.  It is unlikely we wou=
ld change the billing method at this point but are willing to discuss furthe=
r if you desire.

E.B.,

	Can you change the flag in CBS to show contracts as 1-part agreements?  Mic=
helle Lokay and Jeanette Doll said an ECT (K# 24654) and a Enervest (K# 2456=
4) agreement are flagged (incorrectly) as 2-parts.  I pulled up the original=
 text in Envision and they are indeed 1-part agreements.  Can you help?  I n=
