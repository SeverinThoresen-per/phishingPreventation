Subject:	FW: Activity Rates for 2002

The ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates were set at th=
e time of the SAP go live, in July 2000.  With the labor true-up process in =
place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end th=
e standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual.  D=
uring the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.  Fro=
m an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting feature of =
SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being utilized =
to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will always =
exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will limit the =
variance.

My recommendation is that if adjustments are made they should be coordinated=
 at the ETS consolidated level.  At the time of the SAP implementation Allis=
on Milan conducted a study across the different companies and Accounting set=
 the rates with the participation of HR.  Since going live with SAP the inte=
grity of the ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates and t=
heir application to all cost centers has not been maintained because there i=
s not central control point for this process.

Theoretically they should now be off by the merit increase in 2001.  Each ye=
ar at merit time would be the logical time to make adjustments to the rates.=
  An option would be to wait until 2002 merit time and make adjustments base=
d on 2001 and 2002 merit results.  It would also be a good time to synchroni=
ze all of the ETS "F" cost centers with the same rates.

If I can provide any additional help, please let me know.  Thanks.

All,


This is a follow-up to the email sent several weeks ago concerning activity =
rate planning for 2002. =20

I have begun the process of copying the existing rates planned for December =
of 2001 to all periods in 2002.   I am currently thru period 5, 2002 and exp=
ect to be complete with period 6, 2002 by late today.

Requested actions:

1.  After we are complete it will be the responsibility of each business uni=
t to go in and confirm data and nofity me of any issues.  I expect to be com=
plete by Wednesday of next week which will give you at least a month to revi=
ew.

2.  Also, please notify me if there are any additional changes to the primar=
y and secondary contact list for your business unit.  I have made the change=
s that I have received at this point and the current distribution reflects t=
hose changes.



Look for a note from me next week that signals completion of the data copy. =
 If you would like to begin reviewing data thru period 5 please do so.

Thanks, Paul

Call me with any questions at ext 55013.
