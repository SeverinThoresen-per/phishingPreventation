You obviously know far more than me....but I was just reading the following:

        THE LATE-SEASON storm has killed at least four people from Colombia
to Dutch St. Maarten in the northeast Caribbean.
       On Tuesday, two fishermen drowned off Colombia=0F's Caribbean peninsu=
la,
and rains destroyed half of a coastal village, leaving 540 people homeless.
       One man died in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, after he fell off
a ladder as he tried to board up windows. A man in St. Maarten died
Wednesday when the garden wall of his hillside home collapsed on him.
       The hurricane was unlikely to strike the mainland United States, said
meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. He
cautioned, however, that Lenny still could bring heavy surf capable of
eroding beaches in Florida.
       =0F"The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable
distances away,=0F" he said.

       In St. Croix, an unidentified tourist who ventured out of a hotel to
see the rising surf was carried away by waves and had to cling to a rock for
more than an hour before local divers rescued him, said Gov. Charles
Turnbull of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
       Even before the hurricane arrived, storm surges that whipped up
12-foot waves stripped sand from Anguilla=0F's famous beaches. The beaches,
which attract tourists who provide the British island=0F's biggest source of
revenue, already had been damaged by Hurricane Jose last month.
       Nearly 100 tourists had to be evacuated from a flooded hotel to
another hotel on higher ground in Anguilla.

A SEEMINGLY BACKWARD STORM
       Hurricane Lenny is a late-season storm with a seemingly backward
trajectory from west to east that surprised even seasoned forecasters.
       Feeding off the warm Caribbean waters, Lenny=0F's winds strengthened =
to
150 mph Wednesday, just 5 mph short of being a Category 5 hurricane, the
strongest hurricane rating. Category 5 hurricanes can cause catastrophic
damage. By Thursday morning, the storm had weakened to 135 mph.

           In San Juan, a few motorists speeded down highways usually choked
with traffic and tooted their horns with delight that the storm, which
zigzagged on a course that confounded meteorologists, had missed them. But
nearly 100,000 people remained without water or electricity Wednesday night.
       The eye of the storm was expected to pass close to the Dutch
territories of St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, Saba and the British island of
Anguilla.
       Anguilla was drenched by 4 to 6 inches of rain in four hours
Wednesday afternoon, and its beaches were eroded by sea swells of up to 12
feet throughout the day.
       The storm=0F's first winds cut power and telephone service to many ho=
mes
in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The hurricane ripped up trees and
unleashed a steady rain that flooded large areas.
       The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent medical teams to
the Virgin Islands ahead of the storm. The agency=0F's director, James Lee
Witt, told reporters that damage assessors would fly in today.
       He said that while the hurricane damaged roofs, including that of the
national armory, he did not expect widespread damage because FEMA had helped
the government institute new hurricane building codes after Hurricane
Marilyn devastated the islands in 1995.
       The territory has a $1 billion debt and still owes $8 million for
federal disaster loans from Hurricane Marilyn and Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

RUINOUS WAVES
       Waves smashed over the 8-foot sea wall at Frederiksted, the
second-largest town on the island, tearing away the wooden pier that was the
fish market and a small part of the concrete pier where cruise ships dock.
       In Christiansted, St. Croix=0F's main town, the boardwalk was submerg=
ed,
and winds tore part of the roof off the newly renovated King Christian
Hotel.
       The storm beached and sunk boats from Aruba, off Venezuela=0F's coast=
 in
South America, to Grenada and St. Kitts.
       On St. Kitts=0F' concrete pier, a half dozen people suffered fracture=
s
and other injuries when they were hit by waves. Storm surges in Grenada
swept away four houses, washed away asphalt roads, damaged runway lights at
the airport and flooded roads and the business district.
       Turnbull said Wednesday he was waiting for President Clinton to
declare St. Croix a disaster area, making it eligible for federal emergency
funds.
