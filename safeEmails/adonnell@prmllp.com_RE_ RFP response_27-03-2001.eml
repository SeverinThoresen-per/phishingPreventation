Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for
gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.
As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert
to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The  options  presented  are  not  intended to represent a complete list of
opportunities,  but  are representative of the different pricing structures
Enron  offers.   There  are several additional structures available  and we
look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination
