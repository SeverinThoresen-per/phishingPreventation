	Britt, I scheduled a meeting per Drew's request with my team that deals wit=
h the
	Bushton area.  Drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful =
about
	using the term "PTR calculation" for measurement error adjustments.  We tho=
ught
	it would be good for you to attend as well.  I want the team to understand =
how
	important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about B=
ushton
	issues.  Hopefully you can attend.  Although I think the meeting may be sch=
eduled
	to 10:00 a.m. instead of 9:30.  Hopefully that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn
