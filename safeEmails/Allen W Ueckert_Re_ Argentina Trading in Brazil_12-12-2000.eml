#4 -  I would expect that to the extent you continue to have activity in=20
Argentina, especially Arcor, that it would be wise to keep one accounting=20
person in BA.  We currently do not have anyone in SP that has both Brazil an=
d=20
Argentine statutory accounting experience.  I also believe that it would be=20
somewhat difficult to find a person which would have this experience in=20
Brazil.  Finally, since we already have someone in BA that understands the=20
system and the business, it just makes sense, from a learning curve=20
perspective,  to keep one of the current staff.

#1 - From an accounting point of view, the mechanics would not be a problem=20
as we have SAP in SP as well, which is tied into Houston and BA.  However,=20
the bigger problem, staffing to handle this,  is addressed above.

Let me know if you need further clarification.

1 What are the tax,  legal, regulatory, accounting and operational=20
consequences of this move?

2 Are there any commercial restrictions I need to be aware of?

3 Are there any barriers to payments and receivable management?=20

4 Could accounting be managed out of Brazil?=20

5 Are there any Argentine banking requirements that would require the=20
payables and receivable function to remain in Argentina?

6 Are there any conflicts with Brazilian law or banking regulations?

7 Is there any additional taxation exposure such as in  the case of the US a=
s=20
we decrease Argentina functional independence?

8 Are there any Argentine regulatory conflicts with operating out of Brazil?

9 Are there any Argentine legal conflicts with operating out of Brazil?

10 How do we and can we operate Enron America del Sur S.A. and Enron=20
Comercializadora de Energia S.A. out of Brazil?

12 If necessary what functions need to remain in Argentina to resolve any=20
legal, regulatory, accounting or tax issues?

13 Can the stack managers be live in both Argentina and Brazil to resolve an=
y=20
identified issues?=20

14 Are there any legal or tax advantages to the Brazilian operational=20
structure?

15 Mostly are there any fatal flaws I need to be aware of?

Under this structure the stack managers for the following current and future=
