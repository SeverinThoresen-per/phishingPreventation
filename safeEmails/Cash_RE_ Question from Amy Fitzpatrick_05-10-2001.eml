No risk to non-compete.  The payment obligation is one that is independent o=
f non-compete.  MHC

Subject:	Question from Amy Fitzpatrick

Holly Krebbs left Enron (Portland). She had a 3-month evergreen and was supp=
osed to be paid her salary through that 90-day period.  Due to a computer gl=
itch, Holly got terminated from payroll and did not receive a regular payche=
ck from August 8 through September 26.  As soon as Holly made Amy aware of t=
he situation (Sept. 26), Irma got the computer records corrected and request=
ed a check to pay monies due. The employee was sent a check via Federal Expr=
ess.

Amy is concerned that we may have somehow "breached" the settlement agreemen=
t which would allow Holly to ignore her obligations re non-compete.  Is the =
non-compete still in effect as long as she got the money, even if it wasn't =
paid on time?=20

We know Holly is going to AEP at the end of the 90-day evergreen and Amy has=
 already had to remind her of her non-compete obligations because Holly was =
seen lunching with an AEP executive.

Is there a risk here re non-compete?

Thanks....
