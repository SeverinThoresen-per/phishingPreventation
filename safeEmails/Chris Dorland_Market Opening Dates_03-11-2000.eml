Subject: Market Opening Dates

Hey Chris,

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets=20
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power=
=20
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP=
)=20
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me=
=20
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig=
=20
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with=20
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

Dan
