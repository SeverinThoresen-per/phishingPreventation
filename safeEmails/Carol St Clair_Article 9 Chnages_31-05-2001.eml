David:
Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it=20
something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt=20
the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's=20
primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by=20
possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that=
=20
we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze=
=20
let's talk first.  Thanks.=20
