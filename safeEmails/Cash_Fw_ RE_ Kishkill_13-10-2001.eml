Michelle,

Joe has caved in on the home leave issue.  We only need to add the following=
 to Exhibit A at the end of the Repatriation and Related items section:

"The items described above must be used within the six-month non-competition=
 period; after that time, they will be forfeited.  If household goods are to=
 be shipped to Argentina, Employee will have until May 15, 2002 to provide f=
or duty free importation of goods into Argentina.  Additional time will be a=
llowed where Enron must provide documents for duty free import of goods into=
 Argentina."

Change Furniture Storage from reimbursed to Provided.

Once we resolve 7.9 and 7.10 below, he'll sign.

Tim

Michelle,

Discussed the latest draft separation agreement with Joe today.  He has just=
 a couple more questions.

1.	Article 7.9 was adjusted to add the first sentence, which references arti=
cles of the employment agreement.  He wants to know the intent of this addit=
ion.  Also, article 4.4 is referenced and there is no 4.4 in the employment =
agreement.

2.	Article 7.10 - He is still concerned about the situation where Enron is a=
cquired by a company where he was employed.  I explained to him that such a =
situation would not fall under "rehire" by Enron.  However, he would like th=
e last sentence to read, "This provision would not apply if Employee is empl=
oyed by an entity that may be acquired by or acquires a Company after the ef=
fective date of this agreement."

These are all the items for you.  I'm still haggling with him over home leav=
e and timing on shipment of goods.  Let me know your thoughts on the above a=
nd I think I can get him to agree to some terms that we can finalize.
