Email the sheet to me for now.  I am going to try to set up another export p=
rocess later.  You can just replace East and West on your sheet with US.  Ca=
nada Power has done their part, but I have not received anything from Canada=
 Gas.  Any assistance on your side would be helpful.

Thanks,
Chris

The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deal=
s we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all posi=
tions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books b=
ut we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perfor=
m on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional=
 columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall =
I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file fo=
r these to be saved into?
Is Canada doing their part?

Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7=
,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East a=
nd West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter f=
rom 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l nu=
mbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris
