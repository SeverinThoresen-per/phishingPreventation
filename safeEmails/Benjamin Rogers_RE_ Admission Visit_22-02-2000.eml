 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, than=
k=20
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application=20
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty an=
d=20
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to=
=20
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the=20
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be=
=20
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my=20
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as th=
e=20
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have=
=20
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie.=20
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the=20
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School. =20
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and=20
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living i=
n=20
Texas, such as myself. =20

Regards,

Ben Rogers
