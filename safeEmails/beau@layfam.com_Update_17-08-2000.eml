Per our meeting today, I spoke with Sherrie about  lines of credit at=20
(PaineWebber) PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little=
=20
bit of cushion.? I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loa=
n=20
to value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in=20
that department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number=20
moves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the=20
time she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her=20
that we should have that updated once a  week.
?
I also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against th=
e=20
PW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for=20
some of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5=20
million so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed=20
at 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion=20
that is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said=
=20
it would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.
?
With regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that=
=20
he can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20=20
basis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.
?
I have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided t=
o=20
be by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work o=
n=20
what they have?been providing to me.? I  have not been impressed with the=20
last couple of reports he has produced so that  is why you haven't seen=20
them.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense  gone out and purchased a better=20
system for that purpose.
?
I also told him that I would like an update on the  performance reports that=
=20
are run on managers, specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include=20
managers that invest in Latin America.?  I though it would be good, since=20
Robert Day of TCW has been positive about  that?geographic area.
?
With regards to any future selling of personal  Enron stock, Rocky recommend=
s=20
selling within your?retirment plan since the  taxes are deferred and=20
diversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed accounts here.? I=20
inquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any additional choices=
=20
to be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people at Enron who=20
handle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I don't know if=
=20
that meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper management?
to  make it happen.
?
I know that Sherrie is working her tail off to try  and get you the July=20
Financials before your trip.? I know she is planning  on staying late to get=
=20
it completed.? I told her that you want them before  you depart on your trip=
=20
tomorrow.
?
I think that that is all for now.
