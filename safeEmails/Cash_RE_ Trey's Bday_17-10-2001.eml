DVDs would be good.  I got him the Godfather Trilogy, but you might consider=
 other movies. =20
He has Playstation 2, so games are a good idea.
He always likes short-sleeved, solid color polo shirts in size XL.
His Rice Owls baseball cap got mutilated when the baggage cart ran over his =

Hope those ideas help.
