	I apologize for this e-mail being so late.  I know that probably someone ha=
s already sent in an email with this comment, especially during the time 	yo=
u requested the employees let you know how we could all pull together to imp=
rove the outlook that the outside world has on Enron.  I had a 	gentleman on=
 our floor a few weeks back, that told me he had worked for Enron a while ba=
ck, he said the most damaging thing that hurts Enron in 	the public eye, is =
the fact that a person can seldom talk to the same person in a department mo=
re than a few times before their contact in that 	department moves to anothe=
r department or leaves. He said it gives the public a feeling of insecurity =
in trusting a company where the employees 	move around so much. I hope this =
doesn't upset you, I just thought I would let you know what one gentlemen to=
ld me regarding the company. I 	absolutely love the foundation that you have=
 built Enron on, and I only hope that more company's follow suit. Have a won=
derful day.=20
