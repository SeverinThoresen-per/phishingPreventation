According to sources, El Paso's (Coastal's) 290kb/d refinery was entirely sh=
ut about two weeks ago after a power failure.  Among the units shut are a cr=
ude unit, two large hydrotreaters and two cokers.  Only one crude unit and a=
 few small hydrotreaters are currently running, bringing total refinery outp=
ut to only 85kb/d.

Even before this incident, the refinery was running at a reduced rate of abo=
ut 160kb/d, awaiting the restart of a new visbreaker that burned in a fire l=
ast April.

As we understand it, the plan is to start heating one large hydrotreater ton=
ight and have it up and running in about 7 days, then the other will come up=
=2E After the first hydrotreater comes up, the other crude unit and the new =
visbreaker will restart.=20

In the shipping market, we hear they are long time-charters and reoffering. =
 Sources have also seen them buying jet into Boston as well as low-sulfur di=
esel/jet off the USGC for Florida.

I was out of the loop last week, but I don't think this outage has been repo=
rted as of this afternoon.  Apologies if it has been.
