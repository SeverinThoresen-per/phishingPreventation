	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I revie=
wed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the n=
ew Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  =
She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and =
has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market con=
ditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive=
 even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have m=
ischaracterized what you said.

	I see two options:

	1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best=
 to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't=
, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about g=
etting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.

	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can fr=
om F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon o=
r so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.

	Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may=
 not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will =
probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested En=
ron attorneys. =20

	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning w=
hat our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact=
 her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and=
 have them be ready to hit the ground running.

	If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.

	I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.

	Britt
