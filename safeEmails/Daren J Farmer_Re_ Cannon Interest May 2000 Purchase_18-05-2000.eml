Hi Daren,
I received an email from Kenny Soignet to make sure everything was in the=20
system for me to pay Cannon on Friday, 5/19/00.
The deal # is 257141.  I see that the volume has not been scheduled, so=20
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay. =20
Are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me=20
to pull up this deal?
( I see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5/00 production, does that=20
matter? )

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
