Hello Lindy Lou! How are you doing? Are you holding up? I was so glad to tal=
k with you about how things were affecting you. You amaze me in how you are =
so objective and practical about the whole thing. Your concern is not for yo=
urself but others who are older have less time before retirement. You are so=
 thoughtful. But I have known that. I was sorry you felt so bad about the Co=
mpany. You have worked for a great company that has been successful and good=
 for the country let alone the oil market economy. This mismanagement is not=
 a reflection on all the very very hard working honorable people who made th=
e company what it is today. Like you and 99.9999% of the people involved. I =
just wanted to tell you I love you and was thinking about you today. I took =
Claire to get tested for allergies today. What a sad thing they poked her 18=
 times. She is allergic to cats and has a propensity to be allergic to the h=
ampsters we have so the doc limited her contact with them. The cat allergy i=
s!
 a problem because our sitter who watches her 3-4 afternoons a week has a ca=
t. This lady-Carol is a Godsend. I think Claire's own grandparents couldn't =
care for her as good as this lady. She is like a member of the family. So, I=
 don't know what we'll do about the allergy situation. You know how hard it =
is to find someone you trust to care for your child. I told Claire we could =
go anywhere for lunch since she was crying with the "multiple Pokes" to her =
skin and then I got paged to Adam's school that he had a fever and wanted to=
 come home. So, I am in the Mommie mode today. Somedays I think it would be =
good to be home all the time. But, we'd have to move. Well, I'm just ramblin=
g on-imagine that! I hope you have a good day! Write back and let me know ho=
w Sam, Tony, Missy, Andrew, Anthony and of course YOU are!=20
