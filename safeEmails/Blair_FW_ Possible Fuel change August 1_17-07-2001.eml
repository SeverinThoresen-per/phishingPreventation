Raetta - Could you please forward this to everyone in market services?
Rosemary - Could you please forward this to everyone in Marketing?

As you may already know, on July 10, NNG again filed with FERC to update our=
 fuel rates in line with our annual PRA
(docket RP01-395).  We filed the same rates that were set up for June 1, the=
n pulled when FERC suspended them for 5 months, pending a Technical Conferen=
ce.  The new filing asks for the rates to be effective August 1 and has requ=
ested FERC approval by July 27 to facilitate early nominations for August bu=
siness.  After discussing the rate changes with our customers, we are hopefu=
l that the latest filing will be approved.

I do not expect to update the Rate Matrix on the EBB or to load the rates in=
to the system until we receive FERC approval.
The next FERC meeting is Wednesday, July 25. =20

If customers want to see the proposed rates, they can consult our Tariff, sh=
eets 54 (fuel & UAF), 54A (exception points), and 61-64 (transport fuel) on =
the EBB under "Proposed" with Effective Date "August 1, 2001".
