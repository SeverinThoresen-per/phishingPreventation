Ercot Traders-

We will be going live in the Curve Manager for Ercot on Monday, November 5th=
=2E  Ercot South (R6) will be your primary curve that you mark, and all othe=
rs will be dependent upon that curve.=20

I know the first few days will be a learning experience, so when you are rea=
dy to mark the curves just let me know and I'll come sit with you guys.

Thanks!

Andrea
