Hey team.  I had every intention of being there this morning (even though I =
was running late) but my daughter was awake and  I couldn't resist spending =
time with her.  I'll be there next week.=20

Guys,
Joe informed me he cannot attend tomorrow AM and I'm assuming Chris is out u=
ntil further notice.
Scott and Lindsey - please let me know if you plan to attend.  I'm inclined =
to go ahead if you both can make it, or cancel if one of you cannot.

Thx!
Bill
