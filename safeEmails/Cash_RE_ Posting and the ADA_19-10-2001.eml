Happy to talk with you about the ADA -- I've actually written two papers on =
the topic and edited an article in The Houston Lawyer on your very topic (al=
beit several years ago, which was before the Supremes spoke on the issue).  =
On the Senior Specialist position, I am happy to discuss that with you as we=
ll.  Please get with my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 39402 to schedule a time=
 next week to talk.  Michelle

My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year st=
udent at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specia=
list.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than t=
he fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the ex=
pectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt effi=
ciency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any i=
nformation you may provide including both duties and necessary qualification=
s. =20

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future =
concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protectio=
ns they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addre=
ssed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved i=
n such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the A=
DA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I wo=
uld feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing =
at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss. =20

Thank you for your time,

Jim Little
