Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it'=20
The rise and fall of Houston decadence

HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampa=
nt, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steam=
ing up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houst=
on.
"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injurie=
s with a margarita.
"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was =
about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, mone=
y, all of it."
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has=
 wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. vers=
ion of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington =
and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's =
gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two e=
nergy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left b=
y the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in =
oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began =
building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron u=
nder the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated=
 his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to=
 the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed swe=
aters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention m=
orality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street =
banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business s=
chool graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to=
 choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward t=
hat Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of th=
e late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyo=
ne wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well a=
s laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held =
computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahama=
s or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike gla=
ciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing st=
ore by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived =
cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank," with semi-annual reviews=
 in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names =
flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers we=
re fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall=
 Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added=
=2E Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports =
cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches w=
ere the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees=
 were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly inces=
tuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron w=
as placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the wh=
ole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr.=
 Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selli=
ng their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while t=
hose further down believed the hype.
"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lo=
st his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's =
treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec=
=2E 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her fa=
mily also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in =
Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like =
many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
"Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We=
 are fighting for liquidity."
