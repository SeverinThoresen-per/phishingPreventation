I had a discussion with Mark Taylor, David Forster and Louise on Friday=20
concerning returned PA's.  Here is the process:   If a PA comes back signed=20
by the party we originally mailed it to, we can accept it and process it.  I=
f=20
a PA comes back from another party, we schould call the party we originally=20
mailed to and ask what the signatory parties role is (ie who is he/she and=20
what authority do they have).  Mark feels we should attempt to verify the=20
signatory parties responsibilities however one attempt will be sufficient. =20
Please keep good notes in the database (date, time of call, who you talked=20
to, etc.)  If you have any questions on this call me.

If we receive a PA signed by someone at a company, then that individual is=20
representing that they have the authority to do so (principle of ostensible=20
authority)

We should obviously be careful that the mailing address matches what is in=20
our database, but beyond that, no further checks should be required. Please=20
proceed with sending the ID's.

Thanks,

Dave

To date we have received a few PA's that have been signed by a person other=20
than the party we mailed to.  We have called the companies and verified=20
employment of the signatory parties.  (Called switchboard and requested part=
y=20
on the pretense that we had received their PA and would be processing right=20
away).  Pending your approval we will start issuing Login id's.  We=20
anticipate having the folders and envelopes on Mon or Tues.  We will wait=20
until we hear from you to start processing the PA's we have to date.
