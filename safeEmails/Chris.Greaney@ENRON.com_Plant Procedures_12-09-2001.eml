There is new information in our TEAM PROCEDURE BOOK ( The White Binder that =
has our lovely team picture on it) This information includes plant procedure=
s for locations that NNG does not have set control on. This is a guideline t=
hat the after hours / weekend rep can use as a reference when gas controls c=
alls with a problem. The phone numbers and contacts are up to date,  however=
 some of the plant names should be updated. I'll work on that part next. Joe=
 and I will also put this information in a common folder so the team can upd=
ate and can keep things current. This will be in the book tabbed "PLANT PROC=
EDURES" . remember these are locations NNG has no set control.

thanks,

Joe Linhart
