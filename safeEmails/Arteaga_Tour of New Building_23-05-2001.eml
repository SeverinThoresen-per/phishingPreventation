Hunter,=20

A tour of the new Enron Building has been set up for
Thursday at 3:30 pm.

As you know the building is still under construction and can be dangerous
for anyone.

For safety reasons, Only 8 people can go on this tour.  This tour
is only for people that really need to go, the building is not open
for anybody to just "sight-see".

This is the best I could do.  Let me know if you need details.

Besides you and Laura, let me know what other 6 people will be
going to this tour, so I can submit the names to Clark.

Thanks,
Rain
