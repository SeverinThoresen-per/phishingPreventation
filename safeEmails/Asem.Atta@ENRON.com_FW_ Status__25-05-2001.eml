Michael,

	Holden Salisbury, trader in our PDX office, seems to be having problems [em=
ails included below] with getting full access to the Foster project's applic=
ations. Seems that when he browses through his program menu's on his local m=
achine he sees only Oasis Net Exports and Transmission Ticker and when he go=
es through TerminalServer he's got access to all of them, he needs to be abl=
e to access all apps [ Transmission Ticker, Net Exports. Transmission Offeri=
ngs, Reservation Reports, Batch Scheduler, ATC reports] from his local machi=
ne.  IT IRM  contacts up on the Portland side are Chip Cox [503-703-0536] an=
d David Steiner [503-703-1553]. Please do let whomever know what needs to be=
 done in order to get this resolved.

thanks in advance

I need all of the Foster applications on my local profile.  I have some of t=
hem on local and some of them on my terminal server profile.  I need the sam=
e Foster profile that Diana Scholtes has on her local machine.  As of this m=
orning I still do not have it.  Please let me know when my profile gets upda=
ted.

Thank You,
Holden

Chip,

	The issue seems to be that of an Information Risk Management problem where =
they haven't pushed out all the application access to Holden's profile.. I h=
ad put in a ticket with (31411) under your name for this matter on Monday. I=
 will call them and ask them to escalate this matter.

regards
