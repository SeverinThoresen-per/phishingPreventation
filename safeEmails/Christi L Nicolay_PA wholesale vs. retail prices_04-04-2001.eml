I talked with Jim Steffes about the article below.  He stated that the PA=20
company most at risk for a California type problem is GPU because it has=20
divested its generation and will be in the market more.  (Maybe this creates=
=20
an opportunity for EPMI selling a hedge product to GPU?)

Tom Chapman--Do you have additional info or insights on this?  Thanks.

Today's Electric Power daily discusses that due to high wholesale power=20
prices, many PA customers are switching back to their utility that has cappe=
d=20
prices.  Does this create the potential for a California situation with the=20
utilities in PA?  I put in a call to Jim S too.  Thanks for your help.
