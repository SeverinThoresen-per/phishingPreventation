Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278. =20
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per=20
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They=20
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Thanks
