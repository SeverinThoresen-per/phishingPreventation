Hey Sara, Keegan stopped by my office right before lunch to indicate that yo=
u=20
had requested from her the updated brokerage list.  But reminder that I have=
=20
the updated list and have an updated version.  Reminder that Keegan will not=
=20
start updating the list until after today's meeting.  When I talked to Aneel=
a=20
by phone today, I gave her an update and reminded her that she would get a=20
formally updated list after today's meeting.  Also, as I indicated yesterday=
,=20
most of the agreements on the list -- the vast majority -- have been execute=
d.

I stopped by your office a few times but you seem to have gone to lunch so I=
=20
am leaving a version on your chair.
