All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a de=
al with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee =
at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You w=
ould be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kind=
er Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  T=
hey really need gas help.

Good Luck and stay in touch.

Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver. =20
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the =
unbelievable craziness here in Houston. =20
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Reso=
urces name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to s=
end him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy   =20
