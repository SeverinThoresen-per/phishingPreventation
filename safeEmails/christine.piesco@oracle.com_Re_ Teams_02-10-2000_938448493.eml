Jeff,

I appreciate your help. I sent a note to the Prof last week letting him know=
=20
your
concerns and asking him to verify once more that a group size of 5 was OK. I=
=20
got
his response today that it was. Apparently, my old group was the only one=20
with 3,
most of the others have at least 4. If there really is a lot of resistance I=
=20
will
ask the Professor to assign me randomly to a group. I would simply prefer to=
=20
join
one that I chose. I appreciate you're group's helping me out of this awkward=
=20
spot,
if they decide to let me in. Let me know,

Thanks,
Christine
