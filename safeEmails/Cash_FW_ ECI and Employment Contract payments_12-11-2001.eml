Mary Joyce/Michelle,
=20
I hope all is well with you. Rob Walls has asked me to contact you relating =
to the payments that Enron needs to make based on the ECI and my own Employm=
ent agreement.
=20
As I mentioned in my previous emails and messages these payments are late fo=
r a number of months now and it has become extremely URGENT from my standpoi=
nt that they are made immediately. I realise a lot is going on at Enron and =
that you must be very busy but this matter is really long overdue as well as=
 fairly simple so please let me know what I need to do or who at Enron I nee=
d to contact in order to receive the payments.
=20
Beginning Monday I can be contacted by email at diomedes@cumulouscapital.com=
  or by phone at my office in London (011-44-20-70728410). Today and tomorro=
w I can be contacted in Rioat the following numbers: 011-55-21-24957893/2491=
3777.
=20
I look forward to hearing from you,
=20
Regards,

Diomedes.
