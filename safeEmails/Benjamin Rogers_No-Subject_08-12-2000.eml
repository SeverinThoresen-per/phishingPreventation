Michael:
Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy=20
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that=20
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have=
=20
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you=20
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guy=
s=20
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle=20
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its=20
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't=20
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side. =20
Hope this helps.
Ben
