Vince,

Zimin and I talked briefly about the part-time work this morning. To recap;
I am willing to work 20 hours a week, however, I expressed my concern about
commuting every week. I asked if commuting once every two weeks (and work
out of Austin every other week) would be acceptable. As to the term of the
work, I suggested a 3-mo period (I have yet not talked to international
office which arranges work authorization using Curricular Practical Training
of which I have used up 9 months already), I might run into problems if I
ask for more. I also mentioned that I would do my best to accomodate your
preferences. We did not discuss any other details.

I shall be awaiting for your response on this matter.

Best,

 ---------oOOo-----oOOo----------
