Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the=20
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?
