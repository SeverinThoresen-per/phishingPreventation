Mr. Fleming:

Thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information.=
 Your letter indicated that I should make application through the Membership=
 Committee, who would provide me with an application. You copied Cmde. Roth =
on the letter so I will contact him to request an application or schedule a =
meeting. (I have no contact information for him other than through the PYC, =
is that appropriate?)=20

I found a potential slip at Great Cove Boat Club and was wondering if you ha=
d heard of this marina and if other members used this facility.

Thanks again for getting back to me.

Richard (Rick) Buy

P.S. I heard on the news one of the pilots was from Portsmouth. So tragic. I=
'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here.
