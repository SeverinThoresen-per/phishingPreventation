Today is CFO's Day.  A uniquely American concept, it is one that I personall=
y value the most.  It has no business justification, and is not tied to any =
shareholder value.  It does not spring from common sense and carries with it=
 very little baggage.  No value is received by the company; disclosures are =
few and spare; it reminds us that for senior management, there is little com=
mercial incentive not  to buy, travel, celebrate, or do anything to excess. =
 (The possible exceptions are the temptations to perform rationally or hones=
tly.)

CFO Day is a day specifically set aside to ponder our good fortune.  As most=
 of you know, it was first held in New England - a bountiful feast during wh=
ich the American forefathers stole money, land and resources from Native Ame=
ricans, appropriating their good harvest for their own ends.  Senior Managem=
ent celebrates this day still, to  remind us of the values which we must try=
 to make our own.

This is a very difficult time for all you left at Enron.  I want to take a f=
ew minutes of your time to share with you some of my thoughts - for even now=
, it is important to count our blessings and recall some of the many things =
for which we can be thankful.  I am thankful for the way all of you have sel=
flessly contributed to my retirement fund.  I am moved by the dollars many o=
f you have shared with me.  I have been impressed by your willingness to loo=
k forward, stay the course, ignore GAAP requirements, and maintain your stoc=
k purchase payments.  Your loyalty and naivety have sustained me during some=
 of my darkest moments.  I am grateful for friends, family, and the opportun=
ity to live and work in a free and open society, whereas by rights I should =
be living and working in an open prison.  Mostly, I am so very proud of you =
- your talents, your flexibility, your work ethic, your willingness to hang =
in there when things seemed to be spinning out of control.

Thanks for constantly reminding me how lucky I was to be working with such s=
uckers. =20
