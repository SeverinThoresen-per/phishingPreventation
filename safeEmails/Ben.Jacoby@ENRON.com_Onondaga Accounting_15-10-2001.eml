Louise:

In our meeting this week, I forgot to mention that we need to move the accou=
nting responsibility for Onondaga from the gas group over to Chris Sherman a=
nd Billy Fleenor. Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If =
you're ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.

Thanks and regards,
