Hi Karen and Monika,

I am working with Christopher de los Santos and Fariha Haque in looking at s=
ome of the drivers for the pulp market to structure a Decster for pulp-- one=
 thing that struck me at today's meeting was the looming threat of BEK.  I w=
ould like to get together with you to better understand the work you have do=
ne on the drivers as well as the view that we are developing for BEK.  Let m=
e know if you have some time tomorrow, I am wide open, and I will schedule a=
 room.  Thanks!
