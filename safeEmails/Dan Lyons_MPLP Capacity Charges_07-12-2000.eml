		 Subject: MPLP Capacity Charges

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL:

Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity=20
charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP:

Background

MPLP went into service on October 1, 1995 and provides service under a PPA=20
for a term that ends September 30, 2030.  Capacity charges are billed under=20
Section 10(a) of the PPA, which references a schedule of capacity rates=20
provided as Exhibit D.  Exhibit D:  (1) shows Consumers' avoided cost rates=20
for 35 years and (2) converts these rates into the specific rates applied=20
under Section 10(a).  Presumably, any QF that signed a contract with=20
Consumers for a facility due to go on line in 1995 would be subject to=20
payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule, although the way these=20
rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from=20
project to project (i.e., in the case of MPLP, the rates are "backloaded"=20
over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA).

Consumers', which "self-bills" under the PPA, began applying "Year 2"=20
capacity rates under Exhibit D on January 1, 1996 and implemented subsequent=
=20
increases on January 1 of 1997, 1998 and 1999.  January 1 rate increases wer=
e=20
not anticipated by the partnership.  However, there is no definition for=20
"contract year" under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by "Year" without=20
specific reference to what constitutes a "Year" (i.e., "contract year" vs.=20
"calendar year").  Based on Consumers' past actions, it would appear that=20
their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are=
=20
effective in a particular calendar year.  (NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK:  This woul=
d=20
generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determine=
d=20
and scheduled.  That is, it's unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost=
=20
study each time it entered into a contract with a QF.  Rather, one could=20
interpret Column (b) of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effec=
t=20
in calendar year 1995, 1996, etc.)  Further to this interpretation, Section=20
10(a) also lays out the manner in which total capacity charges are adjusted=20
"if for any calendar year, beginning with the second calendar year after the=
=20
calendar year during which the Commercial Operation Date occurs..." the=20
project fails to achieve a 60% "Contract Capacity Factor" (which is=20
determined based on results for any calendar year).  Based on Consumers'=20
action and this language, the partnership remained silent on the=20
interpretation leading to the rate increase.

As a result of restructuring legislation passed in June 2000, Consumers now=20
operates under a "fuel cap"; that is, its Power Service Cost Recovery (PSCR)=
=20
rate is frozen.  Accordingly, whereas costs incurred under the PPA were=20
previously a pass-through (i.e., via Consumers' PSCR and/or base rates),=20
Consumers now has a strong incentive to minimize purchased power costs as an=
y=20
savings will, in theory, flow directly to shareholders. =20

Issue

It should come as no surprise that Consumers' recently concluded that it has=
=20
implemented capacity rate increases erroneously.  While no action has been=20
taken to date, Consumers has indicated in the course of discussing the=20
reverse tolling transaction for MPLP that it does not intend to implement a=20
rate increase on January 1, 2001 but will defer the increase until October 1=
,=20
2001.  There was no suggestion that Consumers would attempt to reconcile pas=
t=20
capacity rate billing differences (i.e., "backbilling"), but we need to=20
assume that they will go after this value as well. =20

Three side notes on this issue:

To the extent rates were erroneously applied in the past, it would appear=20
that these costs to Consumers would have been recovered from ratepayers; Mik=
e=20
Mazowita has indicated that he's seen regulatory filings that would support=20
this point.  Accordingly, it would appear that Consumers would face some=20
regulatory issues to the extent it considered "backbilling"; it's not clear=20
yet how these would play out in light of the currently effective fuel cap.

We identified this issue during due diligence on MPLP and modeled capacity=20
charges on a going forward basis in a manner that reflects a contract year=20
interpretation that has capacity rates running from October 1 to September=20
30.  Accordingly, we have minimal exposure on value but for the issue of=20
backbilling, however...

We need to know what rates should be in effect January 1, 2001 in order to=20
structure a reverse tolling transaction.  It goes without saying, but this i=
s=20
an untimely issue in the context of reverse tolling discussions with=20
Consumers.=20

Legal Questions

Do we have a valid claim that Consumers is required to implement a capacity=20
rate increase on January 1, 2001?

Does Consumers have a claim to value lost (i.e., backbilling) as a result of=
=20
the manner in which rate increases have been previously applied?

To the extent that Consumers does have a claim on backbilling, do we have a=20
right to recovery from MCN as we were not the owner of the facility during=20
most of the period of time during which rates may have been applied=20
erroneously?

Do we have any claims against Dynegy as the MGP of the asset?  That is, did=20
they have a fiduciary responsibility to (1) pursue/resolve the issue when it=
=20
first came up or (2) reserve for future claims by Consumers based on a=20
different (an potentially correct) interpretation of the contract?

Let me know when you'll be prepared to discuss this and I'll pull together=20
the right group.
