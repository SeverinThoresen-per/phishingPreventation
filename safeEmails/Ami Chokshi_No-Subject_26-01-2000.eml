Deals 141877,141883, and 141884 (Koch Midstream) were in CES's system (and=20
ours) as term sales. However,  those deals were terminated by CES. So, any=20
volumes at KMID are sold to Midcon Texas P/L Operator at IF-.09. The purchas=
e=20
price is (.10) for base volumes and (.11) for swing volumes. For Feb, I=20
zeroed the volumes in deals 141877,141833,141884, in Sitara. All of the=20
volumes will be in deal 156256. O'Neal, do we need to risk assign this new=20
deal? Julie, it is an evergreen deal.  MTPL takes whatever is produced at th=
e=20
points. Let me know if I can help with anything else.

Thanks,
AC
