 =20
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the=20
year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long=20
way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she need=
s=20
to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the plac=
e=20
she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its=20
kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is=20
going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk=20
about this soon.
Love,
 Your Son =20
