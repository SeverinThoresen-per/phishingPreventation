Tonight Kris and I met with the SAP team about the critical issues we=20
discussed in the meeting this morning. =20

As far as Xref1 (coordinator) and Xref2 (physical vs. financial flag) fields=
=20
go, it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live=20
7/1.  Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would=20
automatically populate these 2 fields.  However, the test was unsuccessful. =
=20
These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them=20
manually when netting.  I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1,=20
but the first priority is having a place to put the data.

As far as settlement period is concerned, we are probably going to get a=20
hybrid of what we want at this time.  The SAP team does appear to have=20
appropriate resources working on this issue.  For data created in SAP, I am=20
more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement sid=
e=20
of the entry, and the SAP folks now seem to think they can link over to it t=
o=20
get the settlement data.  For data converted, we will not be able to get the=
=20
settlement period in the same manner.  The offsetting entry in conversion is=
=20
to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account.  The=20
dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date.  Another issue is related t=
o=20
the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or=20
