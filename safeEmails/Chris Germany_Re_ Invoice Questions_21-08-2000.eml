Subject: Invoice Questions


Chris--In addition to my question regarding the AGL-related "transportation
adjustment" charges in the June 15, 2000 invoice for May 2000 (invoice #
11738SA), can you also please check on the 200,000 dth sold to CES at the TE=
NN
Bear Creek storage facility in June?   (SA-236411).   Is this gas related to
one of the so-called pre-pay deals (TEAC, MGAM, MGAG)?  If not, what is it=20
for,
because we have not requested that any gas be injected into the Tennessee
storage for this injection season.

Thanks.
