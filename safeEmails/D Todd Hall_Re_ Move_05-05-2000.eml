Sally,

The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a=20
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was=20
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the=20
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirme=
d=20
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and =
I=20
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to boo=
k=20
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timel=
y=20
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives=20
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.

This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much=20
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides=
=20
I am ready to come home.

Have a good weekend,
Todd

FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  W=
e=20
have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may=
=20
want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then=20
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from=
=20
that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be ou=
t=20
of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally=20

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding=20
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th=20
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you giv=
e=20
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks
MRP

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I=20
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation.=20

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap=
=20
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up=20
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in=20
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat=
=20
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he=
=20
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more=20
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his=20
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend=20
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now=20
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S.=20
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize=20
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he=20
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out=20
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work=20
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 2=
2=20
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may=20
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and=
=20
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how=20
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no=
=20
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Tom,

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is i=
n=20
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I=20
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today=20
!!!!
