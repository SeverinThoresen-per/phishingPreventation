=09
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" alloca=
tion.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary f=
irm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needle=
s?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We a=
re looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  The=
n we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time. =20

	Thanks. Lynn
