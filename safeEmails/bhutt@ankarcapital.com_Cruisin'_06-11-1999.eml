Hey Mark

Good to see you again last Sunday and I hope the conference went well.

I dont want to be a pain, but I feel it only right and proper to flag an=20
issue I have.

My travel authorisation has not yet come through.  They are supposed to take=
=20
4 weeks, but it has been at least 8 so far.  The authorisation may come=20
through any time now, but if it does not come through I cannot leave the US.=
 =20
It would be stupid to jeopardise my Green Card application after waiting so=20
long.

Sorry about this, but if the worst comes to the worst I am sure you 3 guys=20
will have a great time anyhow.

Bruce
