WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc.=
 (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regu=
latory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.

Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulator=
y agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and Eur=
opean antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires s=
aid.=20


A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissi=
on, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Tr=
ade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into=
 the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co.=20


Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's own=
ership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agre=
ement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous att=
empt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications.=20


A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy mer=
ger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transactio=
n would entail, the attorneys said.=20


Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural ga=
s trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines.=20


Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas market=
ing.=20


The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merge=
r application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorne=
ys said.=20

       Racing Against The Liquidity Clock=20
  =20
"Enron is a complicated beast," and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would "s=
tretch FERC's limits of market-power review," one legal expert said.=20

The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the c=
ompanies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an=
 unacceptable level.=20


Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes =
electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for =
a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road.=20


According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive =
power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the co=
mbined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under a=
ntitrust review.=20


But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at bo=
th vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said.=20


On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron own=
s few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutini=
ze generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a =
contractual basis.=20


It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets =
truly complicated.=20


The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelin=
es - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - a=
nd Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive conc=
erns.=20


While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have =
some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could vi=
ew as problematic.=20


Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such s=
cale and scope before, legal experts agreed.=20


Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorne=
y, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25=
% of wholesale power sales are traded.=20


FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has i=
ndicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when consideri=
ng market power issues.=20


But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the=
 Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspe=
cts of the combination.=20


"These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading =
in commodities that have nothing to do with energy," noted one attorney. Ant=
itrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market=
 power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and=
 natural gas.=20


As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies we=
ren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange =
Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act.=20


The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business=
 holdings of multistate utility holding companies.=20


Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding=
 is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and poten=
tially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Por=
tland General Electric, attorneys agreed.=20


The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by Chevro=
nTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to =
avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to=
 a lawyer familiar with the deal.=20


Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidest=
ep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on =
the law.=20


Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contin=
gent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. "There are wa=
ys to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most peopl=
e think about."=20


Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liq=
uidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the =
way the companies have to go in the near term. "It's a run on the bank," the=
 holding company act expert said.=20


A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy m=
arkets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedi=
te the deal.=20


"Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing," the analyst s=
aid. "They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enro=
n."=20
