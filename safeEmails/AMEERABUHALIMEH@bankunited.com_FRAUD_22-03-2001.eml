Just to let you know. Fraud just called me about the case. they have receive=
d=20
the paperwork and they are ready to credit the full amount to the account=20
however instead I 'm going ot debit new account for $4504.30.

And tomorrow fraud will credit new account for the same amount.

This way we do not have to open the old account. In other words we trying to=
