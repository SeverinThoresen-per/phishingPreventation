Hi Stuart nice hearing from you. Life here has been tough from day 1, as I w=
as involved with the USS Cole! Would be nice to stay in touch. I'm leaving t=
he State Dept 15 Dec and returning to Navy active duty in Pensacola FL. I've=
 been in contact with your mom and it sounds as if she is having an impossib=
le time dealing with life and like you dad is in rough shape. Would love to =
have emails too for Ricky and Michael. We have a small family and would be a=
 shame to let it remain to be so scattered. Would love to hear what you are =
up to. Best regards, Jesse
