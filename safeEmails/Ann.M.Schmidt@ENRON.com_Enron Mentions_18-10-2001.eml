In an interview Tuesday, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said that about $35 mill=
ion of the $1.01 billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with=
 LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Mr. Fastow.=
 In a conference call yesterday with investors, Mr. Lay said that the 55 mil=
lion shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company "unwound" its part=
icipation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average n=
umber of shares outstanding was 913 million.=20
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares wer=

Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband=

Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the ques=

On Tuesday, after Enron reported its big quarterly loss, Moody's Investors S=

Enron Shareholder Sues Over Partnerships Run By CFO (Update2)

Enron Shareholder Sues Over Partnerships Run By CFO (Update2)

     (Adds detail on third-quarter loss in final paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s board cost the
company at least $35 million by allowing the chief financial
officer to manage partnerships that bought Enron assets, a
shareholder alleges in a lawsuit.

     Shareholder Fred Greenberg filed the suit today in Harris
County District Court in Houston, said Paul Paradis, a partner at
the law firm Abbey Gardy LLP and Greenberg's attorney. Enron is
based in Houston.

     Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's positions with two
limited partnerships that bought Enron assets was a clear conflict
of interest, Paradis said. The lawsuit doesn't specify which
assets the partnerships bought.

    ``Enron directors permitted Fastow to be in the unique
position of knowing what assets were worth,'' Paradis said. ``He
was placed in the position of irreconcilable conflict that
permitted him to capitalize on Enron's proprietary information.''

     The lawsuit comes the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported today that $35 million of the losses were
connected with two limited partnerships run by Fastow.

     The suit seeks damages of at least $35 million, Paradis said.
Damages would be paid to the company, probably by insurance
protecting directors from lawsuits, Paradis said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer declined to comment on the
allegations.

                       Formed to Lower Debt

     The company has formed several limited partnerships that buy
its assets. This allows Enron to reduce debt so it can borrow more
money for other projects.

      The suit, citing details from today's Wall Street Journal
article, says Fastow ran two of the partnerships, LJM Cayman and
LJM2. He could have earned as much as 2 percent annually of the
total amounts the partnerships invested, the suit says. LJM Cayman
raised $16 million in initial partnership capital, while LJM2
raised at least $200 million.

     Allowing a company official to run the partnerships raises
the question of impropriety, said Andre Meade, an analyst at
Commerzbank Securities who rates Enron a ``buy'' and owns no
company shares.

                     Partnerships Not Uncommon


     Many companies create limited partnerships, Meade said, using
them for tax purposes. ``Duke Energy Corp. and Kinder Morgan Inc.
both have limited partnerships where assets are transferred,'' he
said.

      Enron also has owned a controlling interest in Whitewing
Limited Partnership. Whitewing was financed with a $1.4 billion
bond sale last year conducted by Osprey Trust, which set up the
partnership with $807 million for buying Enron assets, according
to the Osprey Trust offering memorandum.

      Whitewing has bought 14 Enron power and gas companies since
it was formed in 1999, according to the memorandum. It had sold
four of them as of September 2000. Enron said in the offering
memorandum that officers and directors of the energy trader may
serve as directors of Whitewing.

     ``Therefore the duties of the directors and officers of Enron
may conflict with the duties of the officers and directors of
Whitewing Management LLC,'' the Osprey Trust offering memorandum
says.

     Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million, or 84
cents a share yesterday, compared with net income of $292 million,
or 34 cents, a year earlier. Shares of Enron fell $1.64 to $32.20
today.

Enron, the US energy trader which is under intense scrutiny by analysts who =
have demanded the company release more detailed financial information, on We=
dnesday gave details of a $1.2bn charge against equity it skipped over in it=
s third quarter results briefing on Tuesday.=20
On Wednesday, Enron outlined details of a $1.01bn charge against earnings in=
 its result, due to failed investments in its telecommunications, retail ene=
rgy sales and water businesses.
Ken Lay, chairman, fleetingly mentioned a separate $1.2bn charge against equ=
ity, or a dilution of equity on the company's balance sheet, in a conference=
 call with analysts and the media, and said it would not affect the company'=
s credit rating.=20
Many analysts apparently thought this was the $1.01bn charge Mr Lay was will=
ing to break down and to answer questions about.=20
Mr Lay met analysts on Wednesday in New York, but there was again no mention=
 of the $1.2bn charge. Mr Lay apparently initially refused to answer questio=
ns from frustrated analysts. In August, after the departure of Enron's chief=
 financial officer, Jeff Skilling, Mr Lay promised to provide more earnings =
transparency.=20
"It was unbelievable. Questions were asked and he moved around it and then f=

ated to the writing down of the se failed investments," one analyst said.=20
"They were trying to sneak it by. They already have a credibility problem an=
d this did not help it," he said, adding that Enron never disclosed the char=
ge's net effect and Moody's Inv estor's Services, the credit rating agency, =
placed Enron's $13bn of debt on hold minutes later. "We told them we felt th=
ey should have been more honest in the presentation [yesterday]."=20

Ford Motor Co. had a third-quarter loss of $692 million because the second-l=
argest auto maker cut production and offered zero-percent financing to draw =
car buyers into showrooms.=20
The loss of 38 cents a share, which compared with year-earlier net income of=
 $888 million, or 53 cents, includes the cost of Ford's plan to sell its com=
pany-owned dealerships. Sales declined 9% to $36.55 billion.
Chief Executive Jacques Nasser, who already is eliminating as many as 5,000 =
salaried jobs by year-end, said he will make more moves to reorganize in Dec=
ember. Ford cut North American production 23% from the year-earlier quarter =
as a slower economy hurt demand and tighter U.S. border security disrupted s=
upplies. Marketing expenses rose after Ford matched no-interest loans offere=
d by rival General Motors Corp.=20
The Dearborn, Mich.-based company's shares, which slipped 55 cents to close =
at $17.13 on the New York Stock Exchange, have fallen 27% this year.=20
Excluding one-time items, Ford had a loss from operations of $502 million, o=
r 28 cents a share, matching the average analyst forecast in a Thomson Finan=
cial/First Call survey.=20
The company's U.S. vehicle sales fell 11% through September, twice the indus=
trywide decline. Its revenue declined from $40.06 billion in the year-earlie=
r quarter. North American auto making operations had a third-quarter loss of=
 $849 million, compared with year-earlier profit of $782 million.=20
Ford's fourth-quarter results will improve from the third quarter but "it wi=
ll be difficult to earn a profit during the quarter," Chief Financial Office=
r Martin Inglis said on a conference call. The First Call average forecast t=
hat Ford will earn 6 cents a share is too high, he said.=20
At a Glance=20
Other earnings, excluding one-time gains or charges unless noted:=20
* Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, posted a $618-million loss in the =
third quarter after losing $1.01 billion on failed investments in water, tel=
ecommunications and retail energy sales.=20
The final loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends, th=
e Houston-based company said.=20
Net income in the year-earlier period was $292 million, or 34 cents. Revenue=
 rose 59% to $47.6 billion.=20
Excluding the charges, Enron said it would have earned $393 million, or 43 c=
ents a share, which matched the average estimate of analysts. Enron said it =
still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter.=20
* Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. said third-quarter operating pro=
fit was $230 million, or $1.13 a share, up 13% from $204 million, or $1.02 a=
 share, a year earlier.=20
Sales rose 22% to $3.02 billion.=20
But the company warned analysts not to boost their full-year earnings estima=
tes beyond $4.50 a share.=20
* Linens 'n Things Inc., the home-accessories and housewares retailer, said =
third-quarter profit fell 20%, and fourth-quarter earnings will be at the lo=
wer end of analysts' estimates. Net income fell to $14.7 million, or 36 cent=
s a share, from $18.4 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier. The company was =
expected to earn 37 cents. Sales 14% to $468.9 million.=20
* Office Depot Inc. said third-quarter profit rose 23% to $62.5 million, or =
20 cents a share, from $50.6 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Office De=
pot said fourth-quarter profit may be 3 cents to 5 cents a share below the 2=
0-cent average estimate of analysts.=20
* Drug giant Pfizer Inc. achieved double-digit earnings and revenue growth d=
uring the quarter, driven by strong sales of cholesterol treatment Lipitor.=20
Pfizer's operating profit jumped 28% to $2.19 billion, or 34 cents a share, =
a penny better than expected. Those figures exclude one-time costs, includin=
g those from Pfizer's acquisition of Warner Lambert.=20
Sales rose 10% to $7.90 billion.=20
* Philip Morris Cos., the biggest tobacco company, said third-quarter profit=
 rose slightly as sales of premium brands such as Marlboro increased in the =
U.S. while declining currencies hurt results abroad.=20
Net income rose to $2.33 billion, or $1.06 a share, from $2.32 billion, or $=
1.03, a year earlier. Sales climbed 12% to $22.4 billion. The company said i=
t will meet its previous full-year profit growth forecast of 9%.=20
Separately, the company said Chief Executive Geoffrey Bible plans to retire =
in 10 months at age 65. Under Bible, Philip Morris's five-year average annua=
l profit growth is 9.3%, helped by sales of the No. 1 Marlboro brand cigaret=
tes and the company's Miller Brewing and Kraft Foods Inc. businesses.=20
* Raytheon Co., maker of the Tomahawk missile used by U.S. forces in the att=
ack on Afghanistan, posted a net loss after charges, as weakness in its comm=
ercial aerospace operations offset gains from military businesses.=20
Raytheon reported a net loss of $285 million, or 79 cents per share, compare=

Those results include charges announced Wednesday from the company's Raytheo=

UK: ANALYSIS-LME members survey hard choices ahead.
By Martin Hayes

10/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) faces stormy time=
s a year after demutualisation as members ask where their future lies - with=
 electronic screens, on an open-outcry trading floor or even in some other t=
ype of business.=20
The debate is happening as the global metals industry gathers in London for =
the LME's annual dinner week, which this year will be a subdued affair.
"LME week will struggle to surprise against a backcloth of military action i=
n Afghanistan, dismal economic data, forlorn price sentiment and optimists r=
arer than hen's teeth," analyst Nick Moore of J.P. Morgan Securities said.=20
A veteran trader said, "It is going to be a less-populous affair this year. =
The people that have to do their annual deals will still be there, but we ha=
ve noticed that people are not travelling unless they have to."=20
The downturn in the economic cycle has hit the world's largest non-ferrous m=
etals market hard. Years of volume growth have ended, prices have fallen to =
lows and shrinking revenues and commissions have pared many brokers' profits=
=2E=20
MitsuiBussan has scaled back activities and no longer makes markets, ScotiaM=
ocatta has left the floor and blue-blooded N.M. Rothschild has simply quit t=
he non-ferrous metals business.=20
THE WAY TO TRADE=20
LME trading remains dominated by the price discovery mechanism of the open-o=
utcry official rings, but electronic systems have made deep inroads over the=
 past year.=20
"The trade is rapidly being condensed into the three screen mediums. Enron ,=
 Spectron and LME Select," a director at one broker said.=20
Traders said screens had almostly completely superseded the telephone market=
 during inter-office sessions as narrower buy/sell quotes in larger markets =
were available on the highly transparent screens.=20
"What that has done is to perfect the pricing mechanism - it has flattened o=
ut some of the volatility from the market. This has cut the brokers' margins=
, but at the same time their overheads are constant - they have to pay for s=
creens and to run a floor operation," the director said.=20
Screen trading volumes still represent only a small proportion of total dail=
y turnover, but earlier this week the LME reported a record daily turnover o=
f 10,483 lots on the Select system - by far the highest since the screens we=
re switched on in February.=20
"We are working hard to ensure that LME Select becomes the electronic tradin=
g system of choice for our members," LME Chief Executive Simon Heale said.=20
However, senior traders said that once volumes started to increase on screen=
s, electronic turnovers could explode - as had happened on other exchanges. =
That could force the issue for the LME as it continued to offer three method=
s of trading - screens, telephones and open-outcry.=20
"Despite the LME's resistance, the world is turning to screens. The IPE (Int=
ernational Petroleum Exchange) is going that way, and in the U.S. that patte=
rn is being seen as well," another senior trader said.=20
INCENTIVES=20
Traders said open-outcry trading would wither away unless the LME acted to m=
ake it more attractive to existing participants and potential new entrants.=20
"They should be thinking about giving discounts to people on the ring. Maybe=
 they should also approach some of the big off-market players and find out w=
hat would entice them to become RDMs (ring dealing members)," the veteran tr=
ader said.=20
In Europe, other than the LME only the IPE has an open-outcry floor, and tha=
t will close next year.=20
The RDMs of the LME are trying to fight back - in 2000 they extended the ope=
n-outcry sessions by carrying on business through an early-afternoon recess.=
=20
But after ScotiaMocatta Metals decided to call a halt to executing business =
on the floor this week RDM numbers have dwindled to just 11.=20
"It is a structural problem as there is just not enough income on the ring. =
We are almost getting to a 'last man standing' situation. If we drop under 1=
0 there is a danger the ring may just implode," the senior trader said.=20
The ranks of associate broker clearer members (ABCMs) are expanding. These f=
irms have all the benefits of LME membership, but cannot trade during the op=
en-outcry sessions.=20
This week, South Africa's Investec Group joined as an ABCM, bringing the tot=
al of this membership tier to 26. Another sizeable bank is pondering whether=
 to join, but only as an ABCM.=20
"It would be good if someone else came down, but who is going to spend money=
 recruiting a team - clerks, support staff, back office and so on? It is bes=
t to go for a small team using screens - the LME needs to either cut our cos=
ts or make it less easy to go off-market," a senior floor trader said.

Maharashtra to challenge London court order on DPC

THE MAHARASHTRA government has decided to challenge the injunction order iss=
ued by the commercial court in London restraining the state from filing suit=
s against the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in India. The DPC had obtained the =
injunction on October11.=20
The state government has decided to challenge the order as we feel that the =
concerned court should have heard the state as well. Within a week we would =
be presenting our case, the state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said here=
 on Wednesday.
The ex-parte order relates to arbitration proceedings between the state gove=
rnment and DPC with respect to state guarantee, state support and supplement=
al state support agreements.=20
It prevented the state government from taking any legal action in India, cha=
llenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. Mr Desh=
mukh today also reiterated his governments resolve not to draw electricity f=
rom DPC.=20
There is no logic in buying DPC power at higher rate and selling it with muc=
h lower rates, Deshmukh said. According to Deshmukh, due to recent rainfall,=
 the demand for electricity has gone down considerably and the state electri=
city board is supplying power without interruption.=20
Meanwhile, the government today expressed its resolve to initiate a judicial=
 probe into the entire Enron deal. The probe would begin in few weeks , Desh=
mukh said. The state has already requested the Chief Justice of the Mumbai H=
igh Court to appoint a judge for the probe.

NEW DELHI, Oct. 17 GAS Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) has written to both the=
 Petroleum Ministry and the Power Ministry evincing interest in the 5 millio=
n tonnes per annum (mmtpa) LNG regassification terminal of the Dabhol Power =
Company, according to Government officials.=20
In a recent communique to the two Ministries, it has asked the financial ins=
titutions to set up a meeting to enable it review the financial details of t=
he LNG project. The financial data on the LNG project solely rests with Bech=
tel, GE and Enron.
As a first step towards examining the financial data, GAIL will require to e=
nter into a confidentiality clause agreement with the present project sponso=
rs to access the data.=20
Meanwhile, the financial institutions are awaiting the results of political =
parleys between the Centre and the Maharashtra Government towards bringing t=
he latter into a 'solution finding' mode to implement a financial restructur=
ing package and resolve the Dabhol crisis.=20
Once this is done, the FIs will freeze the financial package - involving sac=
rifices undertaken by the present stakeholders - and again elicit market res=
ponse towards bettering the Tatas' proposition.=20
Although the FIs had earlier scouted the market and found only the Tatas evi=
ncing interest in the project, it would again offer the Dabhol project to th=
e market to ensure that the concessions on the part of the State are not awa=
rded on a nomination basis.=20
The foreign lenders have pointed out that they would not be agreeable to the=
 domestic FIs spearheading the salvage operation finally resulting in transf=
er of ownership of the power plant. Hence, the Government is mulling a high-=
level committee to implement the process leading to transfer of ownership.=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Federal energy regulators said this week they will=
 discuss possible changes to price controls the agency imposed on western wh=
olesale power markets in June.
Western utilities complained that the price controls, based on the price of =
generating power in California, aren't appropriate for the entire region. In=
 particular, demand in the Northwest rises sharply in the winter, while Cali=
fornia's power demand and cost are typically highest in the summer.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in a notice its Oct. 29 meetin=
g discussions could include an elimination of the 10% premium allowed for sa=
les into California and changes to the way the price caps are adjusted.=20
The price cap is set at about $92 a megawatt-hour and is calculated by takin=
g the 85% of the most expensive hourly price during the most-recent Stage 1 =
power emergency in California, when operating reserves fall below 7%.=20
Gov. Gray Davis lobbied hard for FERC to impose price caps throughout the en=
tire western U.S., saying generators would sell their power to other western=
 states if California were the only state with price controls.=20
"The governor would be very disappointed if FERC contributed to additional e=
conomic uncertainty, particularly in these troubling times" if the agency we=
re to lift the price restrictions, said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davi=
s.=20
Last summer, Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) unit Nevada Power was forced to =
initiate rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for about 45 minut=
es because of the new price caps imposed on the market by FERC and blisterin=
g heat, said Paul Heagen, Sierra Pacific's chief spokesman.=20
In addition, some generators, including a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE), scrappe=
d plans to build small power plants, the so-called peaking units used when d=
emand for electricity is at its highest, in the western U.S. because of the =
price controls.=20
