Elizabeth and I are coordinating on this matter. We commissioned the outside=

counsel advice together. Now that I'm back I'll get with her and see if we=20
can reach some conclusions on these issues. Please feel free to call me if=20
you wish to discuss further.

Elizabeth: I received a call from Leslie Hansen on this yesterday. I'll call=

her this week to discuss.

Alan,

I am currently compiling a list of those utilities that to our knowledge hav=
e=20
agents. I am also trying to round up all of the agency agreements from our=20
files. In light of outside counsel's comments regarding the ability of an=20
agent to bind more than one principal, I am quite concerned over the amount=20
of business we do this way.  I would be interested in reading whatever you=20
received from outside counsel.  Also, are you coordinating this with=20
Elizabeth Sager?  Tracy Ngo , who works in our group, told me Elizabeth has=20
outside counsel looking at this too ( she is working here part time?) and=20
they are fairly comfortable with how these documents work for power. In=20
addition, where do the FERC and SEC fit into the picture?  Tracy mentioned=20
something about required approvals.  I am trying to determine our exposure t=
o=20
these contracts, and whether they truly place our credit risk with the=20
utilities.

Thanks,
Tanya
