Stephanie,

In conjunction with the recent movement of several power traders, they are c=
hanging the names of their gas books as well.  The names of the new gas book=
s and traders are as follows:

PWR-NG-LT-SPP:  Mike Carson
PWR-NG-LT-SERC:  Jeff King

If you need to know their power desk to map their ID to their gas books, tho=
se desks are as follows:

EPMI-LT-SPP:  Mike Carson
EPMI-LT-SERC:  Jeff King

I will be in training this afternoon, but will be back when class is over.  =
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help!
Casey
