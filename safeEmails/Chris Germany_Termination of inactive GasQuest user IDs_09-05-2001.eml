I've expired access to the four persons you requested be terminated.  Additi=
onally, I need to update our Security Administrator records by replacing Dan=
 Junek with someone else.... perhaps yourself.  At any rate, I need a name, =
business address, phone and fax number for the designated Security Administr=
ator.  If questions, please advise.  Thanks, Chris.                  /Bob
