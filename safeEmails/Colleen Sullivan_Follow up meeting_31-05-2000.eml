I will let you know a final time for our follow up meeting regarding positio=
n=20
reporting on transportation capacity.  As you recall, I wanted each of you t=
o=20
pick one pipeline (a difficult one) and let me know how you would go about=20
assessing an initial position for that capacity, and how you know on a daily=
=20
basis what has been used and what is remaining.  Hopefully this will assist=20
us in translating that information into a formal position reporting system.

If you are not planning to be here on any days next week, please let me know=
=20
that so that I can plan the meeting accordingly.  As always, I will set the=20
meeting up sometime between 11:00 am and 1:00 p.m.

Thank you.
