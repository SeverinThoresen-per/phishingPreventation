No sector of the Indian economy represents the failure of economic reforms a=

electricity boards (SEBs) on the basis of what was seen as a robust model=20
separation of generation, transmission and distribution activities was=20
attempted by some states. A Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and=20
several state-level regulatory bodies were set up. Foreign investors were=20
invited into generation and distribution activities. So, it cannot be said=20
that no changes were attempted, or that they were not in line with the=20
overall objective of promoting private investment in the context of the=20
complementary roles of competition and regulation. But, when we look at the=20
state of the sector today, the only reasonable assessment of it is that it i=
s=20
deep in crisis.=20
The SEBs collectively owe the central power companies a reported Rs 28,000=20
crore. A government committee recently recommended that half the dues be=20
written off, while the other half settled by way of an issue of=20
interest-bearing bonds by the SEBs to the power companies. The moral hazard=20
the incentive to default on future obligations inherent in this=20
recommendation is obvious, and could not have escaped the committee's=20
considerations. That they could only arrive at this solution speaks=20
eloquently about the complete bankruptcy in this sector. Its financial state=
=20
just does not allow anybody to take even the slightest risk inherent in a=20
solution that would have some chance of long-term success.
Two foreign investors Enron, a generator in Maharashtra and AES, a=20

s=20
about finances. Maharashtra cannot afford to pay Enron for the power it was=20

buy power from Enron are getting nowhere, because, of the four states that=20

Predictions that California would suffer 260 hours of blackouts this summer=20

That sudden shift, from crisis to calm, obscures an equally dramatic change=20
in California's long-term approach to how electricity gets bought and sold.=20
Just three years ago, the state had embarked on a broad deregulation scheme=20

h=20
a tripling of electricity rates or opening the state's checkbook, a=20
grim-faced Gov. Gray Davis signed an emergency decree to allow the Departmen=
t=20
of Water Resources to use its budget to buy electricity that would then be=20
sold to consumers.=20
That act, later broadened and formalized by the Legislature, opened the door=
=20
for taxpayer money--$8 billion and counting--to be used to buy electricity.=20
"It's our obligation to provide power to the homes and businesses that drive=
=20
California," Davis said at the time. "I'm disappointed the utilities can't d=
o=20
it. We have no choice but to step in, and we will do it."=20
The involvement of the state in buying power changed the political=20
calculations involved in setting electricity rates. For months, the private=20
utilities had complained that California's rates, which were frozen as part=20
of the state's deregulation law, were lower than the cost of buying power.=20
But raising rates to help the utilities was politically unpalatable; the=20
Public Utilities Commission in January gave them just a fraction of what the=
y=20
sought by raising rates for PG&E and Edison residential customers by 9%.=20
After the state began buying power, though, it was California's treasury tha=
t=20
was at risk. Pressure built quickly for more rate hikes. In March, the PUC=20
approved the largest increase in its history, boosting the rates of some=20
customers by more than 40%.=20
Those increases showed up in bills last month. The higher costs and=20
conservation efforts have reduced demand. Cooler-than-expected weather=20
lowered demand even more. Californians used 12% less electricity last month=20
than in June 2000, after adjusting for weather and economic growth, accordin=
g=20
to the California Energy Commission.=20
Seven months after the state began buying power, January's sense of urgency=20
has dissipated. Buyer's remorse is setting in. Grumbling grows louder about=20
how deeply the state has inserted itself into the electricity business.=20
It was a "huge mistake" to let the Department of Water Resources become the=20
buyer of most of the electricity used by California, said Bill Booth, an=20
attorney for the California Large Energy Consumers Assn., a group of heavy=20
industry manufacturers that pushed hard for deregulation in the early 1990s.=
=20
"I would hope that the state as an entity chooses to get out of that role=20
sooner rather than later," Booth said. "The state has shown zero capability=20
of doing that well," he said, voicing a criticism also made by Republican=20
lawmakers.=20
Davis and his advisors argue that they had little choice but to jump in and=20
buy power on behalf of the utilities. And they insist that their interventio=
n=20
has stabilized the market.=20
Long-Term Contracts Called 'Insurance'=20
After the state government began buying electricity, officials moved quickly=
=20
to get the state out of the exorbitant spot market by locking up $43-billion=
=20
worth of long-term power contracts, some lasting more than a decade.=20
Lawmakers and consumer advocates are growing increasingly critical of those=20
contracts, some of which are now more expensive than the falling prices in=20
the spot market.=20
But Davis administration officials insist that spot market prices are fallin=
g=20
only because the state is now buying 40% of its power under contract, rather=
=20
than bidding up prices by seeking all of its electricity in the market.=20
"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit, but it's a damned good=20
thing to have," said S. David Freeman, the governor's top energy advisor and=
=20
the former general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.=
=20
"The people in this ballgame that will criticize long-term contracts will=20
criticize anything with stability in it because God forbid that it may turn=20
out to cost a tiny bit more than what the spot market is in the future,"=20
Freeman added. "That kind of thinking leads you to be in the spot market."=20
The shift out of the spot market is not the only factor that has stabilized=20
the situation, however, and some accuse the governor of taking undue credit.=
=20
The change is "clearly explained by the fundamentals of supply, which has=20
increased, and demand, which has decreased because people are conserving,"=20
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a=
=20
group of electricity sellers.=20
The price of natural gas, the fuel used to run most of California's power=20
plants, has fallen by half since early January. There is widespread=20
disagreement about why--mirroring the argument over why gas prices spiked in=
=20
the first place.=20
When prices rose, electricity companies accused gas pipeline companies of=20
gouging. The gas firms said power generators bid up the price knowing they=20
could recoup the cost by selling expensive megawatts.=20
Another factor in lowering wholesale electricity prices is that the state's=20
overall power supplies are more abundant because many power plants that were=
=20
shut down this spring are running again.=20
At times last winter, more than 10,000 megawatts of capacity were offline.=20
Recent plant shutdowns have totaled closer to 4,000 megawatts. Three new=20
power plants have opened this summer, adding 1,415 megawatts to the state's=20
capacity.=20
Statewide demand for electricity has been peaking at a little more than=20
30,000 megawatts in recent days.=20
Again, the reasons for the additional supply are disputed. Generating=20
companies say their plants were shut down earlier this year for repairs and=20
maintenance.=20
State officials and consumer advocates have alleged that some of the plants=20
were taken offline to manipulate prices. Today, with less power being bought=
=20
on the spot market, there are fewer incentives for such manipulation.=20
A federal wholesale electricity price cap that took effect in June also has=20
also dampened prices, experts say.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed the cap, now at $92 per=20
megawatt-hour, after resisting the pleas of California politicians for nearl=
y=20
a year.=20
"They just did a complete 180," said Severin Borenstein, director of the=20
University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, "and if they had done=
=20
it earlier, we would have saved a lot of money."=20
The agency that manages most of the state's transmission grid has found that=
=20
bids by power sellers dropped after June 21, when the price limit took=20
effect. But assessing how much of the change resulted from the cap and how=20
much from other factors "is difficult," said Anjali Sheffrin, director of=20
market analysis at the California Independent System Operator.=20
The changes in the market--and the debate between the administration and its=
=20
critics--involve who pays for risk.=20
Little Incentive for Firms to Trim Costs=20
Before deregulation in 1998, California's electricity industry was designed=20
above all to avoid the risk of shortages. Utilities built a cushion of=20
supply, and regulators guaranteed that they could pass on the cost to their=20
customers.=20
Critics said that such regulation left the utilities with little incentive t=
o=20
trim costs, meaning that ratepayers paid higher bills.=20
Deregulation was supposed to shift the risk of owning power generation to=20
private companies and those who bought their stock. Proponents said consumer=
s=20
would benefit as private firms risked their own money to build power plants=20
and competed with one another to sell electricity.=20
But in practice, competition in California brought price spikes and supply=20
shortages.=20
"The reason why economists have preached that competition is better than=20
regulation," said Ken Rose, executive director of the National Regulatory=20
Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus, "is that the=20
investor putting his own dollars on the line will be more careful with those=
=20
dollars. The downside of that is if there's any ability of the suppliers to=20
control prices, then they'll exploit that advantage, which is what you'd=20
expect them to do.=20
"You can't make risk go away," he said.=20
Now Californians face a different risk: that a new, largely untested=20
96-person, $2-million-per-month bureaucracy designed to buy power could run=20
amok.=20
There's no easy way to disband the power-buying operation until the utilitie=
s=20
get back on their feet financially. That could take years. In April, PG&E=20
filed for bankruptcy to fend off creditors. Edison's finances have started t=
o=20
improve somewhat, but the company is still seeking help from the Legislature=
,=20
where no rescue plan seems to be gaining momentum.=20
In the meantime, the Department of Water Resources has little oversight as i=
t=20
goes about its newly assigned job of buying electricity.=20
The Public Utilities Commission for 80 years has dictated the rates utilitie=
s=20
could charge. But under new rules proposed earlier this month, the PUC will=20
essentially become a rubber stamp, adjusting rates for customers of PG&E,=20
Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to match whatever amount of money th=
e=20
Department of Water Resources says is needed.=20
Even PUC officials say such a drastic loss of control is necessary to allow=20
the state to sell $13.4 billion in bonds. Those bonds are designed to repay=20
the state's taxpayers for past power costs. They will be backed by the money=
=20
that customers pay PG&E, Edison and SDG&E each month.=20
That is just one of the ways in which the drastic actions taken to prevent a=
n=20
energy meltdown have hemmed in policymakers trying to envision the future=20
shape of the state's electricity industry.=20
"There is certainly a lot less room for designing the future than many peopl=
e=20
would like," said state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey).=20
For example, competition--the dream of deregulators--appears dead for at=20
least several years.=20
That's because of the need to pay for the long-term contracts and reimburse=20
the state's general fund for the billions already spent.=20
The owners of steel mills, cement plants and grocery stores blanch at the=20
cost of the contracts. They are chafing to break from the utilities and cut=20
their own deals for electricity with private companies such as Enron Corp.=20
Such one-on-one deals were banned by the Legislature when it put the state=20
into the power-buying business.=20
"Ultimately, we think our own companies buying power for themselves is the=20
best solution," said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers=
=20
and Technology Assn.=20
But that move would again shift the risks inherent in the electricity=20
business. Allowing big firms to walk away from the utilities would mean that=
=20
someone else--renters, homeowners and small business owners--would have to=20
bear the cost of maintaining a cushion of extra supply for the state. Many=20
lawmakers are reluctant to allow that.=20
"Any kind of meaningful competition in California has been postponed until=20
2004, 2005, at which time some of the long-term contracts start ending," sai=
d=20
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network=20
in San Diego.=20
Ultimately, Davis said in an interview, "the long-term solution to this=20
problem depends on having more power than we need."=20
Generators base their prices "on how much power they know you do or do not=20
have," Davis said. To protect consumers from being gouged, he said, the=20
state's goal should be to always have at least 15% more power than it needs.=
=20
Private companies will never take on the risk of building the last few power=
=20
plants necessary to ensure a surplus, said Davis, so the state must.=20
To that end, Davis backed a law that takes effect next month creating a=20
Public Power Authority. The agency will be able to sell $5 billion in revenu=
e=20
bonds to build, buy and own power plants and to finance energy efficiency an=
d=20
conservation programs.=20
Ironically, the governor said, this new agency, as the "builder of last=20
resort," could clear the way for the competition that the state's=20
deregulation plan so miserably failed to achieve.=20
"We've never really had a chance to test deregulation in an ideal world,=20
because we've never had more power than we need," the governor said. "My=20
overriding goal is to keep the lights on and provide Californians with the=20
power they need. . . . A byproduct of our efforts will be to put the state i=
n=20
a position where deregulation works."=20
In the hybrid system Davis envisages, the state government will act like a=20
giant public power agency and control nearly as much electricity as private=20
companies. That role for California government would have been inconceivable=
=20
just two years ago, said Ohio State University's Rose, who tracks the way=20

SAN FRANCISCO -- When a big bankruptcy case comes along, so does the=20
bankruptcy gang.=20
After PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for protection from=20
creditors in April, major law firms and other high-priced professionals=20
queued up and began billing.
PG&E's lead counsel already has charged $2.65 million in the first two month=
s=20
of a case that some experts say could stretch into years. A financial adviso=
r=20
asked for as much as $350,000 a month and once considered seeking a "success=
=20
fee" of $20 million if the company's reorganization panned out. A financial=20
consultant of the PG&E creditors committee has proposed a $1.5-million fee=20
for six months' work.=20
The PG&E case offers an extraordinary view of an arcane field usually outsid=
e=20
the limelight.=20
Total court-approved fees in the bankruptcy filing--the third-largest in U.S=
=2E=20
history--could amount to at least $470 million, said UCLA law professor Lynn=
=20
LoPucki, a leading expert on bankruptcy practice.=20
"The bigger the case, the bigger the fees," he said. But even that figure,=20
LoPucki said, could go higher because of the regulatory and public policy=20
issues involved in the case, which he described as "one of the most complex=20
cases ever."=20
Along with those huge fees come complex potential conflicts. Ethical problem=
s=20
have long haunted the bankruptcy field, despite repeated efforts at reforms=20
that have followed scandals involving prominent firms. Though the PG&E=20
bankruptcy case is in its earliest stages, entanglements that experts say=20
could present ethical issues already have arisen as several prominent firms=20
were approved by the bankruptcy judge:=20
* PG&E's main law firm also represents banking interests that are tied to on=
e=20
of the utility's biggest debts, a nearly $1-billion credit arrangement.=20
* PG&E's accounting firm has done unrelated work for more than 80 companies=20
involved in the PG&E bankruptcy case, including some of the utility's=20
creditors.=20
* The law firm for the official committee of PG&E creditors represents a=20
$400-million Arizona power project being developed by an arm of PG&E's paren=
t=20
company.=20
* The accounting firm for the committee does work for PG&E and its parent=20
company, a corporate relationship being examined by the state's utility=20
regulator.=20
For shareholders or creditors of a company in bankruptcy proceedings,=20
conflicts can create serious problems. The complex legal and accounting=20
issues that arise in a bankruptcy case provide numerous opportunities for=20
professional firms to alter outcomes in ways that benefit a favored company=20
and harm the client relying on their advice.=20
Experts say the sheer size of today's professional firms and the vast reach=20
of PG&E, whose business activities touch virtually every sector of=20
California, make conflicts almost inevitable.=20
"Very few people have the expertise for high-profile, high-stakes=20
bankruptcies, so you have a small pool from which to draw representation, an=
d=20
that's where . . . potential conflicts come up," said Nancy B. Rapoport, a=20
University of Houston law professor and a leading bankruptcy ethics expert.=20
"Today," LoPucki said, "it's not a question of whether there's a conflict,=20
it's how big it is."=20
Dozens of Firms Vying for Contracts=20
The bankruptcy case of PG&E, with a reported $31.5 billion in assets, is big=
,=20
indeed. Only two cases from the late 1980s, Texaco Inc. and Financial Corp.=20
of America, surpass it when measured by the dollar value of the assets at=20
stake.=20
Records show that about a dozen firms are in line for lucrative contracts=20
with either PG&E or the official committee representing thousands of the=20
utility's unsecured creditors. So are dozens of other firms that have=20
continuing legal work for the company.=20
All will be paid from the PG&E bankruptcy estate, if Judge Dennis Montali=20
approves their employment.=20
To become eligible for legal, accounting and consulting work, each firm must=
=20
convince the judge that it is qualified to do the job and does not have=20
unmanageable conflicts of interest.=20
Many firms in the PG&E case have worked with one another or represent partie=
s=20
with a financial interest in the outcome, such as lenders and creditors, in=20
matters outside the case.=20
With the limited number of bankruptcy specialists, "naturally you have=20
lawyers and others working both sides of the fence," said Mary Josephine=20
Newborn Wiggins, professor at the University of San Diego School of Law.=20
"There are bound to be some situations where it gets sticky."=20
Time and again, firms acknowledged in disclaimers filed with Bankruptcy Cour=
t=20
that they have so many ties to other companies that they may not have=20
unearthed all connections and potential conflicts. Some addressed potential=20
conflicts by erecting "ethical walls" within their own firms or having=20
clients sign waivers that absolve the professionals of conflicts of interest=
=2E=20
Experts say ethical walls amount to honor systems with no outside monitoring=
=20
and that waivers sometimes are granted without the client's full=20
understanding of the potential conflicts.=20
They also point out that not all connections between adversarial interests=20
constitute conflicts, and not all conflicts are serious enough to disqualify=
=20
a firm from a case.=20
The fact that so many issues arise in cases of this magnitude has meant that=
=20
the bankruptcy system is forced to make accommodations for big firms with=20
overlapping clients.=20
"By traditional conflict standards, the large firms could not participate in=
=20
the cases," LoPucki said. "There has been a huge shift in what is acceptable=
=2E=20
It is more lenient. A firm is allowed to represent [clients] today where the=
y=20
would not have been allowed 20 years ago."=20
'Ethical Walls' Used to Avoid Conflicts=20
The complexity of the entanglements--and the manner in which the system has=20
adapted to them--can be seen in the roles played in the PG&E case by two of=20
the nation's largest accounting firms, Deloitte & Touche and=20
PricewaterhouseCoopers, and one of its most prominent law firms, Milbank,=20
Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.=20
When PG&E proposed hiring Deloitte & Touche for a base fee of $855,000 and a=
n=20
hourly rate of $450 to $650 for partners, the U.S. trustee in the case, Lind=
a=20
Ekstrom Stanley, objected.=20
The U.S. trustees office is an arm of the Department of Justice that Congres=
s=20
created in 1978 to help combat what critics derisively dubbed bankruptcy=20
rings. The trustees administer bankruptcy cases and are instructed to guard=20
against abuses and profiteering by professionals.=20
So far in the PG&E case, Stanley's office has weighed in against the=20
appointments of several major companies, voicing objections ranging from=20
excessive fees to conflicts. Her office succeeded in preventing the creditor=
s=20
committee from hiring a public relations firm, and it won a tentative ruling=
=20
that would prevent PG&E from indemnifying a financial consulting firm agains=
t=20
negligence claims arising from its work.=20
The investment banking firm, Dresdener, Kleinwort & Wasserstein, has stopped=
=20
working for PG&E because of the lack of indemnification. PG&E is hunting for=
=20
a new financial consultant.=20
In the case of Deloitte & Touche, Stanley's office seized on the company's=20
disclosure that it had worked not only for PG&E but also for its parent=20
company and for another subsidiary, PG&E National Energy Group. The=20
accounting firm had performed $14.4 million in work last year for the three=20
PG&E entities.=20
The trustee said that work posed a potential conflict because the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission was reviewing PG&E's controversial transfers of=20
funds to its parent company.=20
Deloitte & Touche argued successfully that its relationships with three PG&E=
=20
entities did not compromise the company's ability to fairly represent PG&E i=
n=20
the bankruptcy.=20
In the interest of full disclosure, Deloitte & Touche reported it formerly=20
employed a daughter of Judge Montali. The firm also said it employs the wife=
=20
of another bankruptcy judge in San Francisco. She logged fewer than 50 hours=
=20
of tax consulting work last year for PG&E's parent, the firm said.=20
Ethics experts said such personal connections generally would not be enough=20
to prompt a judge to disqualify a firm. "It's obviously an interesting=20
relationship," Rapoport said. "It comes down to . . . how much of an=20
appearance of too much closeness he wants to put up with."=20
Issues involving the second accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, arose=20
when the committee representing PG&E's creditors proposed hiring the firm as=
=20
its accountant and financial advisor. Stanley's office objected that the=20
firm, like Deloitte & Touche, works for PG&E and its parent.=20
"Professionals . . . must have no conflict of interest . . . and owe=20
undivided loyalty to the creditors committee," the trustees office said.=20
"It is not beyond imagining that [PG&E and its parent] could influence=20
[PricewaterhouseCoopers] through these continuing relationships, the promise=
=20
of future engagements and other intangibles," the trustee said in one filing=
=2E=20
PricewaterhouseCoopers said it would build an ethical wall within the firm t=
o=20
avoid problems or other dicey situations in which PG&E, its parent or=20
affiliates are adversaries. The judge approved the hiring.=20
Rapoport said such ethical walls do not necessarily prevent improper=20
communications within firms. "I don't think you can rely on an honor system=20
or an internalized moral compass. That is why we have rules in the first=20
place," she said.=20
As its legal counsel, the PG&E creditors committee received permission to=20
hire Milbank. The law firm disclosed that it represented some of PG&E's=20
creditors in matters unrelated to the bankruptcy. The firm also represents a=
=20
$400-million Arizona power plant project being developed by a subsidiary of=20
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group.=20
Some bankruptcy experts said there was a potential for conflict, but the fir=
m=20
said the connection was tangential.=20
In addition, the firm worked for the California Power Exchange, the=20
now-bankrupt entity that under California's deregulation plan served as the=20
state's energy marketplace. Milbank resigned that post several weeks before=20
the Power Exchange filed its own bankruptcy petition in March. The=20
resignation, Milbank said, was "due to certain potential conflicts with=20
creditors" of the exchange.=20
One of Milbank's clients is Enron Corp., which, using other counsel, sued th=
e=20
Power Exchange, trying to get back collateral held by the exchange to ensure=
=20
power deliveries.=20
Enron now sits on the PG&E creditors committee represented by Milbank.=20
Another of PG&E's creditors is the Power Exchange, which is seeking nearly $=
2=20
billion for energy companies that sold electricity to the utility but were=20
not paid. Records show Milbank has filed a claim of about $373,000 against=20
the exchange for legal work.=20
George Sladoje, president and chief executive of the Power Exchange, said he=
=20
was shocked when Milbank, its longtime counsel, quit. "It was very difficult=
=20
to find [new] counsel," he said. "There were conflicts all over the place"=20
among law firms because so many did legal work for PG&E and Southern=20
California Edison.=20
Ed Feo, managing partner of Milbank's Los Angeles office, said the company=20
did its best to avoid conflicts in both bankruptcy cases--by dropping=20
representation of a client in one and fully disclosing its connections in th=
e=20
other.=20
As for Milbank's role in the PG&E case, Rapoport said that representing=20
creditors and a creditors committee is "OK as long as their interests do not=
=20
diverge."=20
However, she said, "Bankruptcy is like the Chinese game of Go. Moves have=20
ramifications 20 steps later."=20
Disclosure Often Is Safest Legal Course=20
As a practical matter, the safest course legally in a bankruptcy case is to=20
try to disclose every connection and let the judge decide whether to allow a=
=20
firm to participate.=20
"Disclosure cures a multitude of ills," said Lawrence Gottesman, chairman of=
=20
the bankruptcy practice at Brown, Raysman, Millstein, Felder & Steiner in Ne=
w=20
York City. By contrast, he said, "the penalty for working with an undisclose=
d=20
conflict can be severe."=20
Milbank learned that three years ago, when John G. Gellene, once a lawyer=20
with the firm, was sentenced to 15 months in prison and fined $15,000 for=20
failing to disclose during a bankruptcy case that he also was working for a=20
creditor in separate litigation. Before the sentencing, the firm had returne=
d=20
$1.9 million in legal fees and fired Gellene.=20
To ferret out potential conflicts, firms rely heavily on the computer. Those=
=20
involved in the PG&E case, for example, usually checked their computerized=20
client lists against the biggest 100 PG&E creditors and other players, such=20
as other professional firms, the trustee's staff and the judge.=20
Even then, there are limits. The computerized checks did not touch tens of=20
thousands of smaller PG&E creditors. And the firms themselves commonly issue=
=20
disclaimers, saying they might not have turned up all their potential=20
conflicts.=20
If a law firm finds it has a troubling conflict, it also can seek a conflict=
=20
waiver from its existing client, which essentially gives the firm permission=
=20
to pursue dual representation.=20
PG&E's lead counsel, Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin,=20
reported receiving $1.9 million from the company in the year before the=20

Enron Lenders Petition Indian Court to Support Company, FT Says
2001-07-29 23:32 (New York)


     Mumbai, July 30 (Bloomberg) -- Foreign lenders to Enron
Corp.'s Indian power project have petitioned the country's
highest court for the right to support the world's top energy
trader in its payment dispute with the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board, the Financial Times reported, without citing
its sources.
     Enron's $3 billion project, Dabhol Power Co., and the
electricity board, its sole customer, have for seven months
been in dispute over $64 million in unpaid bills.
     The electricity board has said it will use a local
arbitrator to mediate the dispute. The foreign lenders say this
violates a provision for arbitration in a neutral location that
was a factor in their decision to invest in the project, the
paper said.
     Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank, ABN Amro
Holding NV, Overseas Private Investment Corp. of the U.S. and
other financial institutions have loaned $440 million to
Enron's project, the paper said.
     The state electricity board stopped buying Dabhol's power
in May, saying it's too expensive. The move came days after
Dabhol said it was beginning a six-month notice period to end
its contract with Maharashtra. Dabhol halted production after
the board stopped buying its power.
     Enron wants India to buy out its 65 percent stake in the
project, in which it has invested $875 million.


California Fires Five Consultants Over Conflicts, Paper Says
2001-07-29 17:42 (New York)


     Los Angeles, July 29 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis's administration fired five energy consultants because of
conflicts of interest between their official duties and personal
finances, the Los Angeles Times reported.
     Four of the consultants owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San
Jose, California-based electricity generator, the Times said. One
of them, William Mead, told the paper that state officials didn't
tell him that he couldn't own energy-company stocks.
     The highest-ranking consultant fired, Richard Ferreira,
disclosed that he owned as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, the
paper said. Ferreira, who couldn't be reached for comment, had
participated in a review of one of Calpine's power-supply
contracts with the state, the paper said.
     California law prohibits officials from taking part in
decisions that affect their financial interests. The state, which
began buying electricity on behalf of its biggest utilities in
January after prices soared, has awarded Calpine about $13 billion
in supply contracts, the Times said.
     Two other consultants reported owning stock in Enron Corp.,
the biggest electricity trader, the paper said. Another two bought
stock in Edison International, owner of Southern California
Edison, the state's No. 2 utility.
     Davis officials disclosed the firings on Friday, the Times
said. They also are investigating a sixth consultant, Elaine
Griffin, who bought Calpine stock just before starting her state
job and left three days after reporting the investment, the Times
said. She couldn't be reached for comment, the paper said.
