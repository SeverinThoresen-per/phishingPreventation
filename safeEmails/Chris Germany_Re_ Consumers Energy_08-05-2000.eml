The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from=20
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of=20
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title=20
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user=20
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool=20
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer=20
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU =20
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.
