I believe so.  Basically, the true-up flag will need to be set from previous=
 day through current day and the current day (e.g. 1/31 for the 1/31 vs. 1/3=
0 calc) will need to be true-up.  Currently, even if we set the true-up para=
meters to true-up through the current day, port calc still will not true it =
up.  However, with the high volume of financial transactions the traders wil=
l be doing, we will have to find a way to true up the last day before we clo=
se the books for the month. =20

Norman, looks like your next task has just arrived!!!  Let me know if you ha=

e current day of calc when necessary.

Thanks.

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the big=
gest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Beca=
use we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of =
financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing =
with fairly large PMA adjustments.=20

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these number=
s.
