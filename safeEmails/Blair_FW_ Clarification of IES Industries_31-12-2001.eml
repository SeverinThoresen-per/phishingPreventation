Lynn,

Koch is the agent for IES nominations.

On the accounting side, IES pays their own invoices.  WP&L, Interstate Power=
, IEA and IES are all under Alliant, but they operate independently.

Kathy Washington currently handles the scheduling for IES since she handles =
Koch, and also IES accounting since they pay their own invoices.  However, e=
ach month Kathy Washington gives the IES invoices to Jean to include with Al=
liant's mailout.

Hope this explains everything!

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Renee   J
