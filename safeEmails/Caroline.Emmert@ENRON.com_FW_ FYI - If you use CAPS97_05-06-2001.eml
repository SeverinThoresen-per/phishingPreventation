AT noon o'clock PST I will need to ask that everyone please get out of CAPS =
97 for routine maintenance. The historical and settlement databases will NOT=
 be affected. The purpose for this maintenance will be to help with the lock=
ing issue that we have been experiencing lately. Could you let the rest of t=
he people in your department, who will be affected by this, know that they w=
ill need to get out of CAPS at noon. Also, if this is going to be a MAJOR pr=
oblem for anyone, please let me know so that I may be able to try to work ou=
t something different.

Thanks,
