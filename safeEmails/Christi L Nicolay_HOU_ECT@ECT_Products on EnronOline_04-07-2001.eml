Dave -- Per my voice mail, are you the appropriate person to assist in gathe=
ring this data?  After hearing back from you, I will alert everyone about Ma=
rvin's questions.

Sarah Novosel and I talked with Marvin about his request:

(1)  He prefers to have the "Product Long Description" of the gas and power =
products in "one computer format."
(2)  Enron's response to Kim Bruno's questions stated:  "At the end of each =
day, EnronOnline makes available to all customers through EnronOnline the we=
ighted average price of that day's transactions.  The data associated with U=
S Natural Gas is sent in this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their aut=
omated exchange index."  Marvin wants to know how to find this data on Enron=
Online.
(3) He wants to know who has authority to list and delist products on EnronO=
nline.  In addition, he would like the list of gas and power products that w=
ere available on June 30 and whether any of those products have been "delist=
ed" on July 1 (or why some products may only appear at certain times of the =
month.)

I will be out Thursday, but back on Friday.  Sarah can be reached at 202-466=
-9160.  Thanks for your help.  Christi 37007.
