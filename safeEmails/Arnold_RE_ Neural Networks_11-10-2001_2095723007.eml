John, I can cover that time frame.  I will call you around 3:30 or just drop=
 by if its okay with you. =20

John, here is a power point slide that provides a draft outline of the probl=
em at hand.  It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working vers=
ion over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written for=
mat so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what yo=
u want and not get into broader research, etc....

I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the int=
erface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful f=
or you as phase I product.

I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec=
 doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I=
 will update the document.=20

I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code=
 the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and d=
ifferent curves, etc.

My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensatio=
n indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I =
could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  J=
ohn Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back t=
o work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast m=
arket by supporting John.

I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this jo=
b search. =20

not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  jus=
t for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for f=
ront month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a mont=
h 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ =
month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to creat=
e a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month =
2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical b=
ut very easy for a human to add bias. =20

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject sy=
stem to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to auto=
mate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few pow=
er point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning sy=
stems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including =
actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve build=
ing functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with you=
r own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to =
do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the neces=
sary predictive power. =20
