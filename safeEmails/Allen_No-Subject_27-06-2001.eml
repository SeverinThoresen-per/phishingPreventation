Jacques,

Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes=
 it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Est=
ate.  Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the releas=
e is signed and settled.  Has their attorney contacted you with any revision=
s?  Is the ball in their court?

Phillip
