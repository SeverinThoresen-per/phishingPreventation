		 Subject: In re ICTS

I have received a telefax from Scottsborough, our good customer, which=20
attaches the lawsuit filed by the trucker against it and ICTS, in Alabama=20
state court.  The complaint prays for recovery of about $15,000, plus=20
interest and attorneys' fees.  I was not sent the service papers, which woul=
d=20
allow me to confirm Scottsborough's advice that its "return date" is Decembe=
r=20
16 (a Saturday, so it can't be right).  I was not sent any documents that=20
would allow me to confirm Scottsborough's representation that all the loads=20
(which were allegedly shipped from 4/10-5/23/00) were purchased from MG=20
Metals, freight prepaid.

I am sending a follow-up letter to Scottsborough asking for specific=20
additional documentation, including the service papers; you will be=20
blind-copied on the letter.  I will also have Becky, my legal assistant, (a)=
=20
call the Court to see if process has been issued against ICTS and whether it=
=20
has been served and (b) check on Pacer, the federal bankruptcy database, to=20
see if ICTS has filed for bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, I wonder if Nicole could advise me of/send me the following:

1. a copy of the MG Metals/Scottsborough master agreement, if there is one,=20
