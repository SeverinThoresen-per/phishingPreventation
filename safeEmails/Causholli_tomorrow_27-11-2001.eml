Dave,

I am leaving for Dallas tonight because I arranged a meeting with an interna=
tional advisor at University of Texas tomorrow. She will do an exception for=
 me.
Anyways, I won't be coming to work tomorrow but I will keep in touch.

See you on Wednesday
Thanks for everything,
Monika

Dave,

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time =
to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing m=
e to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January=
=2E Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the=
 date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It woul=
d be great.

Thanks,
Monika
