Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Tra=
ilblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate.  Data checks out.
However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.  I=
t appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included =
in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.  A ballpark estim=
ate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value co=
mpanies were excluded as they were last year.   That would mean a factor of =
19.0% rather than 19.1%.


Please call me when you want to discuss IMP.  I'm not sure exactly what you'=
re looking for so trying to answer by e-mail probably wouldn't be very produ=
ctive.
