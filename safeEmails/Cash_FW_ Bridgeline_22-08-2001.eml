Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?

Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco ha=
ve been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employ=
ment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a fe=
w months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and c=
reating a separate entity.  The assigned employees would be part of the tran=
saction and would become employees of Newco.  How does that impact the quest=
ion below?

Thanks!

Michelle

Barbara,

I have been trying to get a legal question answered and Jeanie Slone suggest=
ed I run the question by you.  Will the Bridgeline "employees" be considered=
 terminated from Enron/Texaco OR will they fall under the Same Desk Rule?  I=
 had assumed that this is a legal question...to be decided by the legal depa=
rtment.  Is that a correct assumption?  Any insight you have would be much a=
ppreciated!

Thanks

As you know this is not a simply question.  On the surface this sounds like =
a 'transfer' from one participating Enron employer to a non-participating En=
ron employer which would mean that the impacted employees are actually termi=
nating one payroll company and being hired by another.  However, you all nee=
d to feret out the exact details and make sure if we know if there is any di=
vestiture issues.  In addition to the 401(k) we need to make sure we know ho=
w the other benefits will be handled.

Please coordinate a call between yourself, Pat Mackin and Sarah to get the s=
pecifics before guidance is provided. =20
Thanks
Cb

We are looking in to rolling over some Enron employees to Bridgeline (payrol=
l + benefits) - for purposes of setting up the 401K I need to know whether t=
he Texaco/Enron employees will be treated as Terminated or whether they will=
 fall under the same desk rule.  I posed this question to legal first (Miche=
lle Cash) and she suggested I ask you. (see below)


Thanks,
