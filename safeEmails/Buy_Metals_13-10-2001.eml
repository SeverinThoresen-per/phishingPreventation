I had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encourag=
ed by the report. Seems like real good progress on all fronts. As400 systems=
 work, var implementation and trading results all seemed positive. Some issu=
es around SAP/AS400 reconciliation but recognized.

Metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list. Grea=
t work to your team.=20
