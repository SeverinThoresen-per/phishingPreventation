I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Kni=
g=20
Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I=20
forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of=20
contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is=20
negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we=20
will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a=20
gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant. =20
HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not b=
e=20
future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned=20
from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything wil=
l=20
be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different=20
counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts=20
and different counterparties.

Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss=20
the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion=
=20
also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper=20
scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we=20
be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling,=20
transport rates and risk are affected.

Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place. =20
