ame about a month ago.  I will have her add it to the list again.  Sheila

		Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name=
 is on the list.
		Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the=
 list
		and added the new people. =20

		Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for =
updates on
		this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up=
?

		Thanks. Lynn
