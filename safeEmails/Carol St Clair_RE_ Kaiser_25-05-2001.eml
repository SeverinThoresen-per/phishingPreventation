Rod:
Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If=20
not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:

 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold

2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of=20
Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its=20
credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In=20
each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.

3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a=20
MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.

4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts


With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if=
=20
it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same=20
Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has=20
appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a=20
Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff=20
rights.


What is the next step?

Hi Carol.  Great to hear from you.  I hope all is going well. =20

Diana Higgins who is a manager (credit) in the metal area will be the=20
principal credit person.  I would say that Kaiser is a low grade credit and=20
the contract should be robust with early termination and collateral rights.

Rod and Paul:
I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setof=
f=20
language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting=20
Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party=20
under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located=20
the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs a=
n=20
answer this morning.

Rod,
If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there=20
other credit issues that need to be considered?
