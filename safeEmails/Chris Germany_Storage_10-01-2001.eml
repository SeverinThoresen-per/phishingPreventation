You are so wonderful.  I am truly privlidged to work with you.

OK.  I would like for you to send Mr. Porter the remaining storage balance=20
every other day and copy me - something like this.

Date  1/7/2001
Balance 3,495,871

And I would do it on a 2 day lag like this, today is the 9th, give him the=20
balance for the 7th.

Or maybe you are doing this already?
