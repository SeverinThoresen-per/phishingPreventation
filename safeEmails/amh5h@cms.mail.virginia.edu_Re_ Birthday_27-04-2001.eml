Hey,

B-day =3D 9/20/73
address =3D I guess 1801 Calvert Street, NW, Apt 408, Wash DC 20009


Finals suck!  I waited until 3rd year to take all of the crappy
litigation courses that I did not care about and did not want to get
graded on early in my law school career.  I decided to take Evidence
and Crim Pro for bar reasons, but I am really struggling!!!   It does
not help that I will never care about these rules in practice!!!
Yuck!!!  And at the same time it is really sad that it is almost
over.  I am not an academic at heart, but I love Charlottesville and
my laid-back life here.  It will be sad to leave.

I look forward to sailing though and that laid-back life.
Wish me luck.

- Amanda
