My thoughts:  I suggest that each Nelson file be assigned by the paralegals =
to an attorney mentor as well as Cheryl and that we ask that Cheryl not send=
 any matters out until reviewed by the particular mentor attorney.  In this =
way we can assure that items are not being externally distributed without re=
view.  I am trying to get with her on all Canada files and have asked that s=
he always check in with me prior to distribution.  However, I think other IS=
DA world matters are being distributed without adequate review.


Cordially,
