On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and =
David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interface=
s.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonst=
ration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with=
 a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test =
and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the follow=
ing:

1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update=
 on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of=
 up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts o=
n the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transac=
tions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product=
 showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStre=
et provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test env=
ironment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated=
 that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We re=
viewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active=
 and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing tr=
ansactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago =
Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and of=
fer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have result=
ed in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid a=
nd/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not=
 reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many =
cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we d=
id not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may=
 or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of beh=
avior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a tra=
nsaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a dis=
appearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated b=
y HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dat=
ed 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned t=
heir database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginni=
ng at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliat=
ion of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If=
 the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exp=
osure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterpa=
rty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:

			HSE	EOL

	Arizona		 12	 14
	Avista		 03	 03
	Adams		 17	 19
	BP		 57	 58
=09
	Total		 89	 94
=09
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there signi=
ficant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.
