Don:
Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.

Delivery:  '00-'01  Cost:  $36.0 MM
Delivery:  '98-'99  Cost:  $34.250 MM
Delivery:  '96-'97  Cost:  $32.0 MM=20
Delivery:  '95-'97  Cost:  $30.0 MM

It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx. $2.0=20
MM.  The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr. 2003.
