Someone from Rick Buy's Risk Management group will be calling you to schedul=
e a visit to discuss with your team the procedures and strategy PGE has in p=
lace to manage the variability of our net variable power costs.  Since Rick'=
s group is  a corporate Risk Management group there should be no market affi=
liate issues.  The visit will enable us Houstonians to get even a better han=
dle on the risk profile of your business given the tremendous volatility we =
have experienced in power prices.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks in advance for your cooperati=
on.
