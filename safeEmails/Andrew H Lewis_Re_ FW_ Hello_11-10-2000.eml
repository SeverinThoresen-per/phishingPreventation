Hey,

It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and=20
Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a=20
chance to get up to speed.

Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go=20
to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of=20
anything I will let you know.

Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time. =20
