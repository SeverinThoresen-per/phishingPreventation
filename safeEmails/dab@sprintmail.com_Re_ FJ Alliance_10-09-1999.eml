Kevin,

Good point with Naheola Energy Island, but this may also apply to several=20
other
energy projects that have occurred over the past two years.  The Kzoo Steam
Turbines, the RO Project at Marathon, etc...

Also Kevin and Richard given the fact that Naheola was not a wholly owned=20
asset by
FJ (50%), but rather an LLP with another party (Utilico) - is this asset in=20
any
way exempt from the Alliance Agreement from FJ's perspective?

Thanks

David
