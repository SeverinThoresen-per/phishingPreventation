Currently, we have been working to finalize the accuracy of the data in that=
 report.  John has been given access to the report to initially provide feed=
back on the format.  We have not given access to Greg Whalley or Rick Buy ei=
ther,  as we wanted to be sure of the accuracy of the data.  We can go ahead=
 and give you access now if you would like, and we will let you know when th=
e report is final.  (Within a week)

Please let me know if there are any other reports you need access to.

Thanks,

Attached please find the list of reports that you have had access to.  On th=
e home page each of these reports should be "blue" and any reports you do no=
t have access to should be in "black".  Please let me know which reports not=
 listed in the attachment you should have access to.

I apologize of any inconveniences.
