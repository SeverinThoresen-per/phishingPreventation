Dick,

Just spoke with Peter Cardellichio at RISI who is the person in charge oh As=
ia and he told me that their forecast for Japan is based on the European pri=
ces. He said that prices in Europe and Japan have been pretty close historic=
ally thus he uses European prices as a base and adjusts thoem based on what =
is happening to Asia.

Hope this helps,
Monika
