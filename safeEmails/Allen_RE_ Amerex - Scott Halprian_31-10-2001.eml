Andy,

I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice en=
ough as far as brokers go.  Personally, I am extremely pleased with the tran=
sition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done =
online.  If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some =
pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set =
up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here =
in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Andy
