This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may=
 have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to=
 be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type lan=
guage here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, sharehold=
ers, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also =
like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys. =20
