David Jones in East Gas Origination completed a transportation management tr=
ansaction with Yankee Gas last night.  This negotiation has been ongoing but=
 the values and the structure have, until yesterday been extremely volatile.=
  David was able to bring the client to the table yesterday and complete the=
 deal.  It is only a Nov 01 - Mar 02 term but should book orig of $400,000 +=
=2E  This was not on the hotlist due to the uncertainty that had been surrou=
nding its completion.  Yankee has worked this transaction with Engage for th=
e past several years, it is good to get one of these coming our way.
