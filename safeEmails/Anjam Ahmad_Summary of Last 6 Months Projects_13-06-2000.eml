Dear Dale, Stinson & Vince,

I would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to=20
summarise the projects of the past six months.  Firstly, by all accounts it=20
has been an amazing few months for me - I believe that I have kept a large=20
number of commercial group heads very happy.  However, not all are aware of=20
my activities, so, many people (e.g. John Sherriff, Richard Lewis, Steve=20
Young etc.) will not know of everything I have done.  For example the amount=
=20
of work that I put into the inflation models and the extent to which I was=20
critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent=20
impact (o7+ million for Q1) and similar large P&L swings for Eastern contrac=
t=20
optionality (short virtual power station) based upon my UK Power Vol Curve=20
Generator.

For your benefit, I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on=
=20
over the past five/six months:

1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March + April internal audit +=20
June external audit)
2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator & ideas for half-hourly vol curve
3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
4) Energydesk.com models & support
5) Real Options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g. Wessex deal,=20
Anti-Freeze project)
6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified=20
distributions)
7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward=20
curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha)
8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old=
=20
Asian models)
9) Continental gas volatility curve construction
10) Communication objective I: two presentations to Enron Europe staff, one=20
to Oslo office
11) Communication objective II: meetings to gather information and present=20
results
12) FAS 133: working with internal and external auditors on matching=20
financial and physical (accrual) hedges - hedge effectiveness
13) Oslo trip: bringing Oslo up to speed on EXOTICA and option valuation
14) Houston Research staff: co-ordinating communication/meetings to maximise=
=20
productivity
15) Valuation/Marketing of Power put options for banks that hold senior and=20
sub debt in merchant power plant

I believe I have kept as many commercial groups happy as is possible; it is=20

I can continue to help enhance earnings going forward.
