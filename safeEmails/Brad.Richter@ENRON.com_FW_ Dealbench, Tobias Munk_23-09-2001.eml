Hi Don,=20

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me=
 to raise VC money I need to show client business.

If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is loo=
king to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a s=
ubstantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the pr=
ocess. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific =
or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail=20

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com=20

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successf=
ul divestitures :-)=20

Tobias Munk=20
