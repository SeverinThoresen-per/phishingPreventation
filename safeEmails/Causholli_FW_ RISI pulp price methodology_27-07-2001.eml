Dick, I know Elizabeth gave you a copy of a fax RISI sent her about their pu=
lp price methodology. To supplement that fax I called Rod Young and he gave =
me the following information.

Over the course of the year they talk to about 30 buyers and 30 producers fo=
r their U.S. NBSK price (Table 5). This list represents about 80% of the sel=
l side and 75% of the buy side.
However, in a given month their sample is much smaller. In a typical month t=
hey talk to 5-10 buyers and 5-10 suppliers, who probably represent 20-25% of=
 the buy and sell side. However, Rod said if they get exactly the same price=
 from the first three buyers and the first three sellers, they stop their in=
terviewing at that time and use that price.
Their call list covers a variety of sizes of buyer and seller, from very lar=
ge to very small. I couldn't get more details.
Regionally they talk to producers from all major regions including West, Can=
ada and the South. They talk to buyers from all regions but the emphasis is =
on the northern and central U.S., where the largest focus of consumption is =
located. They believe their sample is reasonably well balanced according to =
where production and consumption take place.

Monika will be speaking to Timo Teras at FOEX to as similar questions about =
their methodology.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Dave
