ch is how it was approved here in Houston by Mark Haedicke (EWS Mangaing Dir=
ector & General Counsel), et al.

Attached is the Employment Agreement for Matthias Lee, for your approval. Do=
 let us know when you have presented to Matt so that we could give him the o=
riginal to sign and thereafter, send to Houston for your signature.
 << File: Executive Agreement_SIN_Matthias Lee.doc >>=20

Need your advice on the effective date of the agreement. Tentatively, i have=
 used 15 May, given that this is the date for changes in title, salary, etc.=
