Shari:

I need your thoughts on 2 things:

We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and=20
Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some=20
modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications=20
were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think tha=
t=20
this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to=20
hearing from you.

Carol
