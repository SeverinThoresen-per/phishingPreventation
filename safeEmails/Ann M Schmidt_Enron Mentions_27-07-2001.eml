Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western=20
U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant=20
developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be=20
enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter.=20
The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators -=20
high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have=
=20
cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts,=
=20
about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and wester=
n=20
Montana.
"The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for=20
Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to=20
this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we hav=
e=20
concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of=20
having rotating outages in the region."=20
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limit=
s=20
on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of =
a=20
new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power=20
plant.=20
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers'=20
needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of=20
hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could=
=20
power about 45,000 homes.=20
"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said.=20
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended=20
negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was=
=20
ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and=20
Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply=20
shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market an=
d=20
had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%.=20
But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no=
=20
reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the=20
FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot=20
market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in=20
Washington that could have added 300 megawatts.=20
FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have=20
dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open=20
market in the past few months.=20
The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers=
=20
the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking=20
turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In=
=20
addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower=20
level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut i=
n=20
half since the cap was first formulated in June.=20

Not Everyone Blames FERC=20

The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August=20
through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three month=
s=20
ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's=20
price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the=
=20
market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants=20
are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and=20
consumers are conserving electricity.=20
Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO)=20
merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the=20
cancellation of projects to price controls.=20
"I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said. "The=20
market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we wil=
l=20
find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is=20
sending now."=20
The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two=20
months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout=20
the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except fo=
r=20
a few hours so far this summer.=20
"Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said=20
Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. "The=20
need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling."=20
Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the=20
winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze.=20
Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in=20
cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is=20
continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington,=20
because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago.=20
"The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed=20
within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director wit=
h=20
the Northwest Power Planning Council.=20
Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap.=
=20
Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's=20
efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity."=20
As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more=
=20
expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even=
=20
been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six=20
months. And orders for new generators have been canceled.=20

ENRON CANCELS MIAMI-DADE PLAN POWER PLANT BUILDER FAVORS DEERFIELD SITE

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Enron Corp. is focusing its energies on building a power plant in Deerfield=20
Beach now that it has canceled construction plans for a site in far south=20
Miami-Dade County, a company spokesperson said Wednesday.=20
"We're not renewing our option on the Miami-Dade property," said Lea Sooter=20
in a telephone interview from Enron headquarters in Houston. "This makes=20
Deerfield Beach that much more important to the citizens of Florida. I don't=
=20
know what the big picture is for Florida, but there is a definite need for=20
power."
But Sooter refused to conclusively rule out the possibility Enron could=20
someday build on another site not far away in south Miami- Dade. She=20
acknowledged that a company project manager met with officials of Homestead,=
=20
a city faced with severe financial problems. But nothing came of the meeting=
=2E=20
"We were approached by the city of Homestead, and were listening to what the=
y=20
could bring to the table," she said in a prior interview. "We do that all th=
e=20
time on projects that never get developed."=20
Charles LaPradd, Homestead's communications and project manager, said city=20
officials had no specific site in mind, but let Enron know the company would=
=20
be welcome in the city that has its own power plant.=20
"It never went anywhere, but it's still open," LaPradd said. "It was a `we'r=
e=20
here' kind of thing. We showed our power plant to them. It's always good to=20
have backup. We have three of our 16 main generators down."=20
The Deerfield Beach project is currently stalled. Given the go- ahead in Jun=
e=20
by the city's Development Review Committee, it was put on hold last week whe=
n=20
the Broward County Commission imposed a moratorium on new power-plant=20
construction. Enron officials said the company was considering legal action=20
as well as trying to convince the state Department of Environmental=20
Protection to intervene.=20
The moratorium, enforced by denying the air-quality operating permits are=20
required for power plants, is to end May 1.=20
Sooter said Enron's Miami-Dade decision was based on which site would best=20
serve the public interest.=20
"It is not unusual for us to look at multiple sites and choose to build on=20
the one that is going to work best for everyone," she said.=20
The action clears the way for Miami-Dade's Department of Environmental=20
Resources Management to close a construction landfill near the 61-acre site=20
at Southwest 256th Street and 97th Avenue, east of the Homestead Extension o=
f=20
the Florida Turnpike.=20
Environmentalists and residents of the nearby Lakes of the Bay neighborhood=20
vehemently opposed the project. But Sooter said that opposition had nothing=20

"Enron wants to be seen as the good guys," she said. "The primary benefit we=

Rove's First Step Toward Shedding Stock Took 5 Months
George Lardner Jr.
Washington Post Staff Writer

07/26/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
A04
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Shortly before he was named as President Bush's senior adviser in January,=20
Karl Rove met with a transition team lawyer who took a look at Rove's stock=20
portfolio, heavy with companies that do business with the government, and=20
told him he would probably have to sell.=20
"He wanted it cleaned up as fast as he could," said the lawyer, Fred=20
Fielding. "He didn't want the bother." But Fielding advised Rove to wait=20
until he obtained a certificate of divestiture from government lawyers -- a=20
determination that the stocks did, indeed, pose a conflict -- in order to=20
defer paying capital gains taxes.
Yet, it took more than five months for that step to occur, and, in the=20
meantime, Rove met with officials or trade association representatives of at=
=20
least six of the companies in which he said he had more than $100,000 worth=20
of stock: Intel, Enron, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and=20
Cisco.=20
Given Rove's preeminent position in the Bush White House and the size of his=
=20
holdings, those meetings have generated the very trouble Rove had said he=20
wanted to avoid. Democrats have seized on the meetings to accuse the=20
administration of the kind of ethical lapses that Republicans were quick to=20
jump on during the Clinton administration, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman=20
(D-Calif.) has demanded that Rove's conduct be referred to the Justice=20
Department.=20
Republicans have said the controversy smells of political payback -- "puttin=
g=20
politics before the facts," White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said of Waxma=
n=20
-- and dismissed suggestions that the meetings constituted a conflict of=20
interest.=20
In a June 29 letter to Waxman, White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales=20
defended Rove, saying that he "either had passing, inconsequential contacts"=
=20
with some of the companies in his portfolio "or participated in broad policy=
=20
discussions" on issues affecting them, such as energy policy. None of this,=20
Gonzales said, "presents an ethical problem under applicable regulations."=20
But several ethics experts said they thought that determination should be=20
made by the Justice Department, not the White House, although they said they=
=20
doubted a review would result in anything more than a civil penalty, if that=
=2E=20
One expert, a Republican who asked that his name not be used, blamed White=20
House lawyers for political ineptitude in failing to see that "top guys" lik=
e=20
Rove should have been given priority instead of being kept waiting for weeks=
=20
while lower-ranking staffers had their holdings reviewed.=20
"If the system had worked efficiently, within a short period of time, a=20
certificate of divestiture would have been issued, [Rove's] stock sold, and=20
that would have been it," the source said. "A lot of forms have to be=20
reviewed, but if there are problems, most of them are going to wind up on th=
e=20
Fed Page. If the chief of staff or senior political adviser gets into=20
trouble, it's Page One."=20
Under the federal conflict-of-interest law, it is a crime for any government=
=20
official to take part "personally and substantially" in a government action=20
about any "particular matter" in which he or she has a financial interest.=20
Regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics cover appearances of a=
=20
conflict, or situations that would not violate the criminal law but "would=20
raise a question in the mind of a reasonable person about [the official's]=20
impartiality." Failing to meet that standard can result in a reprimand,=20
suspension or dismissal.=20
President Bush told his staff at its swearing-in ceremony Jan. 22 that he=20
expected "every member of this administration to stay well within the=20
boundaries that define ethical and legal conduct. This means avoiding even=20
the appearance of problems."=20
According to the White House, lawyers from the counsel's office met with Rov=
e=20
in early April and again April 24 to inform him of several options he had in=
=20
addition to selling his stocks. White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said=20
these included seeking waivers that would have allowed him to participate=20
despite a conflict or selling his stocks down to permissible "threshold=20
levels."=20
Rove said he still wanted to sell everything and the lawyers started working=
=20
on an application for a certificate of divestiture. Under OGE guidelines, it=
=20
amounted to an affirmation on Rove's part that he had to sell the stocks "to=
=20
eliminate or prevent a conflict of interest."=20
Waxman said last week that the White House did not have the power to judge=20
Rove's conduct. He cited the federal law requiring that executive branch=20
departments, including the White House, report to the Justice Department "an=
y=20
information" relating to criminal violations by an employee.=20
"Congress appropriately believed that the Department of Justice would be in =
a=20
better position to render an impartial judgment than the employee's own=20
department or agency," Waxman wrote.=20
The Clinton White House was boxed in by that law on two occasions. Former=20
White House counsel Abner Mikva said he was forced to ask the Justice=20
Department whether national security advisers Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger and=20
Anthony Lake had violated conflict-of-interest rules by failing to dispose o=
f=20
certain stocks after being told to do so.=20
Mikva said he viewed the violations as technical and completely=20
unintentional, but under the law he had no choice. "They had stock in a=20
couple of oil companies, nothing approaching a significant holding," Mikva,=20
now a law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an interview.=20
Berger and Lake "never met with the individual companies, but they were=20
dealing with the energy crisis," Mikva said. "Beth Nolan [Mikva's deputy]=20
brought it to my attention. She said, 'You've got to turn this over to=20
Justice.' I said, 'This is ridiculous.' She said, 'The law is very clear; we=
=20
have no discretion.' "=20
In Berger's case, he was told by White House lawyers to sell 1,500 shares of=
=20
Amoco Corp. that had been held for years in a trust established by his wife'=
s=20
grandfather. He was reluctant, fearing a stiff tax for stocks held so long,=20
but he was informed in March 1994 that he had to sell since he was involved=20
in questions about whether to keep sanctions on Iraq and Libya, policy=20
decisions that could affect his stock. He was told he could defer his capita=
l=20
gains taxes by using the proceeds to buy "permitted property" such as an=20
open-end mutual fund.=20
Berger agreed to sell, but then, sources have said, forgot to do so until=20
White House lawyers prodded him in mid-June 1995.=20
Lake was "even more innocent," Mikva said. Lake was told in 1993 to sell=20
stock in four energy companies -- Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Duke Power Co.=20
and TECO Energy Inc., because he would be making decisions on energy policy=20

the most controversy because they brought up a merger application that they=20

Gonzales said Rove was "noncommittal and offered no substantive response."=20
The White House counsel said the matter was in the hands of an interagency=20

=20
but I don't think this violates the rule."=20
Another ethics specialist, Monroe Freedman, disagreed, saying Rove created=20
"an appearance of impropriety" simply by meeting with Intel when he held mor=
e=20
than $100,000 worth of stock in the company.=20
"The problem you have is that a reasonable person would question the=20
propriety of what went on," Freedman said. "We are not required to accept=20
what they say about their meeting not having anything of substance to it."=20
Gonzales said Rove sought no waivers because he "took care to avoid" any=20
direct participation in matters that would have required one. Gonzales did=20

spokesman Bartlett said Rove rejects the notion that he had created one.=20

Insider Selling by Enron Execs Speaks Louder Than Their Words=20
By Christopher Edmonds  <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>
Special to TheStreet.com

At Enron, actions are speaking differently than words.=20
At the same time as Enron Chairman Ken Lay and Enron President and CEO Jeff=20
Skilling were touting their company's stock as undervalued, both were in the=
=20
process of selling hundreds of thousands of shares.=20
In an exclusive interview </comment/streetsidechat/1186095.html> with=20
TheStreet.com last November, Lay suggested that Enron stock -- then trading=20
in the mid-$70s at nearly 50 times earnings -- was undervalued. "Comfortable=
=20
that it's worth that [50 times earnings], yes," he said. "As a matter of=20
fact, some of us here and, of course, many analysts would maintain that even=
=20
that is undervaluing the company."=20
Yet, since the beginning of the year, Lay has simultaneously exercised and=20
sold nearly 400,000 shares, continuing a program of exercising options and=20
selling the shares that dates back to last November. This year's sales were=20
all at prices below the November prices at which he said the shares were=20
undervalued. According to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call,=20
Lay's options transactions occurred between $52.95 and $82 a share.=20
In February, Lay stepped down as Enron's CEO, retaining the title of=20
chairman.=20
Skilling's words and actions were similar. During a January analysts and=20
investors meeting in Houston, Skilling said he believed Enron stock was wort=
h=20
$126 a share. At the same time, he was in the middle of completing sales of=20
130,000 shares of Enron stock he registered in November 2000. Since January,=
=20
Skilling has registered for sale an additional 270,000 shares of Enron. And=20
since the first of the year, he has sold stock at between $52.95 and $80.57 =
a=20
share.=20
Both Lay and Skilling still hold large positions in Enron. As of May 30, Lay=
=20
and his family reportedly owned more than 2.66 million shares, and Skilling=20
controlled more than 1.1 million shares. They each acquired more than 100,00=
0=20
shares from the company in January.=20
Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer says the sales are "program sales" that=20
involve the exercise of expiring options and the sale of stock to cover the=20
costs and tax liability, a common practice among executives at many major=20
corporations.=20
And, Palmer notes that Enron's compensation makes such sales almost routine.=
=20
"A very significant portion of senior management's compensation is paid in=20
equity," he says.=20
Mixed Messages
Analysts and investors worry about the messages such high-level insider sale=
s=20
send, especially when at the same time executives are touting the stock's=20
appealing value. "Certainly, it's a concern to see the chief executive=20
selling so aggressively," says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., a=20
Houston energy investment boutique and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable=
=2E=20
</comment/streetsidechat/1242533.html> "Especially when they are saying the=20
stock is undervalued. That sends a very mixed message to investors."=20
While acknowledging Enron's unique equity-based compensation program, Dieter=
t=20
says recent selling at the top is unique. "You constantly see a regular grou=
p=20
of people selling as they monetize their compensation" at Enron, he says.=20
"However, the larger sales from senior executives are different. Sales have=20
been weighted much more heavily to Lay and Skilling than they have been in=20
the past."=20
Dietert's 12-month price for Enron is $58, and his firm has not provided=20
banking services to Enron. Simmons does not rate companies.=20
Another analyst who asked not to be named was more critical. "The [insider=20
sales] are disconcerting to say the least. In a market like this where the=20
slightest indication of lack of confidence sends a stock down precipitously,=
=20
their actions are speaking louder than their words."=20
Dream vs. Reality
One reason for the mixed messages may have been the company's belief in=20
broadband. At the time Skilling made his now famous $126 tout, he indicated=20
that nearly $40 of value would come from Enron's now flailing broadband=20
business. As my colleagues Adam Lashinsky=20
</comment/siliconstreet/1489696.html> and Peter Eavis=20
</comment/detox/1489630.html> have aptly chronicled, Enron's great dream for=
=20
broadband turned into a nightmare.=20
"The world certainly looks a lot different today than it did in January,=20
especially to Enron," says Tom McIntyre, president of Dessauer & McIntyre=20
Asset Management, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser. "You sure don't=20
see projections from anyone assigning value to broadband now." In fact, on=20
Enron's second-quarter earnings call, Skilling lamented the fact that=20
investors seem to be assigning negative value to the company's telecom=20
operations. McIntyre holds a long position in Enron.=20
Still, investors might have expected Skilling's words to be backed by his=20
actions. When he made the bullish comments in January, Skilling was selling=20
stock even though the shares were trading near $80 a share, a 57% discount t=
o=20
his target price. That led the analyst to quip, "If it's not an expensive=20
stock, why are they out there selling it?"=20
To others, however, the sales are just noise that distracts from a solid=20
growth story. "You would prefer it if they would never sell," says McIntyre.=
=20
"I'd rather watch them hold the shares like I do. However, [Skilling] still=20
owns well over a million shares, and the consistent sales suggest they have =
a=20
program to sell whether the stock is near its high or at its lows." (Records=
=20
show that Skilling has been selling 10,000 shares each week since=20
mid-November.)=20
The two executives "have a long record of creating and sustaining value for=20
shareholders. I have a high level of confidence that Skilling can continue=20
that record," McIntyre said.=20
But appearances count. "It's a question of perceptions," says McIntyre. "In=20
this market, anything can get a company, and the insider-sales news does=20
hurt."=20
That's especially true when actions and words don't mesh. As the analyst=20
quipped, "It's what they call an oxymoron. You are saying one thing and doin=
g=20
another."=20


Enron's Own Dot-Com Bubble Finally Popped=20

Enron (ENE <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=3DENE>:NYSE)=
 is=20
no longer an Internet company.=20
Of course, the Houston-based energy distribution and trading concern never=20
was a dot-com, though it tried to convince Wall Street it was. In early 2000=
,=20
Enron went so far as to suggest to investors the precise value of its nascen=
t=20
money-losing bandwidth business. Wall Street obediently obliged, inflating=20
Enron's share value by as much as 75% from the time the company started=20
bragging about its prospects, a disconnect noted disapprovingly here=20
</comment/siliconstreet/928870.html> a year ago April.=20
Now that dot-com valuations have gone the way of full-service gas stations,=20
Enron is finally owning up to reality regarding the broadband business. "It'=
s=20
like someone turned off the light switch," Enron President and CEO Jeffrey=20
Skilling told investors Thursday morning while announcing an otherwise solid=
=20
quarter. "Revenue opportunities have just dried up."=20
Indeed, Enron recorded a $109 million loss related to its broadband=20
businesses, compared with income before interest, minority interest and taxe=
s=20
of $17 million in the year-earlier period. Skilling noted that Enron would=20
dramatically scale back the burn rate for its broadband business and that th=
e=20
expectations for resuming progress in this market have been pushed back by a=
t=20
least a year.=20
The story was so different a year and a half ago. With Enron's shares tradin=
g=20
in the low 50s, Enron convinced analysts -- who openly admitted their=20
ignorance of the telecommunications issues important to the broadband market=
=20
-- that bandwidth delivery opportunities were huge. Enron cajoled the stock=20
price into the $90s by August, after telling analysts that the broadband=20
business alone was worth $37 per share, or $27 billion.=20
Today, despite sound performance in its key, wholesale energy-distribution=20
business, Enron's shares are worth $49.55. Even Wall Street, convinced=20
perhaps that the prospects for an IPO of the once-hot Internet operations ar=
e=20
totally dead, has gone back to analyzing energy prospects.=20
Ronald Barone, a "natural gas/energy convergence" analyst with UBS Warburg i=
n=20
New York, lowered his price target Thursday on Enron from $102 to $70. In a=20
report, he noted that his earlier projected price applied a multiple of 40 t=
o=20
his previous 2002 earnings target of $2.10 per share and $17 worth of value=20
for broadband services. Now Barone assumes 32 to 33 times estimated 2002=20
per-share earnings of $2.15 (the same EPS estimate CEO Skilling offered on=20
Thursday's conference call) and zero value for broadband.=20
Enron must be one of the most promotional companies on the planet. If=20
investors played the old Bob Newhart drinking game and had to refill their=20
mugs every time Skilling said "outstanding" in relation to second-quarter=20
performance, they would have been drunk before the question-and-answer=20
session. But Skilling doesn't like the new reality.=20
"Everything has been taken out of our stock for the bandwidth business," he=20
correctly observed. "We are probably getting a negative impact on the stock,=
=20
and I don't think that's right."=20
Interestingly, as recently as January, management at Enron suggested to Wall=
=20
Street that its discounted cash-flow models suggested a value of $126 for th=
e=20
stock, including $40 a share for the broadband business. Why companies feel=20
it's proper even to comment on their own stock prices is a wonder. Skilling=20
had nothing to say about the $126 valuation, and analysts didn't query him=20
about it.=20
Oh, it's right all right. No longer the bright shining prospect, broadband i=
s=20
a real drag on the company now, albeit a small one. Robert Franson, an=20
analyst with Bear Stearns in New York, notes that the old IPO rumor has been=
=20
replaced by one suggesting Enron will sell or lease its broadband network=20
while maintaining the services businesses built around it. "One great thing=20
about Enron is that it is constantly getting out of businesses that aren't=20
right," he says.=20
Bear Stearns had the luxury of initiating coverage on Enron only in December=
,=20
so it was able to sidestep the trap of perceived value to the broadband=20
business. Donato Eassey of Merrill Lynch is hanging on to hope. "We believe=20
Enron at current prices offers investors a free call option on the future of=
=20
broadband, and the ultimate turnaround in the telecom market once it occurs,=
"=20
he told clients in a report. Eassey has a price target of $74.50 on Enron's=20
shares.=20
For what it's worth, in April 2000 Enron traded for about 43 times Wall=20
Street's 2001 earnings estimates of about $1.65 per share. Now the company=20
predicts 2001 EPS of $1.80 (showing the success of its main wholesale=20
business), and is valued at about 23 times its own 2002 earnings estimates.=20
It's worth noting that Enron is a good example of a company that has taken=20
advantage of the Internet. Skilling said 60% of the company's transactions=20
occurred on the Internet in the second quarter. That's impressive, but no=20
more so than all the business Dell or Cisco does online. Efficient use of=20
Internet infrastructure does not an Internet company make.=20
Interestly, Enron is in much better shape than the upstart companies to whic=
h=20
it eagerly compared itself 18 months ago in justifying a higher valuation. B=
y=20
giving up all of the hype-driven market value it received from gullible=20
investors with dot-com stardust in their eyes, Enron merely is back to about=
=20
where it belongs, or, as Skilling argues, perhaps a little lower. Comparable=
=20
stand-alone "bandwidth" companies like Akamai and Exodus have given up most=20
of their boom-time value.=20
Enron prudently says it will maintain a stake in the ground of broadband=20
services so it can benefit when the market materializes. Perhaps when that=20
happens, Wall Street will value the incremental business for what it's worth=
,=20
not what they dream it's worth.=20
