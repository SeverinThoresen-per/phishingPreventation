Hi Britt:
Greetings from Singapore.  I'm slowly getting over my jet-lag.  It's great t=
o=20
be here and I'm looking forward to the rest of my stay.  On the Pacific Virg=
o=20
front I wanted to forward to you Paul Henking's views to get your comments. =
=20
Also, I talked to Neale Gregson today and he is very opposed to the selectio=
n=20
of Mark Hamsher as the arbitrator since in his experience Mark has been a=20
maverick and is not a lawyer. Neale believes we need a Queen's Counsel as an=
=20
arbitrator. Neale will be discussing this issue with David Best tonight. =20
Thanks again for that great lunch!
Best regards,
Mike

matt/mike,

tried to call matsuru/mitsubishi this afternoon but he was in a meeting. i=20
will try later and let you know if i get hold of him.

in the meantime, i do have some concerns with mitsubishi taking us to=20
arbitration for the outstanding frt and demurrage we owe on the pacific=20
virgo. if this goes to arbitration, i am sure we will lose and have to pay=20
the amounts due. i understand a decision has to be made before the end of=20
this week.

of course, going to arbitration would give us the opportunity to present our=
=20
claim for the contamination as a counter claim. however, i feel sure the=20
arbitrators will say pay the freight/demurrage now and make the claim a=20
separate issue.

from below, our insurance company has been advised of the contamination clai=
m=20
and i feel this is a valid claim. obviously, we loaded one spec which was in=
=20
order and the vessel arrived with a different spec.  however, rather than=20
going to arbitration and incurring additional expenses, i feel we should be=20
letting the insurance company handle this with the owner's insurance company=
=20

granted, with the insurance companies, this could, and probably would, take=20
some time (1-2 years) and we may still not get money out of it if the owners=
=20
can prove their position. however, going to arbitration may not be any more=20
successful and would be final.

in summary, i would suggest paying the outstanding freight with advices to=20
mitsubishi that we will turn our attention to the demurrage claim and revert=
=20
by the end of the month. there is a big difference in going to arb for=20
$760,000 vs. only $259,000. this advice would be without prejudice to our=20
contamination claim which will now increase by the amount of the freight and=
=20
the amount of the demurrage.

at the same time, we should advise the insurance company that we have been=20
unsuccessful in negotiating any settlement by offset of freight and demurrag=
e=20
and request they proceed with the contamination claim against the owners. we=
=20
can send them the letter legal/i sent to mitsubishi outlining our claim=20
mentioning that this amount will now increase due to the freight and=20
demurrage costs.

you may want to discuss this with britt davies but i see no way we will win=20
on the freight payment issue if this goes to arbitration.
