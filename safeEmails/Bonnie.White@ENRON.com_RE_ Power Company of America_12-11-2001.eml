I received another call from Robert Minkoff on Friday, 11/09.  His company i=
s interested in purchasing EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I know that =
we have filed a claim for $1million plus, but that PCA had filed an adversar=
y for an even larger amount.  Your reply to my last e-mail indicates that we=
 settled the adversary.  Did we have to give up all or part of our claim to =
do that, or do we still hold a claim for any amount?  If we still have a cla=
im, do you have any interest in selling it to a claims broker.  If not, let =
me know so that I can call him and tell him so that he will not continue to =
call.  Thanks for your help!

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interest=
ed in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involve=
ment in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass =
along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any int=
erest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

Thanks.=20
