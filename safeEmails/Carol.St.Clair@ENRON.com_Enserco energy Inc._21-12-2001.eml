Bill:
Here is what Enserco is willing to do:

They are willing to extend the term of the $million LC to January 31st if we=
 agree to extend the January due dates on settlement payments for physical g=
as and financial trades to January 31st.  They believe that they have a good=
 argument against our right to declare an Event of Default based on their fa=
ilure to renew and the LC will expire on 12/31.  It is questionable under th=
e ISDA whether they are required to renew while we are in default.

Leslie:

I need to know what payments are owed in December and January between ENA an=
d Enserco for physical gas and financial trades under the ISDA.

Lisa, Julia and Lou:
Would EY need to approve this?
