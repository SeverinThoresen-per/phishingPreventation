I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I=
 am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to i=
nstall EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.  =20

	The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the=
 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically ba=
sed on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is imp=
ossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decre=
asing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the=
 third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to in=
stall EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index re=
adings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these typ=
es of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than mont=
hly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does=
 not meet today?s business needs, so we probably need to determine where the=
se deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
	Thanks-
	Gary

			Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they=
 have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why w=
e couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the tota=
l for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get th=
e daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter ti=
me, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices whic=
h are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical=
 volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If t=
hese charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can=
=2E Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have a=
ccurate daily volumes for these stations.

			Thanks,

			Raetta

				Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this=
 week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalt=
y gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stres=
sed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average da=
ily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the=
 problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott =20

				I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which tot=
al $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the in=
voice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on M=
arch 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us kno=
w what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they ar=
e concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those co=
rrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to he=
lp.

				Thanks,

				Raetta

				I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, =
Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was be=
ing charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume=
 statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March =
Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of th=
e actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and=
 Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.=
  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, =
Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge=
 that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270=
