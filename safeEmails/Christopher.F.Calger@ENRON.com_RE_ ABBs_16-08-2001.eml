I spoke with LeDain in Calgary.  They had a bid for C$3MM w/out the ABB turb=
ines.  They are not planning to pursue because Lavorato commented that it is=
 better to hold onto the site at that price.  The site is permitted for the =
ABB's.  I have asked LeDain to send me their original info memo for the sale=
 of the site (w/ turbines); it might be worth trying to market that project =
again - time has passed, the market there may open soon, Ontario just set a =
new peak and East prices rallied last week.

Can you confirm that we are still talking to the guys in Canada with regard =
to selling the ABBs with the Moore site.  I only mention this as the 'hotlis=
t' shows that they are planning to sell the site which I am not sure is feas=
ible without combining the turbines.

Thanks

Louise
