Louise,

Theresa Vos will ask you to authorize a wire request for $100,000 for the Ro=
seville.  This payment is required to keep the agreement with the muni alive=
 which protects $5MM - $15MM of value for the creditors.  A plan for monetiz=
ation of this and other West positions is being pursued (we have $1.1MM comi=
ng in this month for ERC sales).  I recommend we fund this $100,000 payment.
