Gerald,

I reviewed the guaranty.  There are some legal issues that must be approved=20
by Jim Derrick.  The first is the lack of carve out for indirect damages and=
=20
the second is the choice of law and jurisdiction provision.  I personally am=
=20
opposed to the form being presented and the fact that we either execute it o=
r=20
we don't play.  However, the final acceptance of the guarantee is not my=20
call.  The process of obtaining approval from Mr. Derrick is as follows: (1)=
=20
He requires that a lawyer from the legal group representing the business uni=
t=20
draft up a short memo for his attention describing the deal, the specific=20
provisions that are in opposition to Enron Corp. policy (here, it would be=20
indirect damages and choice of law/jurisdiction) and the business=20
justification for doing so.  For a faster response, it is recommended that=20
the lawyer also leave a voice mail message for Mr. Derrick briefly describin=
g=20
the issues.  He is pretty quick in returning responses.  I believe that he=20
will be out of the office until Monday, but can be reached by voice mail.  I=
f=20
and when approved, it is suggested that Mr. Derrick also leave me a voice=20
mail message indicating his approval.  Once done, I can intial off on the=20
guarantee and will add a copy of the memo to the Guarantee file (you can als=
o=20
send to me a copy of the memo).  Let me know if you have any questions.

Clement
