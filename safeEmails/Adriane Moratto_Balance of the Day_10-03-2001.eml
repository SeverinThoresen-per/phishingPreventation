Teresa and I have split up the list you have given us.  I have contacted all=
=20
those from PSEG to CALPINE.  I did not contact TRANSALTA, NRG, or SELECT=20
because I did not have names.  If you have contacts for these three=20
counterparties please give them to me and I will be happy to call.

Everyone I spoke to was extremely excited and interested in the balance of=20
the day.  Three or four had already heard about it and were just waiting for=
=20
launch.  One question I repeatedly received was "Will deals be available=20
every hour or just sporadically during the day"?  I explained that both PJM=20
and NEPOOL will be updated hourly and refresh automatically.  I also=20
explained that these two products were purely financial and left my name and=
=20
number for any problems transacting. =20

I am sending EnronOnline shirts to PSEG, RELIANT, SEMPRA, MIRANT, NEW ENERGY=
,=20
CONECTIV, and AEP.  These will be sent out Monday with a note reminding them=
=20
about the balance of the day.  Overall, I received great responses.  Good=20
Luck with the new product!!!  Let me know if I can do anything else.
