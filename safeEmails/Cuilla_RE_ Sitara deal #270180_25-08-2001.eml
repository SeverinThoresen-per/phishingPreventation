Martin,
	This Sitara deal #270180 ends in June 2001.  However, I received an invoice=
 from KCS for July production at meter #36381.  At Edwards #2-19 they are in=
voicing me for a total of 62 MMBtu, and at Russell #1-20 they are invoicing =
me for 124 MMBtu.  Should this deal have been extended to include July, or i=
s there another deal out there?  These deals do not show up in Unify.  Pleas=
e advise.  Thank you.
