Dear Friends and Colleagues:

I am truly pleased and excited to report that on 1 November I will start my
new job as Director Government Affairs for Enron Corporation in its
Portland, Oregon Office. I will be supporting Enron North America's Western
power trading desk, which is located there.  Among other people, I will be
working with Tim Belden and Paul Kaufman.   I will be commuting between
there and my home in California until I can move the family up sometime
during Q1 2001.  My new contact information is as follows:

G. Alan Comnes
Director, Government Affairs
Enron Corporation
World Trade Center
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC0306
Portland OR 97204
503-464-8129
mobile/pager phone: 510-367-5741 (for the time being)
AComnes@prodigy.net (for the time being)

Please keep in touch and, if you are in Portland, give me a holler!

Cheers,

Alan Comnes
