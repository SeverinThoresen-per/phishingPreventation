Dave Forster and I were talking last week concerning the broker agreements=20
and Dave had a good suggestion.  If we included language in the commercial=20
agreement that makes the broker aknowledge that by clicking on the GTC they=20
are agreeing that the contract is similar to the terms and conditions we=20
contemplate with the counterparty and that the damages indicated in the GTC=20
would prevail in the event of a broken trade.  This will allow us to use the=
=20
current GTC click structure, the GTC liquidated damages and any other terms=20
in the GTC we wanted to retain yet not bind them under the other terms of th=
e=20
GTC. =20
