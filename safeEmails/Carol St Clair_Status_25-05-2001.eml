As I mentioned in my voice mail to you, we have accepted the CSP language=20
with the October 2002 date and with my other modifications which Susan sent=20
to you yesterday.  With respect to the Guaranty, the last draft that I saw=20
had a termination date of June 30, 2001.  Just want to make sure taht=20
whatever is signed has a different termination date (i.e. June 30, 2002). =20
Again, before we release our Guaranty I would like to see the final version=20
of your Guaranty.  Thanks.=20
