I have a few bottles of Archery Summit...I've always wanted to try the Beaux=
 Freres (which by the way is French for brother in law..RP's=20
being the man who runs it)

Yes, please forward to Sara.  Of course, if you can afford it, the almost-un=
iversally acclaimed best Oregon Pinot comes from either Beaux Freres (Parker=
 is a part owner) or Archery Summit (Phil Andrus' new, gravity-fed, undergro=
und winery with a European architectural flair, which is unusual in Oregon w=
ineries).  Those are about $60-$80 for their best single-vineyard stuff.

This is good info...do you mind if I forward it on to Sara Shackleton, who i=
s an even bigger Pinot fan than me?  Come visit and we'll drink a bottle of =
Merry Edwards, which is a Russian River Valley winery and which makes my fav=
orite Pinot (although I love the  Ken Wrights a lot)

PS Those prices sound a little better than we do here not to menton the avai=
lability problem

My neighbor here is a faithful Ken Wright customer; during the holidays he w=
as invited to a small-scale, cozy affair in Ken's winery, and since my frien=
d's wife didn't want to go, he took me.  We bought several bottles each of t=
he 2001 Pinots; I think our price was $33 per bottle (and $66 for a magnum, =
but the prices were nonlinear and higher for larger bottles).  Besides the y=
ummy snacks, the highlight for me was to taste each of the single vineyard 2=
001 Pinots; in most cases, the grower himself (didn't see any women growers =
there) was there, thiefing out of the casks, which had only just been filled=
=2E  I met Mr. McCrone, whose wines were my favorite, and several other grow=
ers who sell to Wright.

Albertson's here is selling 2000 K. Wrights at $39.99 per bottle, but there =
is a 10% discount if you buy six bottles.  I'm telling you this so that you'=
ll know that we can't do much better here than you did. =20

Have you tried Chehalem's 2000 three-vineyard Pinot?  You might be able to f=
ind it for about $25, and I think it's a great value.

I have been befriended by a commercial grower (he has 17 acres planted betwe=
en Newburg and Dundee), who has had me out several times to pick and prune. =
 Soon I'll help him bottle his 2000 Pinot, which is exquisite, and he's goin=
g to give me some bottles for my trouble.  He's getting his winery licenses,=
 but has recently been selling all his fruit (which is very low yield, less =
than 2 lbs per vine) to Eric Hamacher.  Check out Hamacher in Parker's repor=
t on the 2000 Oregon Pinots, and you will see that Parker believes young Eri=
c (I met him at my friend's vineyard) might become the best maker of Pinot o=
n Earth (those aren't my words, they're Parker's, or at least his assistant'=
s).  Hamacher wines are hard to find here (low production), but since he's y=
oung, they are only about $35.  A real bargain from a rising star.  Same for=
 Patty Green, who used to be the maker for Torii Mor, although I don't know =
much about her; her wines are supposed to be outstanding and still not too e=
xpensive.

In my own yard, I have a mini-vineyard of 25 plants, mostly grafted Dijon cl=
ones (115 and 777 on 101-14 rootstock, and own-rooted Pommard).

Hope all is well with you, Dan.  Take care,

Kenton
