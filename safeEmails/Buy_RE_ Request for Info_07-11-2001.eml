I work in Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) and one of our tasks is to prepa=
re quarterly information that is presented to the Enron Board of Directors. =
 The Board has requested background information on the employees of RAC such=
 as education, certifications, etc. plus a picture.  I would like to know if=
 there is a way I could work with you to get this information out of Expertf=
inder instead of having to manually look up and record data for close to 75 =
employees.  The most helpful thing for me would be if you could query your d=
ata to pull RAC employees and then send me a data file containing all the in=
formation (education, certifications, picture if possible, etc.). =20

As far as I know, this is a one time request and it is not due until the nex=
t Board meeting which is the beginning of December.  However, we would like =
to get started on this as soon as possible since this is a request in additi=
on to the usual items we present to the Board each quarter.

Please let me know if you can help us in this process.  Feel free to call me=
 to discuss.
