Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreci=
ate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
 =20

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each part=
icipant in relation to its bond rating as follows:=20
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation t=
o which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator. =
  I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels a=
s that will determine the action required. =20

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading =
limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of f=
inancial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, le=
tter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a=
 Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending insti=
tution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool admi=
nistrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the=
 trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relat=
ive standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception =
to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and theref=
ore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants=
 are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rat=
ing within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of defau=
lt for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial positi=
on within 2 business days of said default or change.=20
