Gerald,

Can I get a standard CA put together for the following company:

Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P.
500 Dallas
Suite 1100
Houston, TX  77002

The topic would be related to "certain compression assets in the SACROC Unit=
 in Scurry County, TX."  I would like to get something to them ASAP, but no =
later than Monday as we are trying to meet with them on Friday morning next =
week.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Chris
