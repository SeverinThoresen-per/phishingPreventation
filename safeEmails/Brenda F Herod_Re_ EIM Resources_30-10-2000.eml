I have just returned to the office, and am making it through my E-mails=20
gradually.  It seems that Clickpaper.com is the concern of this memo.  I am=20
not up to speed on this European effort.  I suggest this:  I would suggest a=
=20
conference call to discuss.  I would also like for Clickpapaer to be there,=20
so if you provide me a name of your Clickpapaer contact, I'll make sure they=
=20
are included.  Also please provide an assistant's name, and I'll have Yvette=
=20
schedule the call.

In the meantime, I'll talk with the Clickpaper people here to get up to spee=
d=20
on their plans.

Thanks for the E-mail. =20

At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like t=
o=20
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they stil=
l=20
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so=20
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a coupl=
e=20
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime,=
=20
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details=
=20
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only=20
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements throug=
h=20
ECTRIC).

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM.=20
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both=20
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of=20
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to=20
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road=20
until Brenda returns.  Let me know.=20

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to=20
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.  =
=20
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so=20
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We=20
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry. =

Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you=

have heard anything on this. =20
