Sarah:
What a mess this is.  I need your advice on what I should do.  I was told=20
that the only way that I can play on the Rice team is to either play with a=20
3.5 man or not to play on my Tuesday night league.  Bill tells me that there=
=20
are no 3.5 men available to add to our roster.  Is that true?  This is reall=
y=20
a difficult choice for me because I really enjoy playing on the Tuesday nigh=
t=20
team and i still feel that we have a chance to advance further.  What do you=
=20
think I should do?

Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days!  This is=20
the part of tennis that I really don't like.  I've had numerous email=20
conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist. =
=20
Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.  One=
=20
of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation,=20
and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would=20
have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.  This=20
evidently happened to her team two years ago.  (I think she's rationalizing=20
after-the-fact.)

You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie=20
Hollis.  She's my women's team captain.  I've called her on the carpet about=
=20
this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is=20
hurting me, too.  She did try to withdraw her "protest," but Cheryl had=20
evidently already taken action.  There are so many people out there that are=
=20
mis-ranked.  The fellow playing with Kelly last Sunday should not be a=20
3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd shoul=
d=20
not be a 4.5...and on and on.  I have heard through Roger White--Rice U's=20
womens coach and a USTA verifier--that they are slowly trying to rectify=20
mis-rankings by looking more closely at league and tournament results.  I=20
think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.

Bill Hunt has all sorts of counter-arguments.  He had Cheryl's approval to=20
play you in mixed at 4.0.  Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker=20
4.0 men--who are borderline 3.5 material--they'd let it pass.  Who knows.  I=
f=20
we are going to lose you--and Chris after this week--we're going to be prett=
y=20
weak, not to mention demoralized.

After all, we're all just trying to have some fun on the tennis court. =20
Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to=20
North Carolina.  We're out at Lee LeClear.  I don't remember if you or Bill=20
are scheduled to play, but please join us for a little send-off celebration=20
after the match if you can.
