Fred- Robyn structured and executed our first power deal with AIG's Arbitrag=
e Fund yesterday- DKR.

Its our first deal.. we made money and it fit directionally into Steve Vu's =
book.

We have been pitching the weather product since the beginning of the year bu=
t have been limited by the size of transactions we could do and the funds un=
derstanding of the market.  Most of the funds want to use weather as a hedge=
 for an underlying position in gas or power.. and the size of the market in =
weather has not been enough to cover directional NYMEX views.

So we started to look at smaller deals in the market areas to hedge regional=
 power and gas underlyings that will naturally be smaller positions.

DEAL we did: Basket of 5 cities... equally weighted


DKR sold Nov HDD swap of basket of 5 cities: chicago, clevland, LGA, DC, Bos=
ton - equally weighted average of the 5 cities
strike =3D 650
payout=3D 2,000/HDD  with 400,000 cap.

DKR benefits if it is warm.
