Vince,

I left you a voice message that explains a little about the history of this=20
inquiry (you may want to refer to that first).

Please let me know what you know about this and your opinion.

Thank you,

Anthony,
Please contact Vince Kaminsky at ext. 3-3848.  I think his group has this=20

=20
me know if this works for you.

Hi, Gracie.

I'm just following up on my inquiry from last week.  Have you begun any=20
discussions on Statistics classes?

Anthony

Gracie,

Does Enron have any statistics classes?  Ones more focused on basic=20
statistics and the lingo (ex: alpha, beta, delta-gamma, Type I & II error,=20
distributions, kurtosis, etc.) than the VaR class?

I have not seen any in the class schedule.  In working with traders and=20
studying Risk Mangement concepts, even our "experts" that know almost=20
everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem=
=20
to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics!!!  This lack of=20
knowledge basically makes my job as a Fundamentals Analyst (researching the=20
underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing EGM/EA/EIM=20
profits) very inefficient.

If they already do not exist, I recommend that ERNIE institute two types of=20
statistics classes (which mirror the existing Finance class selection). =20
"Introduction to Statistics" (perhaps a database approach - including=20
application to Excel?) and "Applied Statistics" (which would be a more=20
advanced approach that specifies how Enron uses - or should use - statistics=
=20
in risk management marketing).

Please let me know what you think.

Cordially,

Anthony Sexton
