Bob,
Here are the details for the fills.  We actually cleaned out the database
just prior to 3:00 PM CST yesterday in preperation for the testing.  If you
could reconcile based ont he first deal datetime and count from their
forward that would be great.

Here are the details.

user		Fills
----------------	----------
arizona		12
avista		3
adams		17
bptrader		57
Total		89

First fill datetime stamp to start counting from : 5-22-2001 14:58:31.440
CST.

If you could count forward from that point we should be in sync.

Thanks,  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday to go over the latest version of
the application.  Flight back was a bit long - got into Boston at 1 AM and
didn't get home til 2:30 AM...
