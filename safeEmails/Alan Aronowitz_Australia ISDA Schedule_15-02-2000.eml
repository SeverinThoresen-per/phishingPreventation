David Minns has recently sent to me a proposal to revise the ISDA Schedule=20
being currently used in Australia ("Proposal").

Today, I am going to forward the Proposal (which includes a redline against=20
the current version, a memo from David justifying the changes, and a note=20
from our outside counsel) to the two of you, our in-house experts, under a=20
copy of this e-mail. I believe I'm in agreement with the changes posed by=20
David. Please advise me and David if you have any issues with the=20
modifications he is proposing. Mallesons our law firm in Sydney, has reviewe=
d=20
the changes and approved of them.

If we do not hear back within a week, we will assume that the changes are=20
acceptable from your standpoint and begin using the form in its revised stat=
e.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Alan
