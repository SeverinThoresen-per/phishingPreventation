In response to some considerable concern voiced by Presto, we are re-evaluat=
ing our Broker Client relationships.  I'm planning to send the following ema=
il to each of the desk heads.  It is intended primarily to generate feedback=
 from the desks, but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and =
essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions inste=
ad of EOL.  Before I launched it, I wanted to get your thoughts.

Thanks,
Brad



Earlier this year, Enron executed deals with certain Broker's which allows t=
he broker to execute transactions for their clients via a Broker Client whic=
h is linked to the EnronOnline platform.  All executions done on Broker Clie=
nt are free of brokerage charges.  To date, about 80% of the 3,400 broker tr=
ades executed on-line have been in the US Power segment.  The companies that=
 have access to read and execute transactions using the Broker Client are as=
 follows:

APB Energy, Inc. (Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Nat Gas, US Power, US=
 Coal, US Emissions, US Weather, US Crude, US Bandwidth)
Natsource LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, US Coal, US Emissions=
)
Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. (Asian Crude, Bandwidth, US Crude, US Nat Gas, Be=
lgian Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, European Crude)
Amerex Power, Ltd. (Australian Power, Austrian Power, Bandwidth, Canadian Po=
wer, Dutch Power, German Power, Nordic Power, Spanish Power, Swiss Power, UK=
 Power, US Power)
Power Merchants Group, LLC (US Financial Nat Gas)
Prebon Energy, Inc. (US Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Power,=
 US Coal, US Emissions, US Crude)
Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Ltd (UK Gas, UK Power, Continental Power, Contin=
ental Gas, European Crude, European Weather, Asian Weather, Asian Crude, Eur=
opean Bandwidth)
Natsource Tullett Europe Limited (UK Nat Gas, UK Power, Continental Gas, Con=
tinental Power, European Coal)
GFI EnergyNet LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Gas, Canadian Power)
TFS Energy, LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US =
Bandwidth)

A significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted=
 to a free option on the part of the brokers, who will transact with Enron o=
n long-dated product only if they can't find an equal or better price from a=
 supplier who will pay brokerage.  While I am confident that this possibilit=
y was discussed when the deals were struck, the current situation calls for =
some changes.  Accordingly, our plan would be to exercise our right to shut =
down all Broker Clients immediately.  As a result, we would be forced to ret=
urn approximately $1.2 MM in fees paid by the brokers listed above.

Let me be clear that this does not preclude future Broker Client arrangement=
s.  The decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity-by-=
commodity and region-by-region basis.  In other words, we can grant access t=
o whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with.  If particular de=
sks have broker relationships that they would like to move on-line in suppor=
t of their market, the technology and resources are available to make this h=
appen.  What we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the Broker Client=
 product so that we are not employing a "one-size-fits-all" solution.

I would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before w=
e decide to proceed.

Thanks,
Brad Richter
