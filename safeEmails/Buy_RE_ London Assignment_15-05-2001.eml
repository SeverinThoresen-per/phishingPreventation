Rick,
Amongst my concerns are:
	The budget calls for 54 heads to do the job in EEL-RAC. There are currently=
 31 with 3 offers on the table on 5/14.
	There was absolutely no on going recruiting effort here, therefore I have t=
o start from scratch.
	The heads that are here are junior at best with little or no Enron or manag=
ement experience.
	There is such a dearth of senior people here that there are almost no peopl=
e to screen resumes or interview candidates
	There is no understanding of the role of RAC in Enron Europe.
[Buy, Rick] =20
Agree, you are supposed to fix all of the above!
	The IT platform and operational problems put the risk management activities=
 of our group back 3 years at least.
[Buy, Rick]  Agree this is an issue.=20
	The Houston based RAC group (primarily credit) is provincial, uncooperative=
 and boring.
[Buy, Rick]  At least they are in their seats working. Maybe you should send=
 Rod back since he is a part of the Houston bore core. You have failed to bu=
ild consensus in your credit initiative. Without buy-in it is almost impossi=
ble to implement change at Enron
	In addition to losing net 9 bodies here, the Market Risk group in Houston l=
ost 4 and is poised to lose several more because of =20
		disappointment  with the opportunity set within RAC.
[Buy, Rick]  I find it curious that our primary problem with turnover is in =
Houston Market Risk and London. Linkage?? If people aren't satisfied for the=
 right reasons, they should leave. There is all kind of opportunity in RAC. =
People are going all over the world and doing different things. We have peop=
le in Portland, Sydney, Calgary, London. People have left the group and done=
 well as well. We offer lifetime career satisfaction guarantees to no one.=20
	We are uncompetitive with respect to all-in compensation, title, and resour=
ces to do the job as evidenced by an inability to recruit good talent.
[Buy, Rick]  Disagree. We did an extensive study last year and adjusted ever=
yone that needed adjustment. It is difficult to recruit. It is one of the ha=
rdest things to do in management. It requires salesmanship, good timing and =
closing ability, especially when a group is in turmoil.
	I can rebuild this group but it is going to take longer than anyone thought=
 because of poor previous management.
	Finally, I am trouble finding my own motivation.  I believe that I continue=
 to do a good job for the firm yet I do not feel that I am recognized for th=
e effort.
[Buy, Rick]  Memos, and other ill thought out outbursts like this are precis=
ely why you are not recognized.
	This painful rebuilding process does nothing to make me smarter, more valua=
ble or more interesting excep through a fairly monumental physical 			and em=
otional effort on my part.=09
[Buy, Rick]  I would look at it as an opportunity to turn around a segment o=
f the company that needs help which is precisely why you were sent to London=
=2E I don't particularly care what it does for Ted Murphy.

In  summary here, unless you had just a really bad day, you oght to consider=
 an alternative assignment either in Enron or outside. You were sent to Lond=
on to fix a problem the organization has. You are lucky in that there is agr=
eement that there is a problem and resources are available ($) to fix them. =
This is not unlike Joe Gold taking over metals, or Delaney taking over EES. =
Big mess, needs fixing. People that do this are usually recognized.

[Buy, Rick]  You may want to discuss this tomorrow.   I'm fairly open.=20
 Rick
I am interested in your commments
Ted

I will think about it. We are achieving the correct outcome here but the tim=
ing is off. Concentrate on Caulfield and Oman. Get Brown involved to make su=
re we get those guys. Use Ene options as a currency to entice them. Upside m=
uch better than Chase/JP. Just a thought. Rick

Rick
I am obviously at pretty close to an all-time low in my most recent career  =
at Enron. I need to talk to you about where this is going. I would appreciat=
e it if you would think about this over the weekend and I will schedule some=
 time to discuss with you next week.
Ted
