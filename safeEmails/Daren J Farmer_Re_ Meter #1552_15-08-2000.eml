Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.

 We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take=
=20
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes eac=
h=20
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, w=
e=20
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within=20
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual=20
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.
