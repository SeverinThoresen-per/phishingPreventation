As we are nearing the deadline for the Book-split project, I want to give yo=
u=20
a status update.

BOOK-SPLIT

Completed
Separate Cash & Term books have been setup in Enpower and Global databases=20
for every country
Pablo Pissanetzky has written code to successfully transfer over 99% of the=20
deals into their proper regional books
Two dozen deals (mainly annuities) have been modified in Production to=20
transfer according to Pablo's code
All deals requiring manual intervention on Go Live date have been identified
Initial position report has been developed and tested for accuracy

Uncompleted
Communication to Commercial of positions (Wed. April 26)
Presentation of the Position Report which allows Commercial to view monthly=20
peak/off-peak volumes by region (Wed. April 26)
PCS by deal for each portfolio
Separate DPRs and associated reports for the Pool and Bilateral portfolios
Modifications necessary for the Settlements invoicing system


TRANSMISSION

We are making progress on this effort although you have not seen any hard=20
evidence.  Zhiyong Wei is the IT Director in Houston who is responsible for=20
Enpower development.  We are working with Pablo and Zhiyong on several=20
possibilities.  As we have previously discussed, there is not the current=20
capability to value the spreads as options, but we are testing the other=20
scenarios.=20

Buy/Resale
This deal type has been disabled
We are waiting for Zhiyong's response as to its future functionality if any

Transmission
Pablo tested in the Stage environment today after receiving minor assistance=
=20
from Zhiyong
Ability to book Transmission deal without Annuity leg
Ability to liquidate demand charge daily
Reflects long and short positions at the appropriate regions (as Forwards no=
t=20
Options)
Does not value the forward spread between the regional curves (still testing=
)
Variable cost treatment is still being tested

Forwards
If deep in the money, we could enter intra-desk/inter-desk deals to reflect=20
positions and P&L=20

Much time and IT development resources have been spent to make use of the=20
Transmission functionality.  After speaking with Zhiyong, there evidently wa=
s=20
a big push last year for the MTM of Transmission.  The latest version has=20
been in the test environment for some time, but no one is currently testing=20
it.  It will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complet=
e=20
by the book-split deadline.

As we established in our last meeting, the MTM of transmission is a separate=
=20
project from the book-split.  Due to the complexity and amount of data=20
involved in the book-split project itself, it is advisable that we=20
incorporate the transmission second.  Further testing of the transmission=20
will continue this week and by the end of the week we should have a decision=
=20
on the most effective way to currently book transmission. =20

Please call or come by if you have any questions,
Todd Hall
