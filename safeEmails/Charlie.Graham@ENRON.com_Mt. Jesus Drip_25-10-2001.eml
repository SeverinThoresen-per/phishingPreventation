I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for =
delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had be=
en withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only i=
ncluded the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested=
 in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amou=
nts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on t=
rack.
