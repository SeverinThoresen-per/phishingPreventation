Randy,

I have spoken with several contacts at OneOk in the recent past. Just this m=
orning I talked with a Jerry Knight who works together with Delaine Kurth an=
d he is supposed to let me know how the billing, etc. is being handled by WE=
GO.
Last week Lynn Blair talked with Delaine to see what could be done with the =
situation of WEGO hauling the so-called water (water is being marked as the =
substance being hauled on the run tickets, but we have done analysis from tw=
o lacations and have found it primarily condensate) from the locations at th=
e Sublette Plant and the Morton Co. #1 dehys. If OneOk is not receiving the =
revenue from this condensate, then in turn ETS does not receive the BTU repl=
acements for the gas for UAF purposes as our contract states.
We have resolved the issue that was occuring in the same fashion at the Mt. =
Jesus station and are now being reimbursed by OneOk for this location's BTU =
replacements. I do not know if they changed trucking services or what, but i=
t has been taken care of.
As far as setting up a face to face meeting with OneOk, that will be determi=
ned from OneOk's response to their findings through WEGO and their practices=
 in hauling from these two points.
I will keep you updated as I am informed.

RB

I am presently working with Ronnie Brickman regarding resolving this issue. =
Ronnie has been in contact with Oneok and is attempting to set up a face to =
face meeting with them. I have asked the Admin. Team to provide me all WEGO =
bills which have occured in 2001.  I will keep you posted as to the stauts o=

FYI Randy Howard is looking into this as well as other liquids issues in the=
 Region.

Thanks for the alert and I am sure Randy will be asking for your help.

It has come to light, by way of a Wego driver, that Enron has been billed fo=
r the liquids that were produced from Oneok facilities.  After further discu=
ssion it was discovered that the Hugoton plant as well as some field locatio=
ns in the Liberal Region are also being billed to Enron instead of Oneok.  T=
his problem may need to be investigated further and a plan to correct this i=
mplemented.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Respectfully,
