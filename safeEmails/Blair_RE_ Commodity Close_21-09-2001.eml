	Debra, thanks for your reply.  Are you comfortable now that you can perform=
 this function instead
	of Raetta if Jean is gone?  Does Jean need to have more specific instructio=
ns to cover Transok that
	specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?  Thanks. Ly=

I had reviewed with Jean the procedures for allocating the volumes using the=
 required spreadsheet from Transok.  However, I did not have procedure for t=
he allocation of
estimated volumes.  Upon requesting the spreadsheet from Transok for the cur=
rent month, I learned that the spreadsheet would not be available until afte=
r our close.  At
this point, I  found that I was in need of Raetta's help to put in estimates=
=2E  To date, I have  received the current month spreadsheet from Transok wh=
ich will require
PPAs,

	Debra, I understand you were covering for Jean Adams while she was on vacat=
ion.
	Did we have the proper coverage to get CMS allocated volumes in GVA reviewe=
d
	as we needed.  Just wanted to follow up.  I would be glad to visit with you=
 about
	this if we need.

	Thanks. Lynn
