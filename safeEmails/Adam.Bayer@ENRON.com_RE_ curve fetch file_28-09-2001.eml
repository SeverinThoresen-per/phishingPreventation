John,

I have added the curves to a curve fetch file in O:\ERMS\Excel Queries\JMcKa=
yCurveFetch.xls
I did not know which curves to get rid of, but if you go through it just hid=
e the ones that you don't want, you won't have to go back and add them later=
=2E  I have access to the folder and file, but I don't have rights to run th=
e macro.  I have tacked the curves you requested to the last four columns of=
 each sheet (one sheet for dailies and the other sheet for basis curves).  C=
all with any questions.

Adam

Adam,

The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank Yo=
u.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a f=
ew other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chi=
cago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves,=
 I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.

If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jon
