Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding =
the downfall of ENE. =20
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation k=
nowing your terrible performance?=20
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change o=
f control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the diction=
ary is "To put to rest"=20
