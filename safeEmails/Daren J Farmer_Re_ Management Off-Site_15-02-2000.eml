I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective=20
training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.  For example, we are=20
giving an HPL training session today.  We should not have to give another=20
full blown session in the future.  The group should be able to take this=20
knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.  With the=
=20
rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some=20
knowledge has been lost.
