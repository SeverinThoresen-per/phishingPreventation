Major budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act t=
ogether for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - Anthony Dayao, Beth =
Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through. =20
=20
Finalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.  Can give you the deta=
ils on why later today.  Will become obvious.=20
=20
Just meet with Shankman and McConnell.  Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet=
=2E  They say that their commercial guys are waiting for Jeff Johnson to get=
 with them on details of IT development projects.  I think that Jeff has bee=
n out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down the=
re with Shankman and McConnell.  I will leave him a voice mail message to ge=
t an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.  Jeff and Mike wan=
t to have their stuff finalized by Friday.  I will convey that timeline to J=
eff Johnson.=20
=20
After EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is=
 expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.  Hig=
h priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be o=
bvious.  I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads toget=
her this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be requir=
ed to help us extract necessary info. =20
=20
Nice way of telling you, Greg, that I understand your desire for a page of f=
ootnotes with budget explanations for Whalley, and that in my opinion that f=
alls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today.  I will=
 work with Kerry on this.  I can tell you, however, that updates on budgets =
are not top on anyone's lists today, including Whalley's.  We will honor you=
r commitment to get him updated information, and will provide as much detail=
 as possible.  Best approach given the state of business today may be to pro=
vide him with the high level overview (that one page of expense and capital)=
, state where we are in the review process with each business unit, and high=
light reductions in expense and capital to date.   We can continue to provid=
e updates to Whalley as the EES, EIM, EGM and EBS (yes, I need to coordinate=
 with Mark P. when he is back on some changes here - confidential at this po=
int).  Don't know how useful detailed footnotes will be for Whalley before w=
e truly finalize the various business unit budgets.  --Sally=20

Some things that jump out at me on the Whalley packet page labelled Global S=
upport Dollars - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast Variance dated 10/23/01
=20
Under EGM, increase of 5,573 in operations expense and increase of 16,159 in=
 IT development expense.  Doesnt that sound like a big jump?
=20
What made EIMs infrastructure go up 2,334?
=20
How is energy operations for EES down 9,092?
=20
What did EES spend capital on in 2001 to make the capital IT infrastructure =
variance be down 19,726?
=20
What is going on at Corp. with a positive IT infrastructure variance of 13,9=
24?
=20
On the front page or Whalley summary page, why did depreciation go from 62,0=
28 to 30,124 to 57,843.  I know some of what you said Kerry but we need to m=
ake sure that Enron knew the 2001 depreciation number in the 2001 plan and t=
hat 62,028 did get depreciated accurately and that it just so happened to tu=
rn out that only 30,124 got done on our books.
=20
You get the point.  I think this is what Whalley will do too with the entire=
 packet on all pages.  I know the numbers are right, they just beg alot of q=
uestions so make sure we have an updated, very accurate cheat sheet with all=
 the explanations so when he gets the packet today, he can follow it!
=20
I assume everything ties that should.

Thanks.
