Hasan,

The new Service Requestor Report does not have operator information and the =
Scheduled Quantity Report does have the operator option.  We need to discuss=
 this further before making a decision to turn the old reports off.

All,
some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity report=
s in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  S=
ince the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones,=
 the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not h=
appened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of=
 reports that are used for same information.

At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old repor=
ts as part of changes implemented on 10/13.

Thanks
