I have modified the path for the EES sheet once again.  We need to make a ne=
w=20
sheet and email it to Neil Bresnan at EES for each day.  Please use the=20
format developed for the 24th and 26th in the folder.  EES is confused by=20
seeing both buy and sell prices.  I would also prefer that we do not disclos=
e=20
who we bought or sold to.

The sheets should now be in P/Realtime/EES/Feb 01/02_26

Thanks,
Bill

The EES summary sheet is now in P/Realtime/EES/EES FEB.  Just copy the EES=20
deals over from the Inc. Sheet. Do not copy any colums past the Sell Price=20
colum as it is not necessary for EES to have all our Info.=20
