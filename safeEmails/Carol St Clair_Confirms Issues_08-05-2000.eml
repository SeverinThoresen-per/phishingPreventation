Sara:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all tha=
t=20
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all=20
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have=20
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding=20
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues=
=20
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard=20
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as t=
o=20
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties. =20
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching =
a=20
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree=20
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

Carol
