Because of the issue Andrea raises in the email below I think it would be a=20
good idea for you to meet with Mike.  I also think Andrea should participate=
=20
by phone since she is most familiar with the CNV and other legal issues that=
=20
will impact EOL trading in Argentina.

To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I fully understand the purpose of their=20
trip.  Mike seems to want to be able to carry out financial transactions on=20
shore (through and Enron Argentine vehicle and with Argentine CPs) through=20
EOL.  Although there are probably other issues on their agenda, I'm sure the=
y=20
will want to meet with Lynn to specifically discuss this matter.  I am=20

amend the bankruptcy law.  I will give you an update just in case you decide=

to join them for the meeting. =20

Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from=20
Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage -=20
actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that=20
would be fine with me.
