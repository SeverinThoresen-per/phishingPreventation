Subject: PSNC PROBLEM ON MARCH 1ST

Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day o=
n
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC=20
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC t=
o
contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth=
=20
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler an=
d
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth pe=
r
day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what shoul=
d
and did get scheduled?  Thank you.
