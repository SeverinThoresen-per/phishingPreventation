I have spoken with Calger about us going through the West Power contracts wi=
th his team next Tuesday through Friday.  They are gathering an extended set=
 of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 =
exposures.  The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agre=
ements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26=
th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th expo=
sure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had compl=
eted to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also g=
oing to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can be=
gin to get educated on the current effort.

Lorraine Becker (ext. 31680) will be handling travel arrangements.  Please f=
orward your credit card # so she can complete the reservations. =20
(P.S. Piper is getting verification from Bowen regarding travel expenditures=
