John and I discussed a couple of Bushton Measurement issues today that I wou=
ld like you to take a lead on.

* According to John, the difference between their PTR and our meters seems t=
o be abnormal for April and May of this year.  He will designate a ONEOK exp=
ert to call Ken Cessac to discuss possible investigations to resolve, if pos=
sible.  I would include an examination of the Plant PTR process and not just=
 a limitation to Ultrasonic Meter Issues.


* John has expressed a concern for the need to add further clarification to =
the Measurement Agreement.  He foresees some issues that may not be addresse=
d in the agreement.  I told him that I thought it would be better to resolve=
 these issues before they became a problem and agreed to listen to their con=
cerns and work to resolve if possible.
