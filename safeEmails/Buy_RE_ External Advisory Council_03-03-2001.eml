Subject:	External Advisory Council

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting, one=
 activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council. =
 This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and socia=
l issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other business=
es, to advise us on trends and issues in this area.  An outline of the advis=
ory council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names i=
s attached below.

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the Enr=
on executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate Resp=
onsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.  We plan to present a slate =
of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, and wo=
uld appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.

Thanks for your consideration.
