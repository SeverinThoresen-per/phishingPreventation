Mr. Davis:
Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me=
=20
when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that=20
we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section tha=
t=20
if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for al=
l=20
of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were=
=20
entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are=20
incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination=20
language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly=20
reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the=20
Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or afte=
r=20
the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.
