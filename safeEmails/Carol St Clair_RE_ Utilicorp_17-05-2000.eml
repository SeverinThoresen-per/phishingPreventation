Carol, I wasn't able to open the images you attached to your email, but both
the ISDA and the Transfer and Termination Agreement are dated May 3, 2000.
The only possible concern would be those transactions that we are entering
into between May 3 and the day that the UtiliCorp ISDA is executed, at which
time we will actually enter into trades as UtiliCorp.  However, I believe
that we have worded the Transfer and Termination Agreement in such a manner
that, once such document is executed, all trades done as ARM will fall under
the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed
within the week.  Feel free to let me know if you you have further
questions/concerns.
