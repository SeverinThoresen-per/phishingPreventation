Group,

When entering a physical annuity (for example, for the sale of ST-Cali lengt=
h=20
in SP-15), we need to make that the annuity starts and ends for 2 days from=20
now, for 1 mw, for HE 1, for the appropriate dollar amount.  So today is the=
=20
22nd, consequently I would make any annuity for deals done today, start and=20
stop on the 24th, for HE 1.  I would like to observe this 2 day difference o=
n=20
every annuity that we make.  So, if you need an annuity for an amount on the=
=20
23rd, make the annuity for the 25th.  Please be sure that the start and stop=
=20
times for the deal and for the strip match.  An annuity will not flag  an=20
error in a mismatch between the strip and the information on top like a=20
forward deal. =20

We are currently having many problems settling annuitys.  Extra comments in=20
the comment sections can only help.  PLEASE ask questions of senior team=20
members or myself, and get this right!

Thank you,
Bill
