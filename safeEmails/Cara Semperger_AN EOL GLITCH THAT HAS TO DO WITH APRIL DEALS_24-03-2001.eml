I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time=20
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is=20
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something=20
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we se=
e=20
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of=20
these deals are fixed.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when=20
they should be PDT.=20
=20
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time=20
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already settin=
g=20
up for April.

I am particularly worried about how these are corrected because they are lon=
g=20
term transmission deals that cannot be autoscheduled.
