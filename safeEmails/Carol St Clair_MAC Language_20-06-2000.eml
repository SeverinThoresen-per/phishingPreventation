Mike:
I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves, our credit person,=
=20
and we are okay with the concept except that we would like for the ratings=20
trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to=20
have an S&P rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in=
=20
place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral=20
threshold:

BB to BB+  $2,500,000
Below BB  Zero

I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our form of Credit=20
Support Annex?
