This is Travis, Don Baughman's brother, and I want to be the first to invite=
 everyone on a 4day getaway for Don's bachelor party to Cozumel. I am trying=
 to get the ball rolling early on this and have already spoken to many of yo=
u. Basically here's the deal, so get your calenders ready!!! His wedding is =
on September 22, 2001 so the date we picked for the Bachelor Party is (Thurs=
day) September 6 to Sunday September 9. I realize that not everyone will be =
able to go so I expect that it will be about 12 of us. But come on get of yo=
ur ass you probably need a vacation the more the merrier you know!!!  I am s=
till trying to find the cheapest prices and b/c it is over two months away t=
here are no specials yet but I did find one ok price of $450 a piece, that i=
s air and hotel with Continental and staying at the Fiesta Americana in Cozu=
mel. Please let me know asap how many of you can go, yes even those that hav=
e previously confirmed the dates verbally with me. I want to try to! get the=
 prices down a bit, like around $400 but we'll see. If any one knows a trave=
l agent or has some insite on Cozumel let me know. I know most of you and th=
ink it would be best if we can pick our own places to eat. I think the gener=
al plan is to drink and have a great time. I would like to scuba one morning=
 but also think it would be cool to rent some jeeps and drive around the isl=
and, and of course find some questionable local bars. We have most of Thursd=
ay, all day Friday and Saturday and will return Sunday (leaving about 12:00)=
=2E Again please let me know asap (by Tuesday if possible) and I will write =
everyone back next week with better prices I hope.=20

Don on September 14th. At our Parents farm in Iowa Colony (South of Houston)=
=2E It is going to be a casino night so bring some dinero it will start at 7=
:00pm and last till......well whenever. There is plent of room here for thos=
e that may over indulge and need to stay the night. Probably will try get ar=
ound 40-50 people for this event. So far the games are Black Jack and Craps.=
