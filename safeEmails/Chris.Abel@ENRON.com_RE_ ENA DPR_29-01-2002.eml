Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7=
,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East a=
nd West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter f=
rom 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l nu=
mbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris
