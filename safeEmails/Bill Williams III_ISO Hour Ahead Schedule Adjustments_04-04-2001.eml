Bill:

Can you make an effort to tell everyone in real time to try to remember to=20
contact the services customers when a schedule adjustment that incs of decs=20
their generation comes from the ISO.  If we tell them what their final=20
schedule is, they can't argue that it was our fault.  Even if we do not=20
notify them, it is currently our position, that it is not our fault, but at =
a=20
minimum, for customer service, we should try to notify them.

Thanks!

Chris
