Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year f=
ollowing the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis fo=
r your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day p=
receding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute ne=
t shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day pri=
or to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares refl=
ected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional share=
s).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can d=
istribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services fr=
om NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to =
audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on t=
he PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan p=
rovision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call wit=
h you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me =
know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It i=
s clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't und=
erstand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how man=
y shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "T=
he value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the cl=
osing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of =
payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stoc=
k."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers o=
n my account.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
