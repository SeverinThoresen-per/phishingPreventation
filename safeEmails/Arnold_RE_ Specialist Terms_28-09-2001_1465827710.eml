John,

We finally heard from Bo.  Looks like we may be getting together soon to dis=
cuss our proposal.  I would like to get back together with you concerning th=
e specialist requirements and incentives when you can.  I've attached my dra=
ft for you to look at.

I also received a call from Mark B. Fisher.  Apparently Mark caught wind tha=
t Bo talked to us.  Mark is excited about the opportunity of the locals gett=
ing access to EnronOnline numbers.  Mark wants to clear the local trades on =
EnronOnline and enymex.

Let me know how you want to proceed. Thanks

Bob
