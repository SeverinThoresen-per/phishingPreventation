I don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of c=
laims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms o=
f our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.

Terrie, Cole; I'm forwarding these to Michelle.  Michelle, my view:  1.  Emp=
loyees who qualify to the 401K class, may exercise their rights without risk=
ing their severance.   The severance waiver is not a universal surrender of =
rights to bring claims.   Regards, Rj.      =20

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, b=
ut don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany=
 scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will tha=
t affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver a=
s part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareho=
lder class action suite against Enron.
