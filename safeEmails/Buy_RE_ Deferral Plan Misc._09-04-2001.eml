Mr. Buy,

Just wanted to get back with you to confirm that the income fund that you ar=
e invested in has earnings applied on a daily basis.  Attached is a transact=
ion summary that reveals that the interest credited between 2/7/01 and 3/31/=
01 totals $6,080.71.

 << File: Buy Transaction Summary.xls >>=20

Interest rate for the 1st QTR was approx. 1.59%.  On a prorata basis the int=
erest recorded appears to be reasonable.  I would be happy to secure additio=
nal information from the recordkeeper concerning daily earnings on your acco=
unt.  Please let me know if this additional information would be meaningful.

Have a great day!

Kim Bolton
