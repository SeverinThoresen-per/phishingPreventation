Good Morning,
We wanted to send out some clarification, minor changes, and to thank you ag=
ain for your participation in the UBS Warburg Energy Pilot Migration, your f=
eedback will greatly assist us in making the transition to the new environme=
nt as effective as possible.=20
Unfortunately we are still awaiting information from our Corporate Legal sta=
ff regarding legally acceptable and appropriate procedures for moving data b=
etween the Estate (i.e. current Enron) data shares and UBS Warburg Energy da=
ta shares.
For this reason you are not authorized to copy any data from your Estate dat=
a shares (your Z:\ drive) following your migration until the formal communic=
ation from Legal has been communicated and a procedure for this has been pro=
vided.=20
Until the formal procedure has been received from Legal and distributed to u=
sers, the O:\Estate\O drive, O:\Estate\M drive, P:\Estate\P drive (Portland =
users) and P:\Estate\I drive (Calgary users) data will not be available to m=
igrated users.  We do expect this policy to be in place some time day or thi=
s weekend, which will alleviate these restrictions.
Please be aware that we may be advised to delete any data present on your ne=
w H:\ drives after the formal notification from Legal has been distributed.
We greatly apologize for the lack of forewarning regarding this information =
and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please contact 3-1411 if any of =
this information is unclear.=20
Thank you for your continued participation in the Migration effort.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich
