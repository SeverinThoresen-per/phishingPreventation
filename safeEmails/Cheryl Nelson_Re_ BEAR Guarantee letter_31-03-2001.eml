Sara, I confirmed with Mike Bruegel  that he will be opening the account for=

us and has understood this since Tom Doukas and I addressed this issue=20
yesterday.  I will edit your lotus notes entry to reflect this correction.

Also, he asked me whether I knew what documents have to accompany the=20
agreement.  I told him yes, since I do this all the time.  I have in my=20
electronic file folder the blank account form and tax form.  If you would=20
like for me to send electronic copes to you if you do not have copies then=20
let me know.

That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not=20
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take=
=20
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement an=
d=20
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom
