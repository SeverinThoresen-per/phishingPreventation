Vince,
Jacob has good background in OR and can start working on
pipeline problems right away, if we need someone.=20

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times
he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would=20
start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit.
(What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.)=20
He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline=20
projects.

I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives
and finance.=20

Best,
Alex
