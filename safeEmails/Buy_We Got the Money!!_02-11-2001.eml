As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1=
 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more=
 from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be as=
sured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the =
balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, bu=
t the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to =
their supervisors about this situation if you feel "angst".

Rick
