Jacques,

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It a=
lso included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to y=
ou? Is the language "Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Sou=
thwest Bank, approves the assignment" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let =
me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies=
=2E

Thank you,

Phillip
