The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the=20
scheduling practices will be.  This is driven by the fact that the RTO=20
efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders.   Th=
e=20
problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to=20
define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have=20
taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices.   In=20
the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3=20
RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).  =20

FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams=20
issues.   At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function=
=20
8 is lowest on their list of priorities.  Several, includig a rep from the=20
West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched,=
=20
will likely need FERC involvement to "force" a compromise or settlement.  =20
The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams=20
problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves t=
o=20
address the seams issues.   Our argument, of course, is that these are the=20
entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams.
=20
So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26=20
scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice,=
=20
or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses,=20
ramp rates).  My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality (=20
for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices=20
that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of=20
congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merel=
y=20
point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at=20
the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO.   The threat to u=
s=20
is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some "lowest commo=
n=20
denominator" approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of=20
another.

If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that wil=
l=20
impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express thos=
e=20
to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West.  Enron is party=
=20
to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to=20
highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams.  I do intend=
=20
to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional=
=20
FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as=20
possible.

Hi Charles,=20

I was going over the NERC meeting minutes and noticed that you were in=20
