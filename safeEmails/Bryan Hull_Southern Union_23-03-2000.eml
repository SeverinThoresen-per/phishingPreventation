I combined the tickets for the Southern Union plants at Port Arthur and=20
Galveston for April forward to accurately reflect the contract.  The new=20
Sitara number is 224490, and the old numbers are: 17832 and109216. This=20
change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our P&L as well as more=20
accurate invoicing. I believe that this change will reduce our monthly=20
variances due to these deals.   If you have any questions or concerns please=

feel free to give me a call
