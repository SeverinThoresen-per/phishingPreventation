are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of=20
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.=

On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please sen=

those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK? =20

You should be getting lots of flowers and gifts because quite a few people=20
have called for your address.  I see your email is working now.  How are=20
things?  Did you talk to your mother-in-law?

It's been extremely quiet over here, but Susan Bailey is going crazy.  They=20
must have given her what she wanted since she's still here.  No other news. =

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time of=
f=20
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her=20
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to=
=20
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I=20
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence=20
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark
