Sarah,

At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  Mary Joyce, in E=
xecutive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment ag=
reements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in f=
rom Mary first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal pers=
pective.  Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to s=
et for someone under a US agreement.

Michelle

I left a message with you earlier but I don't know if you are around today.

As you know, Andrew Makk is to be a seconded employee from the US to London.=
 I understand there is some debate about the restricitive covenant which has=
 been agreed with Andrew will be 6 months in all circumstances.  Could we di=
scuss how we might achieve this result as soon as possible.

Many thanks
