Hey buddy.  I would love to take a tour.  I'm tied up with a family illness=20
for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.

Great Idea though.

wearing yesterday).  He said that he too was an Enron employee but had misse=
d=20
the United Way kick-off event.  He told me he was one of our corporate pilot=
s=20
and we spoke for several minutes since I had someone waiting at Houston=20
Southwest airport to pick me up. =20

I asked if I might arrange with him to get a tour of our corporate hanger an=

airplanes and he said he would be glad to arrange such an event.  I told him=

that several of us pilots at Enron might be interested.  He gave me his card=

and said that he had a trip for Tuesday but to just call him when we were=20
ready and he would arrange to make it happen.  Soooo... If you are intereste=
