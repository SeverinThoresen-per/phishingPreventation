AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited =
our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students m=
ade to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student bod=
y, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $=
1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our childr=
en were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtya=
rd of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every s=
tudent was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper d=
ollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the =
school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to t=
he flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure=
 will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group i=
n the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags=
=2E Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.
Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the gro=
up about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the=
 Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from =
Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' =
contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It=
's a Small World.
