Steve:
It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to=20
the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is=20
bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It=
=20
is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it=20
separately.  Let me know what you think.
