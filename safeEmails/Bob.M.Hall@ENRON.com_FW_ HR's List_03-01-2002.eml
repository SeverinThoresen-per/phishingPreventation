Sarah provided the list to Louise last week - it was a report run by Comp fr=
om SAP.  The following people were on the list and showing as withdrawn.
=20
Deidre McAffrey=20
Larry J Hunter
Larry G Cash
Jon R Lewis
=20
In reviewing the information this morning, Deidre and Larry Hunter are showi=
ng as terminated effective 12/6/01.  It appears that we have the wrong Jon L=
ewis on the NETCO list - it should be Jon P (known as JP) Lewis.  JP is stil=
l showing active and we will have Kari Oquinn update the NETCO list to refle=
ct the right employee.  With regards to Larry G Cash, today he is showing as=
 active - the action must have been reversed last week as when the report wa=
s pulled, he was showing as withdrawn.
=20
Please advise the status of Larry Hunter as he appears to be the only one st=
ill in question.
=20
Kind regards -
Amy

Amy ran list from SAP to figure out who may have left since Dec 4 from NETCO=
 identified names. Lavo asked for it urgently Dec 22ish and it was best we c=
ould do. Subsequently, I've asked HR reps to notify me of any resignations a=
s they happen. Haven't had any news today although Robert tells me 11 resign=
ed from estate today.

Louise:  Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of t=
he list?  We can verify that they are still with the company and that they a=
re still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from =
HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the comm=
unication problem.  --Sally=20
