Subject: CES Supply Management Agreement

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market=20
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our=20
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Belo=
w=20
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on=20
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will=
=20
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" a=
s=20
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct=20
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load=20
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the=20
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being=20
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for=20
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would=20
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In=20
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also=20
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990,=
=20
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for=20
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and=
=20
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the=
=20
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase=20
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All=20
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I=20
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity=
=20
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I=20
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your=
=20
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity=20
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our=20
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want t=
o=20
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for=20
un-utilized capacity.=20

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause. =
=20
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of simila=
r=20
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power=20
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only=20
transactions would not be subject to this clause.   =20

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss=20
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next=20
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your=
=20
help.=20
