I did not realize this, but you have been denied access to the Risk files fo=
r control purposes.  We moved both the financial and the physical index curv=
es to your directory.

Here are the details:

Physical Index Curves:

O:\ECT_Trading\West\Position Manager\GD-West\West - Phy Index1.xls

Financial Index Curves:

O:\ECT_Trading\West\Position Manager\GD-West\GDI - West II.xls

Thanks

Anne

I do not have access to this file.   I requested access to the curves direct=
ory.  Do I need specific access to the file?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike the exact path and name of the Financial Curve File is:

O:\ERMS\1ntra\CURVES\GDI - West II.xls

It would be better for us if you would set the financial index curves in thi=
s file, just like you do the Physical index curves in the other file.  Let m=
e know what you decide.

Thanks
