Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion=
 you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the p=
ast two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harne=
ssing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the=
 former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of compan=
ies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario.=
 I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about=
 my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was r=
ewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get ba=
ck to me with more specifics on my role within Netco and to see if I have th=
e opportunity to get into trading. It came as quite a shock to me when you m=
entioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any c=
ommitment to join him on a retail venture or empowered him to speak on my be=
half!

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding.=
 I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will=
 work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my futur=
e earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and=
 join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this =
office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organizatio=
n.

Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any mi=
scommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland
