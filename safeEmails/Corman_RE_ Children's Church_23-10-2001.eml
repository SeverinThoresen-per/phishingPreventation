ne of our better days.  Oh well!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need t=
o be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will =
bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?

Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed t=
o switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I wi=
ll take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).
