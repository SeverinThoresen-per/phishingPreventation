Julia,

I just thought that I would check back with you regarding Karen
Pettigrew as a candidate for your company.  She is interested in a
full-time position ,but is also open to doing some contract work while
she  looks for a permanenet position.

I also wondered if your area might need any secretaries with
transactional experience.  I do have some highly qualified candidates
right now.
