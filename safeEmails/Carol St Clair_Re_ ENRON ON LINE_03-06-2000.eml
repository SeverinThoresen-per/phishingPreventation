This morning Carol and I discussed the ETA, and I indicated our concern that
sections 2(g) and 4 be amended so TLM can rely on the information on the
Website which we use for our offer. She is going to address this with Mark
Taylor and call us back. I believe it is a matter of finding words to
satisfy both of us.

Please note that our requests in section 2 (b) and (d) will not be included,
as section 3(c) governs.

Enron also advises in section 6(b) the assignment and consent will only
apply to assignments made by TLM not Enron, and our remedy would be to stop
using the website until we were satisfied with their assignee.

Carol and I also discussed the possibility of having a letter agreement with
the Amended ETA attached,(rather than an 'exceptions' letter), which would
be the governing doc once we 'click'.

I believe we are very close to concluding this.

Best regards
Anne
