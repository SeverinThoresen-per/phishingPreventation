I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.  Bob is the d=
irector of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting =
that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had=
 ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can alway=
s count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  He=
re are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team an=
d the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions coul=
d impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all o=
f these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriat=
e.  I could certainly use some help, however. =20

You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to =
put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who c=
ould make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee =
morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be =
announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Ma=
ybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could =
put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their =
business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.=
  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the busi=
ness units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I =
am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply shar=
e what we are doing with others. =20

Your thoughts?  --Sally=20

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting. =20

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as =
the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk=
 about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but ho=
w about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond th=
e "Building Guy". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there.=20

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's =
important to keep that almost "electric" atmosphere that surrounds the compa=
ny. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as s=
trong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone =
they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when=
 the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Ge=
t some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic d=
evices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting=
=2E Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that ha=
ppen might be worth it.=20

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with=
). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed=
=2E We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on th=
e street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and =
grow some more.=20

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to s=
how up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring peopl=
e running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about re=
cent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal=
 and regular.=20

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concern=
s but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.=20
