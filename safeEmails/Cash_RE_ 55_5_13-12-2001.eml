Go ahead and let them stay until vesting.  Please reverse their terminations=

y got the $4500, offset that amount from pay.  Michelle

Kathy,

Would you mind re-running the list of people who are close to age 55 with 5 =
or are close to 5 years for vesting in cash balance plan?

We would like a 30-day cushion.

Would you please provide this data to me and Kalen?

Thanks.

Michelle
