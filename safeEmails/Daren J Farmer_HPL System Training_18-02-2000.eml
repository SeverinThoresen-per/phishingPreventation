Rita and Lisa,=20

Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would=20
work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early=20
afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate th=
e=20
HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help=20
with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas=20
where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.) =20

I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you=20
want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything. =20
Let me know. =20
