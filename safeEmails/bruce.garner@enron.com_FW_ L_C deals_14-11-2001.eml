Louise,

I am in town and would like to meet up with you when you get a chance but ha=
ve a hot question for you.

We have a new steel trade in London that is a back to back where we make $10=
0,000.  It has us issuing an LC but we will be receiving an LC from the purc=
hasers. Note we will get the LC from the purchaser prior to us posting an LC=
 to the producer. If we need to post cash we can discount the LC from the pu=
rchaser to post cash.=20

I think this meets the objectives but want to check with you.=20

thanks and I will set up a time on your schedule.

regards
bruce
