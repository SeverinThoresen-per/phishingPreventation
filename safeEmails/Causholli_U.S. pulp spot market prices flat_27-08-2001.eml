SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In U.S. East spot markets, no=
rthern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices held flat even as buyers i=
ndicated some low-priced deals in softwood transactions. Some industry sourc=
es indicated that a closing between list prices and spot transactions could =
point to tighter supplies in spot markets later this year. Prices for spot N=
BSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest held at $410-440/tonne, 11.5% belo=
w August contract prices, paperloop sources said. Although there have been a=
necdotal cases of buyers procuring NBSK at $400/tonne in the Northeast, a pr=
oducer asserted the deals must have come from one supplier.
Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also remained fla=
t, holding its $390-420/tonne range of two weeks ago.=20
Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), the only grade to hold flat in spot=
 markets two weeks ago, remained unchanged at $340-380/tonne. Evidently movi=
ng to protect pricing, some mills last week curbed supplies even though buys=
 were said to be available at typical spot prices. In a growing recent trend=
, one NBHK supplier closed a five-month deal at a fixed price of $370/tonne,=
 on the high end of current spot prices but barely covering its cash cost of=
 production.
Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) was unchanged and closed the week at=
 $330-370/tonne.=20
