It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20

e=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will als=

strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.
