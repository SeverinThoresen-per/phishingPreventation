It must be all the German blood coursing through my veins because I'm always=
 suspicious of such a positive result.  We should definately try some expone=
ntial smoothing (don't ask me anymore about this topic as I don't know anyth=
ing --- it's something to discuss with MT) to make sure these correllations =
are really that high.
