Alan

I spoke with John Nolan.=20

I gave John a summary of our legal position as advised by Watson Farley &=20
Williams. I also asked that he consider the potentially high cost of=20
commencing arbitration proceedings in London (including legal fees and flyin=
g=20
witnesses from Singapore to London).

John expressed a wish to commence proceedings against Hyundai. His analysis=20
is that since Hyundai would exeprience the same high cost of arbitration and=
=20
given the fact that they are Koreans (by that I presume he meant they are no=
t=20
inclined to be contentious), it may be worthwhile to pursue Hyundai in=20
addition to the vessel owners.

As for the legal advice of a weak case against Hyundai, he remains=20
unconvinced. John informs that he had been advised some time ago by legal in=
=20
Houston that he as seller was not able to withdraw supply until he had given=
=20
every opportunity to the buyer to perform. I do not know the facts of that=20
case and was not able to comment. John would like to speak with you on the=20
matter when he returns to Houston.

Meanwhile, I will be forwarding the legal opinions to John for his=20
consideration. He  is presently leaving Vienna for Munich and does not have=20
e-mail or fax facilities.  He will be contacting Russell from Munich to let=20
me have his fax  number there.

Regards

Matt
