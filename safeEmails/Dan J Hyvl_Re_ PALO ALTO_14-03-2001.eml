Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are=
=20
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require tha=
t=20
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we=20
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction=20
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a=20
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our=20
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download=20
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hea=
r=20
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in=20
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as=20
attached.
