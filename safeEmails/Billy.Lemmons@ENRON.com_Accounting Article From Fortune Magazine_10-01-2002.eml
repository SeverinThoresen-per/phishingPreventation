ACCOUNTING IN CRISIS=20
One Plus One Makes What?=20
The accounting profession had a credibility problem before Enron. Now it has=
 a crisis.=20
FORTUNE
Monday, January 7, 2002=20
Where were the auditors? People ask that question after every corporate coll=
apse, and lately they've been asking it with disturbing frequency. At Waste =
Management, Sunbeam, Rite Aid, Xerox, and Lucent, major accounting firms eit=
her missed or ignored serious problems. The number of public companies that =
have corrected or restated earnings since 1998 has doubled to 233, according=
 to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Now, following the =
stunning bankruptcy of Andersen's own client Enron, that question--where wer=
e the auditors?--has become a deafening refrain. "I believe that there is a =
crisis of confidence in my profession," Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino told a=
 congressional committee investigating Enron's collapse in mid-December. "Re=
al change will be required to regain the public trust."=20
The full story of the Enron debacle--and what Andersen did or did not do in =
its audit--will take months to emerge. In the meantime, no one disagrees wit=
h Berardino's diagnosis that there's a crisis in accounting--even if his sud=
den emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect attenti=
on from Andersen's own culpability. But the kind of "real change" required i=
s a matter of substantial debate. The government gave the franchise of audit=
ing public companies' financial statements to the accounting industry after =
the 1929 stock market crash. In the decades since, the accountants have adro=
itly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they can poli=
ce themselves. Now, post-Enron, they're doing it again. The Big Five CEOs is=
sued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strengthen financia=
l reporting and auditing standards. "Self-regulation is right for investors,=
 the profession, and the financial markets," the release concludes.=20
But is it? Accounting's main self-regulatory body, the Public Oversight Boar=
d, is a monument to the profession's failures. The POB was created in the la=
te 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at publi=
c companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in the ma=
jor auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigates al=
leged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which the ma=
jor accounting firms examine one another's procedures. And yet problems pers=
ist; arguably, they have grown more acute. "Is accounting self-regulation wo=
rking? On the face of it, it is not," says Representative John Dingell, the =
powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accounting professi=
on.=20
In their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many of=
 which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's complex=
 financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sophis=
ticated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA=
), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants exam=
ine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they are accu=
sed of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of those few f=
ailures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 billion becau=
se of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements since 1995.=
=20
Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been ac=
countants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the years,=
 the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into "professional ser=
vices" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profits f=
rom consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelters, =
and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SEC, hal=
f of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 1981.=20
Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused of=
 using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to sel=
l more-profitable consulting contracts. "Audit work is a marvelous marketing=
 tool," says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at Colu=
mbia University. "You are already there doing the audit. You say their inter=
nal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?" But t=
his requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management (consul=
ting). "You cannot serve them both," says former SEC commissioner Bevis Long=
streth.=20
This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 million=
 in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid both =
as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as its =
internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its books =
and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone raise=
d a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting fees, =
Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. "If you are auditing =
your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them," says Robert Wil=
lens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accounting profess=
ion's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen has not rev=
ealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off-balance-sh=
eet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed consulting fe=
es compromise their objectivity. "They have militantly refused to ever ackno=
wledge the possibility of a problem," Longstreth says.
