Sorry to hear about your grandmother.  Funerals, oddly enough, seem to creat=
e opportunities to catch up with other family members.  Nice to see everyone=
, you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together.  I will t=
alk with you soon.  --Sally=20

No problem!  I'm actually out Thursday / Friday this week at a family funera=
l.  Unfortunately, my Grandmother passed away last week, although it was pro=
bably a blessing - she was 84 and very ill.  So, why don't we catch up next =
week?

Thanks

Anna

Thanks for sending the attachments.  Didn't have a second to review them las=
t week, but this week should be more manageable.  I was in Austin this weeke=
nd to celebrate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.  Had the chance to hol=
d and rock my new niece who is now 9 weeks old.  I think that I failed to me=
ntion while you were here that her name is Anna.  Such a doll.  --Sally=20

Thanks for all your time in Houston and I'd be delighted to continue discuss=
ions around commercialisation whenever you want.

As promised, please find attached examples of our monthly management reporti=
ng.  They are still evolving - at the moment they are missing aged debtors /=
 creditors reporting (we should get in for June reporting once the function =
moves back into my area) and anything on Enron Credit.  However, comments an=
d thoughts welcome!

Kind regards

Anna
