Hi Andrew!

How are things in London? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are=20
getting a little tired of school. I don't blame you one bit.

I need a vacation. I bet you do to. What do you say to a little Amsterdam=20
trip in April? I think we deserve it.=20

What do you think of MH changing companies? I think he should get out of tha=
t=20
business altogether. He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.

Take care,

Chris
