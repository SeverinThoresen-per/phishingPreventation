I just had a brief talk with Tim Belden, and he likes just seeing the sale=20
side, so I think we are OK with the report as it stands.

Thank you for your quick response to my questions, and I will hold on to thi=
s=20
e-mail so that if I need to have a change in this report, I will be able to=20
communicate quickly.

Thanks,

Cara
