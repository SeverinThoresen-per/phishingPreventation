Mike, =20

Thanks for your message.  You are on point as to my intent.  From the=20
discussion I had with Andy last week, there seems to be several similarities=
=20
between the Metals business and industrial markets.  I believe the blueprint=
=20
that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you=20
all.  We would love to share this with you, and also discuss your system=20
direction.  There may be some opportunities for us to work together on the=20
development.  I would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps, an=
d=20
believe Andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday.  Le=
t=20
me know if you have some other ideas.

I'm sorry that we didn't have a chance to get together last week while I was=
=20
in London.  My trip was very short, and I kept missing you when I went to=20
your desk.  I'll plan some time with you when I'm there next time.   =20

It strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to=20
us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential=20
overlaps

Is there any obstacle to access to this information ?

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my "To Do" list today to=20
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and=
=20
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan=
=20
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physica=
l=20
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a "Blueprint" of EIM major=20
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics,=20
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The=20
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the=20
"Blueprint", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and=20
recommended systems.  A complete "roadmap" should be laid out with a=20
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan=20
addresses tactical also. =20

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and=20
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The=20
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional=20
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little=20
change to support new industries. =20

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit wit=
h=20
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Le=
t=20
me know how to proceed. =20

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers'=20
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality=20
between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals=20
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issue=
s=20
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less=20
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage=20
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Pau=
l=20
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on=20
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul=20
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in=20
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific t=
o=20
Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these ar=
e=20
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured=20
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either=20
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intr=
o=20
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME=20
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and=20
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by=20
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid wit=
h=20
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6=20
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made=20
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port=20
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points=20
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a=20
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David=20
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced=20
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London.=20
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy
