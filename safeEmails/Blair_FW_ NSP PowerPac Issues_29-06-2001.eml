Lynn,

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I came back and revi=
ewed the NSP powerpac agreement.  We were specifically looking for language =
in this agreement which may require us to true up for the customer regardles=
s of whether or not we were allocating storage on a given gas day.  We could=
n't put our finger on any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, =
2001) that requires us to true up for them, but perhaps we overlooked or mis=
interpreted something.  We would appreciate guidance from you or Bob using y=
our interpretation of the agreement with regard to the following issues:
According to the current agreement, what are our obligations to true up for =
the shipper  a) if we have allocated storage for a given gas day? and b) if =
the shipper fails to enter a nom for a given gas day?  Also, by what time is=
 the true up required to be made?=20

We would also like to clarify these same sort of issues for the Great River =
Energy powerpac, just to be certain that we are all in agreement as to how t=
hey are handled.  I'm anticipating that we may have future deals of this nat=
ure, so anything we can do to alleviate confusion in future agreements would=
 be beneficial.

Thanks for your help!

Kay
