Hi Amy. =20

Since you've taken over the responsibility for verbally confirming trades bo=
oked to John Arnold, Larry May, Mike Maggie, Dutch, and Andy Zipper, I just =
wanted to clarify that part of this responsibility includes clearing the tra=
des in Deal Capture/Structure.    When you verbally confirm a deal, you have=
 to click on Counterparty and Verify the deal, noting with whom you verballe=
d.  If you don't do this, the confirms group has no way of knowing whether o=
r not you've verbally confirmed the deal.

Also, in keeping with our global standards for sending out confirmations, ve=
rballing should be done on Trade Day -  although we give you until noon on T=
+1 before sending out your deals.  At that point, any trades that are not ve=
rbally confirmed will be generated and sent.  (This does not preclude the ne=
ed for you to follow up with deals not yet verballed). The exception to this=
 is, of course, if you have identified an economic discrepancy and "Actioned=
" the deal as such in TAGG - in this case we will wait until the Action has =
been cleared in TAGG. =20

Me or someone in my group can come over an show you the process in TAGG if y=
ou're unfamiliar with it.  (or Derek Bailey can show you too)

Give me a call if you have any questions or if this deviates from your under=
standing of the process.=20

Thanks,=20

PS - Also, can you or Errol let me know who in Risk is your backup for this =
function, as well as the brokered deals you check out?  Thanks.
