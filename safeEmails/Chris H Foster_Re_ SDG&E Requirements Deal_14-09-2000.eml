I think we could get below $60 on a 5 year deal with a bell shaped load=20

fact, I don't think Tim will want to sell the SDG&E zone at all.  If we offe=

it, it will be at a significant premium to SP-15. =20

We just showed SCE $58 for a 5 year peak (By the way, like the SDG&E RFP, th=

Chris --

I agree with you on the difficulty of a "true" full requirements deal.  I=20
assume what you are talking about is some pre-agreed to 100% load factor=20
energy delivery that could be different for each hour during the year (a sor=
t=20
of "load profile solution").  SDG&E would be responsible for +/- around this=
=20
delivery?  Maybe offer SDG&E an option on wide variations.

The other key issue I guess that is important is transmission congestion=20
risk.  Would EPMI be willing to agree to deliver the energy into the SDG&E=20
load zone or just to SP15?  It is my understanding that there is a=20
significant economic difference the SP15 and specific load zones?  Am I=20
correct in my thinking?

We probably need to beat $60/Mwh and leave $5/Mwh for the load following.  W=
e=20
may need to go even lower (if possible) to give SDG&E room to recover this=20
summer's high cost of power with the retroactive retail ratemaking back=20
through July 1, 2000.

On your issue of CPUC approval, that is exactly the play.  We need to walk=20
into the CPUC with an offer that it can't pass up (with or without SDG&E).

I've asked Thane Twiggs to get you the appropriate 8760 load profile for=20
SDG&E residential customers.  While the rate deal was broader, we could just=
=20
supply this customer group.

I'll call when we have the information.

Jim:

A couple thoughts...

I don't think Tim would be interested in a true "Full Requirements" deal tha=
t=20
would put us at risk for actual load.  If we could define "Full Requirements=
"=20
as a load profile that has been set ahead of time, and have SDG&E be at risk=
=20
for deviations from that profile, then I think we would be interested.  With=
=20
this structure, we could offer a fixed price equal to the weighted average=20
price of their load profile.  If that fixed price was lower than the SDG&E=20
embedded generation cost in rates we might have an angle. "Winning" such a=20
deal still seems like a pretty low probability event, given SDG&E's desire t=
o=20
RFP everything.  However, SDG&E's (and SCE's) main objective seems to be=20
pre-approved reasonableness review.  Since they can't make money on=20
commodity, at least they don't want to lose money.  Maybe we could get the=20
approval of the CPUC? SDG&E wouldn't mind buying from us if this is what it=20
took to get pre-approved reasonableness review. =20

If someone could get me that load profile information, I would be willing to=
=20
price it up.=20

Let me know what you think.
