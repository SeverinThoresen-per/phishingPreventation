Vicky,

Sounds like they've been working you to hard.  You certainly deserve a=20
vacation.  I would like to hear about your adventures overseas.  My address=20
is as follows:


   Andy Lewis
   3131 Timmons Ln
   Apt. 1010=20
   Houston, TX  77027



I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give=20
them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course,=20
getting time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your=20
trip, and I look forward to hearing from you.

-Andy
