Colleagues:

Stella Chan, Pat Keene and Harry Kingerski would like to communicate a=20
streamlined process to  provide Government and Regulatory support to URM=20
(Utility Risk Management).  The process strives to bring GA in the different=
=20
regions, in Houston and URM much closer to each other to provide and=20
implement GA service as completely, and cost-effectively as possible.  The=20
suggested process includes four steps, namely:  =20
Curve validation Process,=20
Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change,=20
Coordination of Strategy Development, and=20
Coordination of Strategy Implementation. =20
A description of these functions are as follows:
Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating,=20
every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's=
=20
books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review=20
period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA=20
personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved. =20
Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at=20
quantifying--in dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory=20
inputs on a specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in=20
progress.  This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel=20
(also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES=
=20
positions.  The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA. =
 =20
Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and=20
quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely=20
call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of=20
Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in=20
association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in=20
Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahom=
a=20
Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action=20
items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for=20
implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off=
,=20
and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if=20
necessary.
Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it=20
shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to=20
coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the=20
regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the=
=20
implementation as needed.  =20

To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage line=
s=20
of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall=20
coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional=
=20
wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:
 Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC,=20
SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL.=20
 Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).

=46rom the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by t=
he=20
Regional Directors  (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry=20
shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to=20
give regional managers and GA in Houston as much autonomy as possible and=20
shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the=20
regional directors (usually in the final sprint for approvals). =20

Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the=
=20
processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise.   I shall=20
contact you to take your suggestion for the most appropriate time for you an=
d=20
your group.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question and/or advise.
