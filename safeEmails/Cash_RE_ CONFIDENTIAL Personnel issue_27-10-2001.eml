Lizzette. Would you mind getting with Diane on the isue of online harassment=
 prevention training?  We have been looking into that form of delivering tra=
ining. Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training. I think that th=
e costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of The product. Would =
you mind taking the lead on this?  Obviously, this is not an issue with huge=
 time sensitivity. Thanks. Michelle
