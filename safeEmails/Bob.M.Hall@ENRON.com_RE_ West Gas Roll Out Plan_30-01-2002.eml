Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the clos=
e out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including=
 the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list=
=2E =20

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself f=
or the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them =
money, we should know that before we walk in the door).=20



Pls review and let's discuss....=20
