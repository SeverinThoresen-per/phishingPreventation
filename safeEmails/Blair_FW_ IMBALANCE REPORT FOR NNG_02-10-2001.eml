Lynn and Steve,
How hard would it be for someone in the logistics group to develop and distr=
ibute weekly a report on all of the NNG interconnects and the imbalances of =
all of the ones that we receive a report of the noms from scheduling.  I am =
talking about a report like TW gets from Richard Hanagriff that gives all of=
 the imbalances.   This would help Gas Control to keep a better idea of wher=
e we are with the other companies.  I have had other gas controllers ask me =
this same question.  Thank you both for your time and trouble in looking int=
o this for us.

                                              Sincerely,

                                               Margaret Hall
