If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and=20
fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible tha=
t=20
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case,=20
we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other=20
pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed=
=20
on to the plant.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker:

Our supply comes from Apache & Williams

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want i=
t
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we ca=
n

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant o=
r=20
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.
