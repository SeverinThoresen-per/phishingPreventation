Mark:

Thanks for meeting with us last week to discuss the Pan Nat Transaction.   I=
=20
think we have a strong legal position, however, I hope we can avoid=20
arbitration and reach agreement with Duke.  As I mentioned we will be meetin=
g=20
with John Sickman next Wednesday at 9:00 (without lawyers).   This meeting=20
will be the last commercial discussion before we exchange our "Initial=20
Positions" on the 21st of Nov as part of the arbitration process.

A call from you on Monday will assist in framing the meeting =20
(713-627-5515).  Specifically, can you relay the following to John:

1. As Duke called the meeting, we are interested in hearing their proposals=20
on the revised purchase price.  We do not intend to debate the interpretatio=
n=20
of the contract (does the price cap apply, Force Majeure, Loss of Supply,=20
etc.).

2. We have give then numerous counterproposals in the past and do not see=20
this as a meeting where they ask us to go away and develop a revised proposa=
l=20
on shipping, etc..   We are open to hearing their specific proposals.

3. We wish to resolve the situation expediently and we plan to continue with=
=20
the agreed schedule to exchange Initial Positions on the 21st of November.

4. Our side will be represented by decision makers.  We trust that they will=
=20
come to the meeting with the same level of commitment and authority - please=
=20
ask him who will represent Duke at the meeting.

Again, thanks for your help - good luck with the call.   I will be out of th=
e=20
office on Monday and Tuesday, but Jeff Hodge, Richard Sanders and/or Eric=20
Boyt can assist you with any details.

Regards,
Brian
