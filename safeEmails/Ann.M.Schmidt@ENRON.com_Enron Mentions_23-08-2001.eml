Gas Liberalization Turns Volatile For German Utility

Two years ago, the municipal utility in Heidelberg, Germany decided to do so=
mething very unusual for European utilities. It went shopping for natural ga=
s.=20
For more than 40 years, the utility, Stadtwerke Heidelberg, didn't have a ch=
oice in suppliers. As with other large industrial buyers of natural gas in E=
urope, it was locked into long-term supply contracts; in its case, with Ruhr=
gas AG and two other regional pipeline operators, which own most of the natu=
ral gas pipelines in Germany and are regulated by German authorities.
But in 1998, the European Union moved to deregulate Europe's natural gas mar=
ket, freeing factories, utilities and other large industrial gas purchasers =
to forgo their traditional suppliers and look elsewhere. The directive took =
effect in August 2000.=20
So when Stadtwerke Heidelberg's latest contract expired, it went shopping fo=
r gas, one of the first German utilities to do so.=20
"We wanted to show that it's possible to get gas from another supplier," sai=
d Peter Erb, the utility's manager of energy trading. "All the big players i=
n the German market were saying it's not possible." As for his traditional s=
uppliers, Mr. Erb said, "They were very angry."=20
In the end, Stadtwerke Heidelberg succeeded in finding an alternative suppli=
er, but the utility's troubles in the open market show just how difficult th=
e process can be.=20
The utility and its new supplier, Enron Corp. of the U.S., had to negotiate =
with Ruhrgas and the two other natural gas providers for six months before t=
hey could get access to transmission pipelines. They also had to navigate th=
rough a confusing thicket of tariffs, rules and technical requirements.=20
Although the EU's gas directive required pipeline owners to provide non-disc=
riminatory access to their system, it didn't make clear how that would be do=
ne. As many would-be gas suppliers quickly learned, negotiating such access =
can be very tough. The rules differ in different European nations and the pi=
peline owners can use the confusing regulations to their advantage to frustr=
ate competitors.=20
So far, there isn't "the degree of competition that the industrial gas users=
 expect from a liberalized market," said Francesco Balocco, energy issues ma=
nager at the European operations of Dow Chemical Co.=20
Energy consulting firm Dri-Wefa recently surveyed 59 large industrial gas bu=
yers, and found that while 40% have sought new gas contracts, only 12% have =
switched suppliers. The survey identified 13 new entrants into the gas-suppl=
y market, including incumbent national players expanding in other EU countri=
es and also large energy-trading firms such as Enron.=20
Stadtwerke Heidelberg started its effort to diversify its natural-gas purcha=
sing in December 1999, when it had just months remaining on its 20-year cont=
ract. Mr. Erb picked up the phone and started calling potential suppliers an=
d found the most interest at Enron's German headquarters. The Houston, Texas=
-based natural gas giant had grown explosively at home by competing for busi=
ness against monopoly gas providers, and it was looking to do the same abroa=
d.=20
It took the two companies six months to secure access to pipelines in German=
y. "It's absolutely natural for a network operator that is also competing in=
 the supply market to try to keep us off the network," said Paul Hennemeyer,=
 Enron's director of regulatory affairs. Enron's officials ran into constant=
 delays, were asked to supply more and more information and sometimes even h=
ad a hard time reaching the right people at the companies they were negotiat=
ing with, Mr. Hennemeyer said.=20
Ruhrgas says it was trying to be helpful, but argues that lengthy negotiatio=
ns were inevitable because it was tackling many access issues for the first =
time. "We made every contribution to provide for fair and easy access networ=
k access," said a Ruhrgas spokeswoman. "In the beginning, the system needed =
some time to develop." Shortly after a deal was reached, the German governme=
nt spelled out new rules on pipeline access, which will make future negotiat=
ions easier.=20
In Oct. 2000, Enron began to deliver gas to Stadtwerke Heidelberg, and to an=
other German municipal utility, which followed a similar negotiating path. S=
tadtwerke Heidelberg moved cautiously; it bought 30% of its natural gas from=
 Enron, with the remainder from its traditional suppliers. Enron and Stadtwe=
rke Heidelberg won't discuss the details of their contract, though both say =
Enron offered a cheaper price than Stadtwerke Heidelberg's other suppliers.=20
But the German utility quickly absorbed the cost-saving lessons of a deregul=
ated market:=20
Starting in October, the utility will drop Enron in favor of another company=
, Wingas, which has built a new pipeline to Heidelberg. The reason: a combin=
ation of a better price and the convenience of a new supply route.=20
"We obviously didn't break out the Champagne," Enron's Mr. Hennemeyer recall=
s. But he says Enron welcomes such switching of suppliers in general as a si=
gn of the free market.

To hear executives at Enron Corp. tell it, their company has been outgunned =
for years by the giant utilities in the lobbying battles in Washington over =
electricity policy.=20
"We're a little guy," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who served as chief executiv=
e of the Houston company until he quit last week. "We've been fighting a bat=
tle against some very big hitters."
=46rom 1992 to 1999, utilities spent large sums to keep electricity deregula=
tion at bay, helping to prevent Congress from taking any action to mandate i=
t at the local level and engineering a House restructuring bill generally vi=
ewed as favorable to utilities. That bill died in the House Commerce Committ=
ee in 1999.=20
"A ferocious lobbying campaign was waged" on retail deregulation, said a for=
mer Republican aide. Southern Co., the big Atlanta-based utility holding com=
pany, made its influence felt, he added.=20
In 1992, Southern hired Mississippian Haley Barbour to work for it in Washin=
gton. Barbour left in 1993 to serve as chairman of the Republican National C=
ommittee, a post he held until 1997. When he left the RNC, Southern again us=
ed his services.=20
After the GOP took control of Congress in 1995, the company also had direct =
access to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Senate Majority Leader Tre=
nt Lott (R-Miss.), who looked out for the company's utilities in their home =
states.=20
Reports filed last year with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission provid=
e other insights into the source of Southern's strength in the South. In 199=
9, its affiliates in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida reported spen=
ding more than $20 million on various civic, political and related activitie=
s, including $250,000 for the Birmingham Early Learning Center, $323,717 for=
 the Mississippi Power Foundation, and dozens of other gifts ranging from $5=
,000 to the Gulf Coast Symphony to $191,398 for community charities in north=
 Florida.=20
But Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay was cultivating his own GOP connections. A lo=
ngtime fundraiser and activist for former president George Bush, Lay and Enr=
on officials had contributed more than $550,000 to his son's presidential bi=
d by July 1999, according to the Center for Public Integrity.=20
Lay, according to a spokesman, has also helped raise money for House Majorit=
y Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) and for his Republican Majority Issues Committee, =
which was set up in 1999 to support House GOP members facing close races.=20
Nonetheless, Southern Co. still outspent Enron on lobbying in 1999 by $4.2 m=
illion to $1.9 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
"People talk about Enron being big and powerful," Skilling said. "I mean, co=
me on . . . the utilities were powerful adversaries. We're still a little co=
mpany compared to them."=20

ATLANTA -- Last of three articles=20
Ever since steamboat captain W.P. Lay founded Alabama Power Co. in 1906 to d=
evelop electricity along the Coosa River, utility companies have been string=
ing wires throughout the South for one purpose: so southerners could have po=
wer and light.
Now a bunch of outsiders, who buy and sell electricity but don't have a sing=
le retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line, have their sights set on thos=
e wires, and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Co=
ngress and the Bush administration.=20
Aided by supercomputers, and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey=
 rinks, the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along th=
e nation's power grid, then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the high=
est bidder. But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to whe=
re it is in strong demand, they want to remove what they contend is a "wire =
curtain" around the South. That means forcing the southeastern utilities to =
relinquish control of the wires to a new, federally supervised regional auth=
ority.=20
"The monopoly is the wires, and that's where the battles occur," said Jeffre=
y K. Skilling, who was chief executive of Houston's Enron Corp., the largest=
 of the power merchants, until he resigned last week.=20
The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation.=20
In 1992, with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overrun=
s on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new =
demands on the grid, Congress opted for a competitive market. The plan was t=
o dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovativ=
e electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand.=20
Now these new merchants of power, along with restructured utilities that hav=
e shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world, have become st=
rong advocates for a free-flowing, national electricity market. But in a cla=
ssic Washington lobbying confrontation, they are running into resistance fro=
m traditional utilities, exemplified by Atlanta's Southern Co., now the pare=
nt of Alabama Power and other southern utilities.=20
At issue is how fast the federal government, in the wake of the California e=
lectricity crisis, should push for yet more changes.=20
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recently stocke=
d with President Bush's pro-market appointees, ordered most utilities to neg=
otiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of thei=
r wires to a few big regional authorities. Those authorities, in turn, will =
build new transmission lines, do away with bottlenecks, set uniform rates an=
d ensure equal access to all. Next month, the Senate will take up proposals =
to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry.=20
But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers=
 in the South, according to executives at Southern Co., whose affiliates dom=
inate power sales in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north Florida. Southe=
rn Co., Chairman H. Allen Franklin said in a recent interview, "will not go =
blindly" into the system proposed by FERC.=20
Although unfettered access to Southern's 26,650 miles of lines might help lo=
ng-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron, company officials say =
it could mean congestion, power outages and higher prices for their 3.9 mill=
ion retail customers.=20
"When California was restructured, it was thought there would be massive sav=
ings," Franklin said. "Well, there haven't been."=20
Building the Power Trade=20
If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitiv=
e market in electricity, a visit to Houston dispels them.=20
In the city's energy alley, Enron Corp. -- with annual sales of more than $1=
00 billion last year, double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor =
office building adjacent to its 50-story tower. Enron's competitors, Dynegy =
Inc., Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy, are a few blocks away. Duke Energy =
North American, merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power, has settled in a=
s well. And Calpine Corp. plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story bui=
lding near Enron.=20
These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesal=
e market, which now handles about a quarter of U.S. electricity output. But =
it is still a work in progress, fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and=
 parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South.=20
In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new who=
lesale market, the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build u=
nregulated power plants outside their service areas. Many did. Quickest to e=
mbrace competition were California and the Northeast, which had long endured=
 high power costs. To spur competition, California and some northeastern sta=
tes went further, requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and=
 begin buying bulk power from wholesalers.=20
Many states went further still, ending their utilities' long monopoly over r=
etail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider.=20
The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of =
its experiments with power pooling, in which groups of utilities merge their=
 separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distr=
ibute their electricity.=20
Enron, formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies, was q=
uick to seize the opportunities. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a former officia=
l at the Federal Power Commission, FERC's precursor, during the Nixon admini=
stration, had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pi=
peline deregulation in the 1980s.=20
As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s, Lay and Skill=
ing, a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School, began =
applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets.=20
Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989, Skilling recalls. I=
ndependent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell th=
e power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract --=
 then sell the electricity back to Enron.=20
"We started creating forward and futures markets" using "a lot more financia=
l engineering" than was required in other commodity businesses, Skilling sai=
d. By the late 1990s, Enron was buying the output of generating plants days,=
 weeks, months and even years before it was produced, using sophisticated we=
ather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably s=
old.=20
During the past five years, Enron has been one of the nation's fastest-growi=
ng companies. Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this y=
ear, although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 hi=
gh of $90, mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity=
=2E Investors pushed the price still lower after Skilling's departure last w=
eek.=20
Southern Inhospitality=20
Like other merchants, Enron plunged into California after the legislature op=
ened up that giant state to electricity competition. But the Southeast remai=
ned less-friendly territory.=20
Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation. Florida goes =
so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for t=
he wholesale market.=20
The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wire=
s from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas. The we=
b of power lines, tied to the utilities' coal-, nuclear- and gas-fired gener=
ating plants, reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down int=
o neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles.=20
For Southern Co., its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge o=
f pride. In 1997, it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report.=20
Clustered around its borders are Entergy, another huge holding company that =
serves Louisiana, Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas; Florida Powe=
r & Light; Carolina Power & Light; Duke Power; and the federal government's =
centralized power giant, the Tennessee Valley Authority.=20
Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the =
lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices. Prices run=
 15 percent or more below the national average, thanks to a rich lode of coa=
l and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines th=
at carry the power generated by those fuels.=20
FERC, in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000, required utilities to open th=
eir wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much =
transmission capacity they have available at any given time. The message, a =
former official said, was "they couldn't use the wires to preclude others fr=
om getting their juice to market."=20
But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings =
made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lin=
es as part of their closed, plant-to-customer systems.=20
A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southe=
ast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region's utiliti=
es has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the=
 region.=20
FERC investigators cited Southern Co.'s refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc. co=
nnect to its transmission lines in Alabama. Southern said the added load "wo=
uld cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply."=20
In that case, FERC denied SkyGen's request for relief.=20
Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers suc=
h as municipal utilities in Southern's territory have become possible. But h=
e said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Sou=
thern that would enable it to sell such power regularly. Also, he said, Enro=
n cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid. "If I tri=
ed to buy transmission across Southern Co. to Jacksonville Electric, there'd=
 be zero available," Presto said.=20
Of the overall situation in the Southeast, he said that the utilities "give =
you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve th=
e rest of it for native load [retail customers]. So you have a huge highway =
that's supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn't available t=
o the wholesalers."=20
Southern Co. Chairman Franklin dismissed as "unfounded" the complaints of th=
e merchants, and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilit=
ies tied to Southern Co.'s lines say they generally have been treated well.=20
Robert Johnston, president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (M=
EAG), which supplies power to 48 towns, took issue with the notion of a wire=
 curtain.=20
"The market is growing in Georgia," he said. MEAG has its own trading room a=
nd has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power produ=
cers. It also has its own generators producing power at four sites, though S=
outhern Co. has an interest in all of them.=20
"There's not a grass-roots interest" driving the reforms, Franklin said. "It=
's the wholesale players."=20
While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast, though, Souther=
n itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market. Until it w=
as spun off as a separate company earlier this year, Mirant Corp., Southern =
Co.'s marketing subsidiary, competed in California, the Midwest and the Nort=
h, supplementing leaner profits from Southern Co.'s regulated units.=20
"Southern's strategy has been clear: Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at=
 home," said Allen Mosher, director of policy analysis at the American Publi=
c Power Association.=20
Well Connected for Battle=20
The next move is up to the federal government.=20
Next month, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural =
Resources Committee, plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded power=
s over wholesale transactions and transmission, so that "vested interests" w=
ill not be able to "manipulate the use of the transmission system" to benefi=
t their own plants, Bingaman's office said.=20
In the House, key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" T=
auzin (R-La.), whose state is home to Southern Co.'s western neighbor, Enter=
gy, and Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the energy and environment sub=
committee, who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility T=
XU.=20
Last week, Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., a Mississi=
ppi prote{acute}ge{acute} of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), to=
 handle regulatory and government affairs.=20
Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey=
 (R-Tex.), as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign, Edward=
 Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie & Associates.=20
Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (=
R-Tex.), the hometown Houston congressman, though it is uncertain how much i=
nfluence DeLay, an enthusiast for electricity deregulation, can bring to bea=
r.=20
Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meet=
ings that DeLay sponsored, but did not attend, could not reach consensus on =
electricity. As a result, the energy bill passed by the House on Aug. 2 skir=
ted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity r=
eliability.=20
Bush's election, and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastica=
lly into the competitive market, clearly has created a more favorable politi=
cal climate for the power merchants. Bush's first two appointees to FERC, Pa=
t Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell, moved quickly to fix what they viewed as =
the Washington electricity bottleneck.=20
Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competi=
tive energy market in Texas, where Wood headed the state's public utility co=
mmission. Brownell, a former Pennsylvania utility regulator, won praise from=
 Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contend=
ed would keep it out of the Philadelphia market.=20
On July 11, with a majority in tow, Wood, Brownell and William L. Massey, a =
Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition, tossed out prop=
osals by Southern Co. and other utilities and directed utilities throughout =
the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over =
control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizatio=
ns, or RTOs.=20
"It was about time [a bomb] was dropped," Wood said.=20
But FERC's action may only have been what power association's Mosher calls t=
he "beginning of a long movie."=20
Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are f=
earful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage po=
wer lines; western property-rights advocates; and state utility regulators. =
Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the=
 TVA, rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of =
new federal powers.=20
"There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-=
line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, shoul=
d there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability," said Re=
p. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Com=
mittee.=20
Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee fo=
r the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that h=
er state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or contr=
ol of their transmission lines "without our approval."=20
Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent=
 of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. "That's public property=
," she said.=20
In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co=
=2E's affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding.=20
"I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know=
 it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us," he said.=20
In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an "open question=
" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender contr=
ol of all their wires.=20
Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone to=
o far to "put the genie back in the bottle," according to a former FERC offi=
cial.=20
The power merchants readily concur.=20
"Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built=
 into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities," Enron's Presto said.=20

Relentless Search for Growth Humbles a Mutual Fund Star
By PATRICK McGEEHAN

c. 2001 New York Times Company

James D. McCall was one of Wall Street's best stock pickers in the late 1990=
's, his hand so hot that Merrill Lynch, eager to revive sales of its mutual =
funds, paid a ransom to his previous employer to win his services. Starting =
early last year, Merrill's brokers collected more than $1.5 billion from the=
ir clients for Mr. McCall to invest.=20
But in a breathtaking reversal of fortune, Mr. McCall has compiled one of th=
e worst investment records of the new century with that money. All but about=
 $650 million has been lost, leaving shares that cost many Merrill customers=
 more than $10 each worth slightly more than $2.
As of Tuesday, Mr. McCall's main fund, Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty, held the =
rare distinction of ranking in the bottom 1 percent among funds of its kind =
for the previous day, week, month, quarter and year, according to Morningsta=
r Inc., a company that analyzes mutual funds.=20
Though Mr. McCall is free to invest anywhere in the stock market, he has stu=
ck to a growth-seeking strategy that kept the fund invested primarily in tec=
hnology stocks throughout that sector's long, steep decline. Down almost 80 =
percent in the last year, the fund's performance has been significantly wors=
e than that of the average technology fund, let alone its peer group of more=
 diversified funds. It did, however, register aggressive gains in two market=
 rallies.=20
Lately, the Focus Twenty fund seemingly went from bad to cursed as some of M=
r. McCall's favorite stocks were laid even lower by a series of unfortunate =
surprises. His bigger holdings include Enron, whose shares fell 8 percent af=
ter its chief executive suddenly resigned, and Ciena, which dropped 30 perce=
nt in a day on disappointing earnings.=20
''It has been a miserable week,'' Mr. McCall allowed in an interview on Tues=
day. ''It's not easy managing a portfolio like this in this type of an envir=
onment.''=20
Mr. McCall's rapid rise and fall demonstrates how fleeting stock-picking sta=
rdom can be, said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group mutual fund c=
ompany. Too often, Mr. Bogle said, investors chase after the past returns of=
 the fund manager of the moment, only to find out they were pursuing a ''com=
et.'' (Investors in Vanguard's own aggressive growth fund, Vanguard Growth E=
quity, have had their shares drop 53 percent in value from their peak 17 mon=
ths ago.)=20
Still, Vanguard is known for its index funds -- the antithesis of Mr. McCall=
's stock-picking discipline -- and Mr. Bogle is indexing's most outspoken ch=
ampion. In speeches around the country, he has repeatedly and coyly -- avoid=
ing any mention of Merrill's name -- cited the giant brokerage firm's creati=
on of Focus Twenty and another fund in March 2000 as an example of racing to=
 cash in on the latest market fad.=20
In roughly five weeks, Merrill's brokers gathered a total of more than $2 bi=
llion for Focus Twenty and the Internet Strategies fund. Almost immediately,=
 those funds collapsed along with the Internet and technology stocks they ow=
ned. Internet Strategies, which Mr. McCall does not manage, never recovered =
and has now lost more than 80 percent of its value; Merrill plans to merge i=
t with another of its stock funds.=20
But Mr. McCall, 47, said his fund did not face a similar fate. Indeed, he sa=
id, Robert Doll, the chief investment officer for Merrill's funds, recently =
told the firm's brokers that Merrill was committed to Focus Twenty and its a=
ggressive, concentrated style.=20
Mr. Doll was not available for comment, but Merrill confirmed Mr. McCall's a=
ccount. ''We are committed to having a full range of investment styles, aggr=
essive growth being one of them,'' said a spokesman, Erik Hendrickson.=20
Funds seeking to rack up market-beating returns by making big bets on as few=
 as 20 stocks proliferated in the late 1990's, in part because of Mr. McCall=
's success managing the PBHG Large Cap 20 fund for Pilgrim Baxter, a fund co=
mpany in Wayne, Pa. In the two and a half years Mr. McCall ran it, the PBHG =
fund ranked first among its peer group -- funds that buy stocks of large com=
panies whose earnings are expected to grow quickly -- with average annual re=
turns of more than 50 percent.=20
It was those knockout numbers that brought Merrill calling in its search for=
 proven growth-fund managers to broaden the firm's value-oriented lineup of =
funds. After Mr. McCall accepted Merrill's job offer, Pilgrim Baxter sued to=
 stop him from breaking his employment contract. Mr. McCall countersued, and=
 Merrill later agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the litigation.=20
In court papers, Pilgrim Baxter disclosed that Mr. McCall had earned as much=
 as $1.5 million annually there. Mr. McCall and Merrill officials have repea=
tedly declined to reveal how much the firm paid Pilgrim Baxter or any detail=
s of Mr. McCall's compensation at Merrill. Often, however, investment return=
s affect the pay of fund managers.=20
Like Focus Twenty, most of the concentrated funds sank last year with the co=
llapse of technology stocks. The managers of some of those funds, including =
Marsico Focus, have shifted money out of volatile technology and telecommuni=
cations stocks and into more mature companies, like Citigroup and Omnicom, w=
hich owns ad agencies.=20
Mr. McCall sniffed at some of those choices, saying that the fund managers w=
ere not staying true to their mission of aggressive growth investing.=20
''I'm not going to own an Omnicom,'' he said, ''or a Sony or a Viacom or Gen=
eral Dynamics, because they're growing in the single digits.'' Thomas Marsic=
o, the manager of Marsico Focus and one of the original concentrated-fund ma=
nagers, did not return a call seeking comment.=20
Mr. McCall said he would continue to try to identify the companies that have=
 the best chance of increasing their profits at extraordinary rates, regardl=
ess of what value other investors are assigning to those prospects at any gi=
ven time.=20
''Valuation is not one of the factors that enters into our methodology,'' Mr=
=2E McCall said.=20
About 70 percent of Focus Twenty's assets are in technology stocks, accordin=
g to Morningstar. But the fund's biggest holding now is Idec Pharmaceuticals=
, a drug maker.=20
Kunal Kapoor, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Merrill's funds, calls Mr. Mc=
Call a momentum investor who seeks ''growth at any price.'' Mr. McCall may b=
e the best investor of that stripe, Mr. Kapoor said, but the strategy is so =
risky that he questions whether it was ever appropriate for so many of Merri=
ll customers.=20
''I was really surprised by the amount of funds they were able to raise for =
a fund like that in such a short time,'' Mr. Kapoor said. ''The question is:=
 Do you really need a fund like this?''=20
Reading a prepared statement, Mr. Hendrickson said Merrill Lynch considered =
concentrated funds to be ''an appropriate option'' for some investors, becau=
se they ''maximize the impact of professional stock-picking over the long te=
rm and additionally may serve as an alternative to individual stock holdings=
=2E''=20
He pointed out that Merrill managed another concentrated fund, Merrill Lynch=
 Focus Value, that had performed well this year, gaining more than 3 percent=
=2E=20
As for Mr. McCall's returns, Mr. Kapoor said he could not fault Focus Twenty=
 because it had performed as would be expected for a fund of its composition=
=2E It rang up some of the biggest gains of any fund in two brief periods wh=
en the market picked up -- the third quarter of 2000 and April of this year =
-- and some of the biggest losses when the market was down.=20
Rather, he said he was more disappointed with the other fund Mr. McCall mana=
ges, the Merrill Lynch Premier Growth fund, which is supposed to be less vol=
atile because it holds about 50 stocks. That fund is down more than 50 perce=
nt this year and has shrunk to less than $100 million in assets.=20
Mr. McCall said that he had warned Merrill's brokers all along just how vola=
tile his returns could be and that Focus Twenty was no place for investors t=
o put money they might need any time soon.=20
But, he said, he thinks that now, more than ever, is the time to take a chan=
ce on the fund, with its shares selling for about $2.20.=20
''I don't think $2 a share is a lot to risk,'' the indomitable fund manager =
said. ''We could go down from here certainly, but over the long term, there =
is more potential on the upside than on the downside.''

If the state of New York avoids brownouts this summer, it will be due in a s=
mall way to the efforts of Andrew Gillespie, a young electricity trader who =
works for Mirant Corp. in an Atlanta suburb.=20
Mirant grew out of Atlanta-based Southern Co.'s aggressive attempt to enter =
the unregulated market that was developing outside its home region. Early th=
is year, Southern spun off Mirant as a separate company that Wall Street sto=
ck traders value at about $11 billion.
Gillespie spends much of the day staring at a map of New York that glows gre=
en on his computer screen. The map displays the prices at which electricity =
is selling at key points on the state's power grid.=20
One summer day, Gillespie called a trader who buys electricity from New Engl=
and's centralized power pool, which manages power sales from regional utilit=
ies such as New England Power, Boston Edison and Central Maine Power.=20
He agreed to buy 14 megawatts over a 16-hour period the next day and pay abo=
ut $9,000. He used the phone to offer the power to the New York Independent =
System Operator, a nonprofit organization set up to manage the state's whole=
sale market and its high-voltage transmission system, for a small markup.=20
Then he waited to find out whether the offer was accepted. If it was, he wou=
ld go online to book a transmission route. If not, he would unload the power=
 on another trader in the over-the-counter market, made up of merchant compa=
nies such as Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy North America, Reliant En=
ergy, El Paso Merchant Group, Calpine Corp. and Entergy-Koch Power Marketing=
=2E=20
Traders like the Northeast because it allows one-stop shopping. "If I want t=
o wheel power from Maine through Massachusetts to Connecticut, I pay just on=
e transmission charge rather than having to call each utility and schedule i=
t," said Michael Hobbs, Mirant's marketing director for the northeastern Uni=
ted States.=20
In the South, traders say, booking transmission can be a lot more complicate=
d -- and sometimes impossible. Utilities operate their own contained systems=
 and advise traders when and if they have "ATC," available transmission capa=
city.=20
Electricity trading is a commodity business not unlike selling wheat, platin=
um or hog bellies, though it is trickier than most, according to Marce Fulle=
r, Mirant's chief executive, because electricity can't be stored.=20
"Information is paramount," Hobbs said, so Mirant traders keep a constant ey=
e on weather reports and also consult the company's on-site meteorologist. T=
o provide further assistance, a digital board that wraps around the trading =
room updates information ranging from the temperature and humidity in Brazos=
 County, Tex., to the spot price of electricity at "COB," traders' slang for=
 the California-Oregon border.=20
The jobs of the traders at Mirant, Enron and the other companies didn't exis=
t a few years ago, and neither did most of the companies. Regulated utilitie=
s, co-ops and a few big government power agencies, such as the Tennessee Val=
ley Authority, generated almost all of the power and shipped it to retail cu=
stomers over their own wires.=20
Now roughly a quarter of the electricity produced in the United States comes=
 from unregulated companies that sell almost exclusively to the long-distanc=
e bulk-power trade -- the wholesale market.=20

LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Copper prices rebounded in London Metal Exchange =
(LME) pre-market trade on Thursday, having fallen through the psychological =
$1,500 a tonne level the previous evening, traders said.=20
"There was nothing on the close last night to suggest anything happening, an=
d there was no interest overnight, but this morning we've seen a number of t=
he electronic screens - particularly Enron - being marked higher," said one =
senior trader.
Three months copper was indicated at $1,513/1,515 at 0850 GMT, up $11 from W=
ednesday's evening kerb close.=20
"The market hasn't given up the ghost yet. There's still some room to push h=
igher, with minor technical resistance around $1,525," the trader said.=20
With consumer buying still largely absent, trading conditions remained subdu=
ed, however.=20
"The appeal of the markets is limited at the moment. Too many fingers have b=
een burned - you can still see a lot of the specs sidelining themselves," th=
e trader said.=20
"We've suffered consumer destocking in the first and second quarters. There'=
s a bit of weakness in the U.S. dollar, which is helpful, but business confi=
dence isn't great."=20
Despite periodic short-covering rallies, the overall downtrend remains in pl=
ace pending concrete evidence of an upturn in the economic situation, analys=
ts said.=20
"The short-term moving averages may be a bit more constructive after last we=
ek's rally, but the trend is still down. I remain sceptical for the time bei=
ng," the trader said.=20
Aluminium also pushed higher in early trade, indicated up $5 at $1,428/1,430=
=2E=20
Initial resistance is evident at $1,430 with a stiffer upside barrier at $1,=
440, analysts said.=20
Nickel edged up $20 to $5,720/5,750, shrugging off news that Russia's Norils=
k Nickel had restarted work at its key nickel plant, which was halted after =
an accident on Sunday.=20
"The third smelting furnace started working at 0400 local time (2000 GMT) on=
 August 23," spokesman Yevgeny Yerokhin told Reuters. "By this time another =
two furnaces had already started working."=20
"The plant will fully restore its production volumes by the end of the day o=
n August 24," he added.=20
The smelting division of the nickel plant, in the Norilsk region on the nort=
hern Siberian Taimyr peninsula, was halted on Sunday after a leak of melted =
metal damaged water cooling systems and electricity supply lines.=20
The plant's management has promised to catch up with the output arrears stem=
ming from the accident within a month.=20
The rest of the complex was little moved in early trade.=20
Zinc was indicated unchanged at $849/852, showing little response to overnig=

Lead was also unchanged at $480/483, with tin up $10 at $3,870/3,900 and all=

Papers on Dabhol project not received

08/23/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The consumers' representative for the Maharashtra Electricity regula=
tory Commission (MERC), ``Prayas,'' has not yet received the sheaf of docume=
nts from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) concerning the Dabho=
l power project (DPC) which it had asked for.=20
The MERC had passed an order on July 31 asking the MSEB to furnish the finan=
cial documents relating to some contracts signed by Enron for the project. T=
he MSEB is learnt to be now examining the legality of making these documents=
 public after a stern letter from the Dabhol Power Company, pointing out tha=
t the board might be liable for ``damages and legal action'' if the contract=
ors take offence to making the documents public.
Enron wrote to the MSEB a few days after the order, contending that most of =
these documents had confidentiality clauses which would make it actionable. =
Asked about this, sources at DPC said that suppliers would be upset if their=
 terms and conditions were made public since Enron's is only one of the plan=
ts sourcing business from them. For instance, Enron's LNG fuel supply contra=
ct with an Oman company has a confidentiality clause and would fear exposing=
 its contract terms to the public in view of the fact that over 80 per cent =
of its supply is concentrated in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. ``It would be dama=
ging for its business if our deal, which is less than 18 per cent of its bus=
iness, ends up influencing its other deals,'' the source said.

INDIA: ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive...

ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive=20
By Alan Wheatley, Asian Economics Correspondent
NEW DELHI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - After six months of political stalemate, the r=
ave reviews for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's reforming budget have give=
n way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps India embraces change only i=
n a crisis.=20
In which case, a new wave of reforms might not be far away.=20
For unless growth picks up substantially from last year's 5.2 percent pace, =
policy experts said India would face a further deterioration in its public f=
inances and rising unemployment that could put the world's largest democracy=
 under serious strain.=20
"We can't go on without further reforms for very long because we won't be ab=
le to grow even by five percent," said Shashanka Bhide, chief economist of t=
he National Council of Applied Economic Research.=20
"So the crisis is already there. If we're not going to get six percent-plus =
growth rates, then it's a political problem."=20
There is a broad consensus - on paper - on the need for a second wave of ref=
orms to build on ground-breaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a b=
alance-of-payments crisis in 1991.=20
Because its economy is fairly closed, India has weathered the current global=
 downturn much better than most of its Asian neighbours, who would be deligh=
ted with five percent growth.=20
Still, output has slowed for two years in a row as post-reform momentum has =
petered out. And crucially, five percent growth falls far short of the 8.7 p=
ercent average needed over the next decade to achieve Prime Minister Atal Be=
hari Vajpayee's goal of doubling per capita income, currently around $460 a =
year.=20
"Eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent =
growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed, which means ther=
e will be greater social unrest," said P Chidambaram, a former finance minis=
ter.=20
"A five percent growth rate, while statistically acceptable, is simply polit=
ically unacceptable and socially unacceptable."=20
COMPETITIVE POLITICS=20
It was to raise the economy's speed limit that Sinha unveiled in his Februar=
y budget a raft of far-reaching structural reforms making it easier to fire =
workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for smal=
l and medium-sized firms.=20
The reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in India =
but they soon became mired in what the Planning Commission aptly calls the "=
compulsion of competitive politics".=20
On a charitable view, the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kale=
idoscope that is India's multi-party democracy.=20
"This is not a country, this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in=
 the political domain, the social domain and the economic domain," said Amit=
 Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce a=
nd Industry.=20
Less charitably, the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfee=
bled Vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy 19-party coalition and force mi=
nisters to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests oppo=
sed to change.=20
Arjun Sengupta, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, said the abse=
nce of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its=
 own furrow, resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly need=
ed investment.=20
"This is the main problem we have today: we do not have a coherent, unified =
policy framework," Sengupta said.=20
He said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult bec=
ause India's most populous and backward states were falling farther and fart=
her behind the better-off ones.=20
"If the Centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the sta=
tes, we are facing major problems which can become explosive," Sengupta, a f=
ormer ambassador and IMF official, said.=20
Peering through the gloom, optimists point to the precedent of legislation p=
assed without the pressure of a crisis in 1999 to open up India's insurance =
market to foreign firms.=20
They hope two equally controversial reform bills, to liberalise the crisis-r=
idden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms, will als=
o eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week, ending mo=
nths of wrangling.=20
"Anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn't looked =
at figures on poverty very closely," said Planning Commission member N.K. Si=
ngh. He said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to 27 percent fr=
om 37 percent.=20
REFORM PRIORITIES=20
The list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy. Because o=
f its pivotal role in the economy, the power sector is many experts' number =
one priority. The well-catalogued troubles that foreign firms such as Enron =
Corp have encountered dealing with India's all-but-bankrupt state power boar=
ds have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors.=20
Domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twic=
e as much as they would in China for electricity.=20
Nevertheless, attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political ro=
cks: how to end overmanning at the power boards, estimated at 50-70 percent,=
 and how to charge users, mainly farmers, market rates for stolen or heavily=
 subsidised power.=20
D.K. Srivastava, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and=
 Policy, said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be ass=
ured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek re-election two=
 or three years later.=20
"Any government under any minister will say to you, How can I survive unless=
 I can show my voters jobs?'," Srivastava said. "This is one of the basic co=
nstraints on power sector reform."=20
T.K. Bhaumik, a senior adviser at the Confederation of Indian Industry, agre=
ed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the cas=
e for change to India's mass poor.=20
"We did not articulate the economic reform process to the people," Bhaumik s=
aid. On privatisation, for instance, policy-makers did not spell out the con=
sequences for jobs.=20
"I don't think we really understood the issues properly. We simply followed =
the Washington consensus and that didn't go down well with the people," he s=
aid.=20
As Divestment Minister Arun Shourie knows only too well. The privatisation p=
rogramme he oversees, a litmus test of India's reform will, is stalled becau=
se of what Shourie calls "fractured" politics and "noise" generated by corpo=
rate interests.=20
Shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt India's politi=
cians into putting the country's interests first.=20
"We're on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and I feel the r=
eal circumstances in which India is placed will force the political class to=
 do the right thing," he said.
