Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next w=
eek in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsi=
bilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bis=
ignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions=
 that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Sm=
ith Barney. =20

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall=
, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these mo=
re detailed discussions. =20

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.=
  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.=
   =20

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sall=
y=20
