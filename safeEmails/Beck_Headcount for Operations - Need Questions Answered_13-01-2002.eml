I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 1=
84 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 18=
4 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 wi=
thout that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 curre=
ntly for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviou=
sly a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasib=
le that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.
=20
We  need some questions answered first to go through this:
=20
1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power L=
ogistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going=
 in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reduc=
tions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to=
 coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.
=20
2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is h=
ow many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticip=
ated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the bus=
iness scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the questio=
n. =20
=20
3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we antic=
ipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical g=
as business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount =
for all of 2002?
=20
4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views =
from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There we=
re some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of=
 transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, me=
ntioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that =
instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That =
is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would mak=
e a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to kno=
w those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we =
just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS=
, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend t=
o get there view of what is required?
=20
5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e=
=2E will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS a=
ssume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What ab=
out consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data =
to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sen=
ding info to UBS?
=20
We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible numbe=
r. =20
