Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit is=
sues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL =
OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as =
their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me=
 that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) =
issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to =
me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC=
 is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their =
request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of =
this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various leg=
al/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerou=
s.

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e.=20

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under =
ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, tho=
ugh if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to=
 ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively ca=
ncels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and oth=
er European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them =
back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two=
 WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to =
be doing more such deals.=20

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our st=
rategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA=
 only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and=
 legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European=
 product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you=
 and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle=
 we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston=
 okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 othe=
r solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara=
 knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-con=
suming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

=46rom the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backin=
g the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to th=
e funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other wor=
ds, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily ma=
rgining, etc. will  be incorrect.=20

=46rom the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL =
wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to =
trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products=
 that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread produc=
ts like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily=
 met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as abov=
e, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be d=
etrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaini=
ng now.=20

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if cr=
edit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the gene=
ral terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they wil=
l not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be =
other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well a=
s the trading/back office side.=20
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a=
 list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only wi=
th ENA.

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the =
right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade bet=
ween ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trad=
er agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located i=
n Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London=
).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit=
 risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should=
 be with ECTRIC.=20

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreemen=
t on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all pa=
rties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with =
Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA en=
ters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials thr=
ough EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact=
 with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America)=
=2E As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of =
America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book=
 a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of Ameri=
ca. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of bo=
oking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with EC=
TRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya
