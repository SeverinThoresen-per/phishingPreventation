Gerald--

As we briefly discussed, I have been assigned the task of negotiating a=20
gathering agreement with Wildhorse Energy related to an Enron Capital=20
Resources  project (...I think that is the Finance group's new name).

I hope to have the first draft from Wildhorse tomorrow.  If so, I'll give yo=
u=20
a copy in person and follow-up via e-mail.

Here are some of the challenges (in my opinion):

-- The finance group (Scott Josey) has established a deadline of June 30 (fo=
r=20
reasons we can discuss later); Kinder-Morgan and Tom Brown (Wildhorse) have=20
already proven to be a very slow movers.

-- Wildhorse utilizes the same law firm as ThunderCreek, so the "standard"=20
gathering agreement may include some goofy language thereby delaying turn(s)=
=20
of the documents.

-- Short deadline decreases my leverage (actually, I'm getting levered) and=20
therefore my ability to negotiate what I consider to be a "good" deal.

Okay, we're crossing over to my own psychological/PRC issues...anyway, I'll=20
contact you ASAP upon receipt of contract drafts to discuss the deal in=20
detail as well as a strategy going forward.

Thanks (in advance) for the assistance.

Dan=20
