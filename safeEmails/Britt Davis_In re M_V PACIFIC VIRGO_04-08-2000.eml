Dear Matt,

 As of noon today, I have conferred with everyone that I have been asked to=20
contact regarding possible Enron relationships with Mitsubishi Corporation,=20
and have either been told that there is no problem, or that (in Joe Hirl's=20
case) no objection will be made under the circumstances.   Accordingly, I=20
believe you and David should go forward with notifying Mitsubishi of ECT's=20
intentions (per David's previously-submitted draft) Monday.=20

 After you give the notification to Mitsubishi, you may wish to give Joe Hir=
l=20
a call and so advise him, as he asked to be kept abreast of matter so that h=
e=20
would not be blind-sided.  Assuming Joe is not an ECT employee, you may wish=
=20
to exercise caution in what you communicate to him, for privilege reasons=20
(David can give you guidance on this under U.K. law).  If this proves to be =
a=20
problem for you or Joe, let me know. =20

 Also, Joe Hirl advised me that John Chismar told him that the contamination=
=20
damage sustained by ECT could be/would be much greater than approximately=20
$300,000.  While I understand that to be the case, given that we have not=20
disposed of the cargo that was offloaded in Thailand, I wonder if you could=20
let me know what John told Joe the damages might be (assuming that John gave=
=20
Joe a figure).

 Many thanks.

      Regards,
      Britt
