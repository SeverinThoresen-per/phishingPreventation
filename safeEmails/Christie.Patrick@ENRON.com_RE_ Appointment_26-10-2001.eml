Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a=
 personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy t=
o "field" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) wo=
uld not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January=
=2E  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact h=
im directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   Ho=
wever, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looki=
ng for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, =
we are putting together a "master Plan"" financial relationship with UT over=
all (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting=
 engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me=
 to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of th=
ose personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th=
!
=20
Thanks and kisses!!

Thanks much and take care.=20
