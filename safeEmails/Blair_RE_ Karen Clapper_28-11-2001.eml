Do you want me to call it a transfer or a data correction?  Also, what effec=
tive date should I use? =20

I think we should use Jan. 1st for all corrections if we are changing compan=
y number to be on the safe side with regard to the employees' tax deductions=
=2E  Let me know what you think.  We will probably get many co./cost center =
change requests for the new year. =20

Thanks,
Miranda
