I was merely poking fun at those who are complaining about the size of the d=
eer herd on our place.  I certainly don't have any complaints, especially if=
 I get a shot at an exotic or two.

			I agree, we started out with 3, went to 1, no we are going in the wrong d=
irection again.  By the way, wasn't Mertz supposed to add more acreage to th=
is ranch?  I think we have hunted everything we can on ol' Autry.

					B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a h=
ead
					of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while the=
y
					were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out a=

					Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a sp=
ot.
					His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Look=
ing
					for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out

d
					would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
				=09
					He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, bu=
t I
					don't care about that.
				=09
					Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
					proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe wind=
s up
					taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left wit=
h two
				=09
					spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer=
 this
				=09
					spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I ca=
