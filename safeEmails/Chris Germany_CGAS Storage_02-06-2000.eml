I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for=20
June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in=20
the end of the month.

On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.

This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.
