> I was told a story recently about a person who had his briefcase stolen
> while on a business trip.  He lost everything.  Inside the briefcase was
> his passport, wallet, house keys, car keys and cash.  I guess no one told
> him NOT to keep everything in one place!  He immediately went back to his
> hotel room and dialed the numbers listed below. The only thing the thieves
> got was a free tank of gas.  They literally filled their tank within 2
> blocks of the hotel.  But that is all they got.  After calling the numbers
> below, the next call was to the local police department.  A call was then
> made to  his hometown Department of Motor Vehicles and Social Security
> office.  He  then called his wife requesting she get all the locks changed
> on the house and cars immediately.  This is excellent advice.  Another
> good piece of advise is to place the contents of your wallet on a
> photocopy machine, do both sides of each license, credit card, etc.  You
> will know what you had in your wallet along with the account numbers and
> the phone numbers to call in case you need to cancel.  Keep the copy in a
> safe place.

> We have all heard horror stories about fraud that is committed using
> someone else's name, address, social security number, credit, etc.  Here
> is some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to
> you.  As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately,
> but the key is having the toll free phone numbers and your credit card
> numbers handy so you will know whom to call.  Keep these where you can
> find them easily.  File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction
> where the theft occurred.  This proves to credit providers you were
> diligent.  It is also the first step toward an investigation.  But here's
> what is perhaps most important (I never thought of doing this) - Call the
> three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a FRAUD
> ALERT on your name and social security number.  The alert means any
> company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen. They
> have to contact you by phone, at a number you provide, to authorize any
> new credit

> The numbers are:  Equifax : 1-800-525-6285, Experian (formerly TRW) :
> 1-888-397-3742, Trans Union : 1-800-680-7289
>=20
> Also make a call to:  Social Security Administration (fraud line):
> 1-800-269-0271.

> I hope you never need this information.  If you do, I hope you find it
> helpful.  Feel free to share this e-mail with others.  Together,  we can
