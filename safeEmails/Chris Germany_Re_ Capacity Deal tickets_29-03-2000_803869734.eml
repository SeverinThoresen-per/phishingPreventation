Chris,
Will you have the same contract # and the same Pipeline under Market East
and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos.
and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise.

Subject: Capacity Deal tickets

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up=20
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,=20
and Tenn will be set up under both desk. =20

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. =20
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes=20
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same=
=20
contract under both desk.


Comments/questions?
