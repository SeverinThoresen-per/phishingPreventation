Davis reveals makeup of Power Authority

Gov. Gray Davis drew yesterday from his own inner circle and the business wo=
rld to create a public Power Authority that takes control this week over Cal=
ifornia's energy future.=20
Davis' four appointments will join state Treasurer Phil Angelides in forming=
 the new five-member board, which can issue billions of dollars in bonds, bu=
ild and purchase power plants and gas pipelines, and ultimately attempt to s=
ecure a surplus of energy for California.
"It's partly a matter of filling the hole that the private sector is not fil=
ling," Angelides said, "but it's also building a system so we are never agai=
n victimized by markets that are unregulated and out of control."=20
Davis appointed S. David Freeman, who is expected to be named chairman of th=
e authority's new board. A longtime advocate of public power and energy cons=
ervation, Freeman is the former head of the Tennessee Valley Authority and t=
he Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He is currently one of Davis' =
closest energy advisers.=20
Davis also appointed Sunne Wright McPeak, former Contra Costa County supervi=
sor and president of the Bay Area Council, a business group that studies how=
 economic growth affects the quality of life. She also has worked extensivel=
y on water policy and the future of the bay-delta ecosystem.=20
John R. Stevens, Davis' former staff director and current energy adviser, al=
so joins the board.=20
One Davis appointment yesterday drew cautious concern from consumer advocate=
s because of his links to the energy industry: Donald Vial, a former Public =
Utilities Commissioner appointed by then- Gov. Jerry Brown.=20
Vial currently is the chairman of a San Francisco nonprofit foundation that =
includes labor and environmental activists, but also executives from some of=
 the country's largest energy firms, utilities and developers.=20
The group, the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, mos=
tly holds seminars with various interest groups on business and environmenta=
l issues. Its board of directors include executives from Mirant, Calpine, Pa=
cific Gas and Electric Co., Enron Corp., Reliant, AES, and Sempra Energy com=
panies. McPeak also serves on the board.=20
Consumer activists said Vial's work with the foundation mostly includes educ=
ation and public policy research, although they said his connection to the e=
nergy industry is troubling. When Vial was a PUC commissioner, from 1983 to =
1989, he expressed deep concerns about deregulation, advocates said.=20
"I think he was a friend of the consumer and he was a friend of labor," said=
 Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network based in San =
Francisco. "He was very opposed to most of deregulation and very distressed =
about the notion of competition in the electricity area, and felt early on t=
hat this was not going to be good for consumers."=20
Doug Heller with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said Vial'=
s appointment is "awkward" and raises questions about the mission of the aut=
hority. In his statement, Davis said the new power authority's job "is to su=
pplement, not supplant private sector initiatives," but Heller said the auth=
ority should swing the other way.=20
"We are creating a public power system because the private energy industry h=
as not only failed California it has devastated the state," Heller said. "Th=
e public power authority should not be attached in any way to the private co=
mpanies that have ravaged California."=20
A Davis spokesman said Vial was a good choice.=20
"You can put his (Vial's) public record when it comes to consumers against a=
nybody's," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Davis, adding: "This guy isn'=
t anyone's lackey."=20
All of Davis' appointees must be confirmed by the state Senate.=20

INDIA PRESS:Dabhol Pwr, Govt Conciliation Talks Begin Sat

Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co., a unit of U.S. energy major Enron =
Corp. (ENE), and the government of India will begin their first round of con=
ciliation talks Saturday in a bid to resolve a long-standing payment dispute=
, reports The Financial Express.=20
DPC had invoked the government of India's counter-guarantee earlier this yea=
r on account of nonpayment of electricity bills worth $48 million by its sol=
e buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Under the counter-guarante=
e, the government of India is liable to pay the foreign equity holders in DP=
C in the event of the failure of the Dabhol power project.
The DPC's counsels will argue their case before a panel of three conciliator=
s, of whom one is appointed by DPC and one by the government, while the thir=
d has been jointly chosen by both parties.=20
"We are quite hopeful and will try to solve things through the conciliation =
route. However, if this process fails, we will settle the dispute by the arb=
itration route," the newspaper quoted Dabhol Power Company's managing direct=
or, K. Wade Cline, as saying.=20
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in DPC. The Dabhol power plant, which ha=
s an installed capacity of 740 megawatts, is located in the western Indian s=
tate of Maharashtra. The plant has not been operating since May 29, after MS=
EB stopped drawing power, saying DPC's tariffs were exorbitant and unafforda=
ble. MSEB also refused to pay several of its bills. The DPC-MSEB dispute is =
in court.=20

BHP Billiton Examining Merits Of Energy Trading Desk

MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Australia-based mining heavyweight BHP Billiton Ltd.=
 (BHP) said Tuesday the creation of an energy trading desk is one of several=
 options being considered by the newly merged group.=20
"BHP Billiton's new marketing function is examining a range of value creatio=
n opportunities to deliver enhanced customer solutions based on the group's =
exposure to energy-based commodities, including the concept of an energy tra=
ding desk," a company spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires.
"BHP Billiton is both a major producer of energy and major consumer of energ=
y," she said.=20
"Our desire is to maximize the value of our energy position. Given the early=
 stage of the merger integration, it isn't possible to provide further detai=
ls of the activities in this area at this time," the spokeswoman said.=20
A report Monday in U.K. daily The Times said BHP Billiton is establishing an=
 energy trading business in Singapore, signaling the group's commitment to i=
ts oil and gas assets.=20
The newspaper also reported that the trading unit will seek to balance the c=
ompany's exposure to energy markets across its oil, gas and mining businesse=
s.=20
BHP Billiton's strategy is to emulate U.S. power giant Enron (ENE), which us=
ed its long position in electricity to sell hedging and derivative products =
to energy users, the report said.=20
At 0157 GMT, shares in BHP Billiton were up 14 cents or 1.5% at A$9.44. The =
broader market was marginally weaker.=20
