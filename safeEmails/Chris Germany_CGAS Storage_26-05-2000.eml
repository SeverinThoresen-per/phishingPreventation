I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this=
=20
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this=
=20
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the=20
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.
