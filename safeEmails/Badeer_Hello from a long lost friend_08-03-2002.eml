Paul,
	I hope this is the right address. I ran into Kristian and Monica the other =
day, got Kristian's card, and promptly lost it. I am going solely on my form=
idable memory of the address. Sounds like you guys had a bigger freak show t=
here than we did here. What an incredible story. Hopefully neither of us wil=
l have to go through that again. I'm out of the office here and heading down=
 to Houston to trade gas. It's west basis, so I should be able to draw on my=
 power knowledge a little bit. Things got a little crazy here, will have to =
tell you more over several beers, I think that is the minimum it will take. =
Erica is excited for a change, although Houston is not her first choice, she=
's a trooper and will find fun things to do. How is Sarah doing? I hope she =
and the baby have made it through all the changes. There is a woman here who=
 I think would be interested in coming to London. She is young (only 23) but=
 has raw talent. She started here last summer working in the California book=
=2E Let me know if you could use a hand, as I said, she has raw talent and d=
rive. Thats all from here. Stay in touch and say hello to Sarah.=20
