I worked with someone on a project that APQC did for us, and he is now looki=
ng for a new opportunity (just our of law school). I let him know that Enron=
 doesn't typically hire right out of law school, but was wondering if there =
might be someone he could talk to about "a day in the life of a corporate la=
wyer."  Is there someone in particular who handles recruiting for legal?

Thanks for your help!

Missy
