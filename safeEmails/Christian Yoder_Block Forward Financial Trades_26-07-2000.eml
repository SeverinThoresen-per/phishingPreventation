Legal has been assessing the risks of doing block forward trades as financia=
l=20
and for now, subject to future changes that may be required  as discussions=20
with the CAPX legal experts continue,  we can state the basic rules as=20
follows:

It is okay to do up to 50% of  our Block Forward business as financial.
It is very important to monitor this 50% level very closely and we should no=
t=20
exceed it. We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We=20
should confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records=20
should never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forwar=
d=20
business as financial. =20
One of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there=20
must be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This=20
dumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we=20
communicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we=20
should give our reason.  I'm not sure whether our decision is expressed by=20
phone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change=20
with the PX should get in an expression something like this:  "we would like=
=20
to change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of=20
physical risk will benefit us commercially."  Please be patient with this=20
self serving requirement and do it.=20

 I have not worked out with any of the other back office groups how this new=
=20
practice will be handled. Obviously any changes it will require in=20
scheduling, settlements and accounting need to be dealt with too. Please cal=
l=20
me with any questions.  ----cgy=20
