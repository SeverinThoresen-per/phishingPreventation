EnronOnline started to see message delivery slow down drastically at 8:40am.=
  At 8:50 updates were so slow that all products were suspended from trading=
=2E  At 8:56 we brought the site offline to insure that trading would NOT co=
ntinue, as our traders could not manage their products.

At 9:10 we were able to isolate the issue to a single disk, in a brick of st=
orage, that was responding extremely slowly, but not failing over like it sh=
ould.  We removed the storage from the configuration and brought the databas=
e back online.  Once we verified the database was healthy we brought EOL bac=
k online at approximately 9:28am.  At this point all our users, both interna=
l and external, started logging back in.

The issue was caused by a bug in the firmware on the disk.  The vendor of th=
e disk has already provided us with a patch for this bug.  We will be applyi=
ng this patch to all of our storage, one brick at a time starting this eveni=
ng.

We had to take EOL offline for a second time at 11:17am due to a failure on =
another brick of storage.  This failure was caused while we were verifying t=
he root cause of the issue we experienced earlier.  We brought the site back=
 online at 11:56.  During this outage we verified that there was NO corrupti=
on or loss of data, due to either of the outages.
