Buddy,

Surely you jest!  Oh, don't buy Lucent either.  I think they are preparing
to file Chapter 11.  Yea, I'll bet if I had not let Ma fall out of the truck
she would have really bragged on me.  I know.  Terrible.  I do recall her
spanking me a long time ago!!!  Today is Friday and I am happy.  Hey, what
is getting short mean?  I hear people speaking of this thing all the time
but I don't know.  Dow is kicking tail today.
I saw that mortgage rates rose today.  Did you really lose that much
money???  I would be climbing upon top of my DWS(dow work station) to jump
off.  That's my latest saying.  I am not making new paragraphs just
rambling.  Have a good weekend.

dg

You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma
Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times
if I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was
married with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.

I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short
around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost
$185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy
that makes me.

I'm gonna go pout now.

Later
