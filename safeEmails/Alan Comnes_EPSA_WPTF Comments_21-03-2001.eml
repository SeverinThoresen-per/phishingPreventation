Sue, Joe, Mary:

As you can see from my other email, I took a wack at supplementing the=20
EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional stuff on hyrdro.

I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not=
=20
to include but I would appreciate your feedback too.

Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good.  My only comment is that, beginnign on p.=
=20
3,  EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding. =20
There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical=20
witholding).  If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the=20
market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able=
=20
to economically withold.

Re: WPTF, I am not sure what to say.  I apologize that I had not read=20
carefully before our 1 pm call but the version I reviewed has some issues. I=
=20
just don't think it will be received that well by the FERC staff. Other than=
=20
amplifying the credit issue (probably in there at Sue's request) I am hard=20
pressed to know why Enron would support it seperate from EPSA.=20
