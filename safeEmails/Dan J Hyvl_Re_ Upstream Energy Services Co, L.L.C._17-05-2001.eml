I agree with the corrected amount.  Thank you for bringing that to my=20
attention. Spell check doesn't work on numbers or capitals. =20

There appears to be a typo in the amount due HPL from Upstream.  It should b=
e=20
$238,508.61.  I will withhold this amount on the 25th.

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL=
=20
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) and woul=
d=20
it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment bein=
g=20
sent to Upstream.  The documentation that has been provided to me shows that=
=20
this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997=20
payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a=
=20
nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the=20
wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties=20
that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information=20
provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the=20
reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that=
=20
has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its=20
responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect=20
the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kell=
y=20
written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete=20
because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and=20
volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the=20
confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes=20
should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did=20
not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was=20
the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated=20
that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue=20
should be resolved through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum=
=20
of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) from the next payment to be made to=20
Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL=20
needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim=20
for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to=20
Upstream.
