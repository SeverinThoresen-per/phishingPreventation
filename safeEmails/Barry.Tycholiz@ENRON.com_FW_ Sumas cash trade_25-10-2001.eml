Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediate=
d between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is =
Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you=
 are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you woul=
d like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell th=
em gas at Sumas DI.

Chris
