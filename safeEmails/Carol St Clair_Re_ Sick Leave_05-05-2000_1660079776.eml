Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the=

baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor=20
need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already=20
starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return=20
to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks=
