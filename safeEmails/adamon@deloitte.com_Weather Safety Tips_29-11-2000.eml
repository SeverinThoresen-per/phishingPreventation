     Weather Safety Tips

     Roadways can often become icy without warning, presenting serious
     hazards to motorists, so you should keep snow chains on your tires at
     all times.

     Flash flooding can be a serious threat during heavy thunderstorms; if
     you are at any time abruptly swept away by a raging stream or river,
     be prepared to take emergency action.

     If your community is threatened by a tornado, close all doors and
     windows, caulk them shut, then twitch and quiver fiercely as you hope
     to God you make it out of this thing alive.

     When driving through heavy rain, motorists should accelerate
     significantly to remove water from their windshield as fast as
     possible.

     Never attempt to drive through standing water if it is deeper than
     your car.

     Do not temp fate by golfing during a thunderstorm; in 1998 alone, over
     14,000 golfers completely fucked up their favorite golf shoes by
     walking on saturated greens, and another 9,200 were injured by flying
     clubs whose grips had become unexpectedly slippery.

     Sandstorms can occur without warning in desert climates, and present
     serious blinding and choking hazards to people caught in them. If you
     find yourself caught in a sandstorm, you should immediately reconsider
     what hell your were doing wandering through the goddamn desert in the
     first place.

     While not necessarily weather phenomena, earthquakes can be powerful
     and devastating. If you fear you might be living in an
     earthquake-prone region, consider moving to less threatened locations,
     such as Antarctica or the moon.
