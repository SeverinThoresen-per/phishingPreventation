Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North Ame=
rica under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these tra=
nsactions have been or will be settled financially, however these transactio=
ns could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the transaction cha=
nges as a result of a few variables, including the price,day of cash settlem=
ent, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which would then automatic=
ally convert the fixed price portion to 100% load factor and settlement woul=
d be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what physically flowed.=20

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.  =20

Barry  Tycholiz
Vice President, Enron North America
