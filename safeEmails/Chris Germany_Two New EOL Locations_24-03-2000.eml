Subject: Two New EOL Locations

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having=20
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (i=
f=20
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE=20
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will=
=20
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   Ther=
e=20
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to thes=
e=20
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4=20
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission=20
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG =20
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is=20
304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also=20
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as=20
possible.

If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN=
=20
ADVANCE!!!!!!=20

Victor,
Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company=
=20
are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.
Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner,=
=20
in our group, will coordinate adding these locations
for EOL trading.
Thanks!

Subject: two new locations

Hey Jennifer,  How are you?

We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new=20
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and=20
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG=20
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they=20
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers=
=20
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new=20
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the=20
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being=20
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading=20
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services=20
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually startin=
g=20
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs=20
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if yo=
u=20
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!
