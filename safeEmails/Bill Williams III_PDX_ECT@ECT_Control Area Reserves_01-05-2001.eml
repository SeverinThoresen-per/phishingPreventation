Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbo=
r and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from=
 BPA.=20

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA =
is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT=
 of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and ma=
ke the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Gr=
ays unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top o=
f the hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bot=
tom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would =
need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all h=
ours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from P=
ACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the monthl=
y sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The Assig=
nment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per hour v=
s the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can save som=
e money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp =
to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with =
reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays=
 with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the=
 schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This=
 service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service=
 applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

Les
