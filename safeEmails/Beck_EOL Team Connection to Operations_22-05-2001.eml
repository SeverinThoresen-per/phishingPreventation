I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you =
to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that I=
 don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously played =
by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore th=
e importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my opera=
tions team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my ris=
k and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an i=
mpact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in pass=
ing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and =
power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although J=
ennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on mate=
rnity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on=
 the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita direct=
ly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and en=
couragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  -=
