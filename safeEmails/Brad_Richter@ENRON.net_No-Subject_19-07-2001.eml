Thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for EnronOnline.  =
As far as I'm concerned, the platform we have is astonishing, and I agree th=
at the more we lengthen our lead over the competition (in both trading and t=
echnology) the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales.=
  To that end, Jay and I will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding =
up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and re=
venue.  Also, we'll get Kal focused on periodic face-lifts of the GUI.  Then=
 we will devote Origination attention to third party sales which will valida=
te our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable wo=
rth to Enron.  If resources become constrained, it will simply mean that we =
are finding traction in the right places.

Yes, I am excited about this job, and yes, I want to be in the hot seat you =
and Greg are describing.  I hope I can run ideas past you from time to time =
and I trust you will let me know when you have comments or concerns.

Thanks,
Brad
