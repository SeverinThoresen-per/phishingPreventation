Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcoun=
t addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with y=
ou on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if =
any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best =
in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions fo=
r EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago. =20

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details a=
vailable tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's=
 team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM En=
hancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other =
that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the c=
ost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other =
commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings fr=
om these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight. =20

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and =
you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from=
 other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have y=
our final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position =
changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who=
 they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT p=
rojects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Op=
erations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is n=
o longer required - we need to just get back to where we were. =20

Thanks

Louise

=46rom our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the busi=
ness, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels),=
 our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total=20
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather p=
ositions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estima=
te and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performe=
rs across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this we=
ekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could pote=
ntially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for=
 those two business units. =20

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, =
which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and a=
ny systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate al=
so did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that m=
ay result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter. =
=20

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompa=
tible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.=
