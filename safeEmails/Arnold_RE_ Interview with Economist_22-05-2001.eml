John --=20

I don't think we've met, but I'm Vance Meyer, a media relations director for=
 Enron.  Tomorrow, Jeff Skilling and some other key players are interviewing=
 for a story on eCommerce with Vijay Vaitheeswaran, a reporter with the Econ=
omist.  Vijay this morning asked if you would be available as well.  I can s=
end you more detail once I have your availability.  Understanding your limit=
ed time during trading hours, do you have a late afternoon availability?  If=
 not, would you rather do it in the late morning?

If you can and will do the interview, please let me know.

Thanks

Vance Meyer
