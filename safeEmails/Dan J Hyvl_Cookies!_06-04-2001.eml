 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it w=
as
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.=3D Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud=
=2E
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refundi=
ng
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and ge=
t=20
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....
