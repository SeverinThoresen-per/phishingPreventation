        May 28, 2001  TIME Magazine Topping Out In Houston Again  BY CATHY B=
OOTH THOMAS/DALLAS  Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be powerle=
ss and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to the =
oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in "bidness." The energy giants in =
Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction plans. N=
ot since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Johnson a=
nd I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much construction =
activity by the energy sector.  Leading the parade, ironically, is Enron, an=
 old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trading firm =
dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In fact, its n=
ew 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronted by a seve=
n-story "podium"--or shorter building--to house what Enron is calling the la=
rgest commodities-trading environment in the world.  This environment, sprea=
d over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become home this Aug=
ust to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Old World (crude =
oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emission credits and de=
rivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are even moving from =
their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they can peer down into t=
he pit.  When the bigger 40-story structure is finished in December, Enron's=
 will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston since 1987--to be foll=
owed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp., the nation's leadi=
ng independent-power company, based in California, will move into a new 32-s=
tory high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun off this month from its =
Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated electricity market, has s=
igned on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.  What's fueling the high-rise=
 fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's first-quarter revenues were up 281%, =
while Calpine's revenues and net income were each up more than 400%--even wi=
th California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the company more than $300 milli=
on.  After a decade of contraction in the business, with companies having sh=
ut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, deregulation and new marketing stra=
tegies are sparking Houston's renaissance. "Enron is a leading example of th=
e new energy industry. Ten years ago, there were no trading floors," points =
out Stephen Brown, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas.=
 Both Calpine and Reliant will also have trading operations in their new off=
ices.  Though Houston no longer relies so heavily on the energy business (do=
wn to 48% of the local economy from 82% in 1982) the turnaround sure feels g=
ood after the city lost more than 15,000 energy-sector jobs two years ago, s=
ays Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the =
University of Houston. It has gained those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith:=
 "The current boom is what's keeping Houston afloat while the rest of the co=
untry is suffering."  None of this matters to real Houston lovers, of course=
=2E They're just interested in bragging rights. After a bad decade, they're =
beginning to sound like the biggest and the best in Texas again. "Boomlet?" =
says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman at Enron. "It's more than a mini-boom. It's=
 a boom."         =09

BOMBAY, India (AP) - The Indian subsidiary of American power concern Enron C=

pply dispute.=20
"We look forward to hearing the proposed solutions ... particularly relating=
 to creditworthy purchases for the power," said a statement from Dabhol Powe=

The statement comes two days after the company issued a preliminary notice t=

d stop supplying electricity if the government company continued to default =
on payments.=20
Representatives from Houston-based Enron will meet Wednesday with officials =
from the utility, the federal government and Maharashtra, the western Indian=
 state where the project is located.=20
The MSEB has denied it defaulted on paying electricity bills to the power co=
mpany that is setting up a $3 billion project in Maharashtra state. MSEB off=
icials said overdue December and January bills of $48 million should be offs=
et against a fine of $85.31 million it imposed on Enron for not supplying po=
wer during the period. Enron disputes the fine.=20
Politicians in Maharashtra say the cost of Dabhol power is too high and have=
 called for renegotiating the tariff. Others have suggested selling power to=
 nearby power-hungry states.=20
Politicians complain Dabhol's costs have averaged more than 4 rupees (11 cen=

The controversy erupted last year when prices shot up to 7 rupees (15 cents)=

INDIA: WRAPUP 1-Indian state questions power deals, cites Enron.

BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - India's ambitious plans to throw open its cash-st=
rapped power sector to the private sector, already wracked by controversy in=
volving Enron , received a further setback after Karnataka state said it wou=
ld reopen sealed deals with 11 power firms.=20
The technology-friendly southern state of Karnataka said late on Monday that=
 it was re-opening power deals with 11 private sector firms which together w=
ere due to meet half the state's demand over the next 10 years.
"Enron is a lesson for all of us. Now, it (electricity) cannot be at any cos=
t," V.P. Baligar, chairman and managing director, Karnataka State Power Tran=
smission Corp (KPTCL), the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reuters =
in an interview late on Monday.=20
The 11 power projects are based on the Enron model and involve a total of 2,=
000 megawatts (MW). None of the 11 projects have started generation.=20
Analysts fear that Karnataka's move, coming amidst the raging controversy ov=
er Enron's giant power project, will scare away badly needed private investm=
ent from the country's inefficient power sector.=20
India needs to add 100,000 MW of power over the next 10-15 years to meet gro=
wing demand and is hoping to get this through investment from private and fo=
reign companies.=20
But investment has been hampered by a slow-moving bureaucracy, legal hassles=
 and loss-making utilities who are frequently unable to pay for the power pu=
rchased.=20
ENRON IMBROGLIO=20
Last week, Enron's Dabhol Power Company moved to break a contract to sell po=
wer to Maharashtra state, peeved over payment defaults by the state utility =
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). This is widely seen as leading t=
o a pull out.=20
MSEB and Dabhol have been at loggerheads for over six months over payments d=
ue to DPC by the state utility. The project has been marred by controversy s=
ince its inception in 1991, with critics charging that it was charging too m=
uch for the power it produced.=20
MSEB, which DPC says owes it $48 million, is planning to retaliate by slappi=
ng a penalty of 4.0 billion rupees ($85.2 million) on DPC for failing to ram=
p up capacity.=20
"We will issue the penalty as soon as the bill for May is received," the off=
icial, who did not want to be quoted, told Reuters on Tuesday.=20
MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying =
its plant could not be ramped upto full capacity within three hours from a c=
old start. DPC officials refused to comment on the issue.=20
The Enron project was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old refor=
m programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling.=20
The project involves the setting up of a 2,184 MW power project costing $2.9=
 billion in two phases. The first, of 740 MW, is up and running while the se=
cond, of 1,444 MW, is due to be commissioned next month.=20

Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters

HOUSTON (AP) - Executives of Enron Corp. say they are withdrawing from a lar=
ge natural gas project off Qatar, partly because the venture doesn't fit wit=
h the energy company's focus.=20
Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with El=
f, a subsidiary of France's Total Fina, and the United Arab Emirates Offsets=
 Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Field=
=2E
But the company pulled out, believing there are better places to invest its =
money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London.=20
He said the project doesn't fit with Enron's current focus of emphasizing bu=
sinesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those fo=
r natural gas and electricity and broadband.=20
Those involved with the project said last year it could end up requiring inv=
estments of up to dlrs 10 billion over six or seven years.=20
Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project =
to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it h=
ad started negotiating with other international players to become stakeholde=
rs.=20
With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent =
of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released.=20
Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates O=
ffsets Group that were "in line with our core business activities."=20
M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, sai=
d Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international asset=
s that generate low returns.

GERMANY: Enron says Lampertheim hub attracting interest.

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUESSELDORF, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. trader Enron said on tuesday there was =
growing support for the south west German Lampterheim gas hub it had been ac=
tively promoting since early April.=20
"Liquidity is growing slowly, it is not (Belgian hub) Zeebrugge, but custome=
rs are posting orders and are coming forward with surplus amounts," sales ch=
ief Helge-Juergen Beil of the company's German division in Frankfurt told Re=
uters during a Euroforum industry conference.
"Our main strength is that we both sell and buy for various periods."=20
Beil said a number of deals had been done, but would not quantify them.=20
Enron on its trading platform enrononline.com currently quotes Lampertheim g=
as sales and purchases in parcels of 20 megawatt hours in euros for the spot=
 market and the year ahead.=20
The town, near Heidelberg on the border of the Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg =
states, complements border hubs such as Bunde-Oude, Aachen, Baumgarten, Waid=
haus and Oberkappel.=20
Beil also said Enron was supplying eight local and regional utilities and in=
dustrial gas customers in central and southern Germany with a total four ter=
awatt hours of annual demand.=20
Enron's share of total requirements in each case varied between 20 and 94 pe=
rcent of their annual purchases.=20
He said non-discriminatory access to the German pipeline grid had not been a=
chieved by newcomers to the market.=20
In order to help create fair rules for access and their montoring, Enron, li=
ke other newcomers, was demanding a state-installed arbiter to supervise the=
 liberalisation process.=20
Other speakers at the conference said the success of newcomers was still ham=
pered by the long distribution chain and an enforced need for hourly, rather=
 than longer term, balancing, which could cause exorbitant penalties payable=
 to incumbents.=20
But some gas grid owners had turned out to be co-operative, customers were q=
ueueing up, and there were prospects that existing surplus gas volumes from =
international take-or-pay contracts could be freed up and eventually traded.
