The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that=
=20
someone much more important may bump us.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for=20
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is=
=20
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the=20
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  Th=
e=20
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the=20
withdrawals.

Which brings up the following issues;
 *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES=20
at the storage facility.
  Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for=20
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.

 * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?

 * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will=
=20
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

Thanks
