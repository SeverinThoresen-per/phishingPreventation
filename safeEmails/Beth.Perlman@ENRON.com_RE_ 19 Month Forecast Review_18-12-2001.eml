We want to cancel the Netegrity contract and are looking at the Interwoven l=
icenses to see if we can cancel them as well.

Thanks,
Beth

Please see the attached file for your respective area (by your last name) an=
d make sure you're comfortable with your latest forecast numbers (excluding =
salaries).  I have added a Capex section for any groups that will plan on sp=
ending capital dollars.  Please be as detailed as possible. =20

Assume forecast dollars are only reflective of the estate.  For those ENW gr=
oups likely to have resources moving to NETCo, please include those forecast=
 dollars in the "NETCo" tab.  E.g., If we need a total picture of Jenny's sp=
end, we'll add the "Rub" tab (estate) with the "NETCo" tab Jenny submits. =20

Jenny/Beth P.,
A license / maintenance renewal schedule was obtained from GSS.  We put toge=
ther a summary tab called "Lic-Main Breakout".  These dollars are reflected =
in your respective forecasts.  Please review for completeness and ensure we =
are not double counting any dollars already included by your folks.

Please confirm your respective numbers and reflect any changes you know of b=
y end of day today. =20

Thanks,
Mike
