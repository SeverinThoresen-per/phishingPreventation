Hi!

         How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a=20
bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused=20
several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone=20
with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos an=
d=20
I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.0=
0=20
to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off=20
Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I=20
finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and=20
my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (t=
o=20
nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room -=20
it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Do=
n=20
told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn=
=20
has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are=20
not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better=
=20
go.  Love you and take care of yourself.
