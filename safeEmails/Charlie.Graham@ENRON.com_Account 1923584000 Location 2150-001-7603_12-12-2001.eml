Mr. Roger Wick


Midland Power

As we discussed this morning, even though Northern Natural Gas is not a part=
y to the subject ENA/Midland contract, we would be adversely affected should=
 the power service at that location be shut off.  I appreciate your agreeing=
 to notify me (as a courtesy) in advance (402) 398-7061 of any such cessatio=
n of service prior to it occurring.

In answer to your specific question, the appropriate party to contact who re=
presents ENA is Mark Knippa, who can be reached at (713) 853-3463.  Only he =
or whomever he directs you to can speak for ENA.

I understand you just received several documents from ENA and wish to review=
 them before commenting further regarding what Midlands future actions might=
 be.  I also understood you to say that in any event you would not discontin=
ue service over the weekend and not without 24 hours notice so that someone =
could meet your folks at the site.

Contacts of value to you might be:

ENA Mark Knippa  (713) 853-3463
