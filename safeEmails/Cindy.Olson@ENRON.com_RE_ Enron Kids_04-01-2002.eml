I previously worked for Enron and have found employment elsewhere.  I really=
 would like to put my son back into Enron Kids starting Monday, but I cannot=
 afford $800 a month.  Do you know if the rates will be lowered?  I am a sin=
gle mother and can only afford $650 - $680 a month.  Could you please get ba=
ck with me as soon as possible?  I need to know if I am going to have to put=
 him in another daycare. =20
Thank you for your consideration.
