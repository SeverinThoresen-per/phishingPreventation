Sally,

Sorry for not letting you know what was going on sooner.  I contanted your=20
assistant last Friday but she was walking out the door so I told her that I=20
would call and make an appointment on Monday.  In the meantime, I threw away=
=20
her name and cannot for the life of me remember.  I have been pretty busy th=
e=20
last couple of days so I do apologize for the delay.  Please e-mail me back.

Thanks

Ashley=20
