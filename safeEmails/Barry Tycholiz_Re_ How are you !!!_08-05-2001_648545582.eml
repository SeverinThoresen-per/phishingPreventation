Jim, good to hear from you.  Glad to hear that everything is going OK.  My t=
ransition down to Houston has all in all gone pretty good.  We settled in pr=
etty quick at home and Kim is being quite a trooper regarding her home life =
although I know she misses outside interaction. She may be able to work soon=
 so this should help keep her busy.=20

Work has been exiting, the West US markets have provided good opportunities =
to me and I am slowly making my way to meet the customers.  I could easily s=
pend every day on the road.=20

I have loved the winter.. hilight has to be no snow to shovell... but I will=
 pay the price for the summer because you can't do anything when it is a 100=
 degrees. =20

Better run,.... drop me a line sometime... and if you are ever getting your =
way down this way, call first, we will get together.

BT=20
