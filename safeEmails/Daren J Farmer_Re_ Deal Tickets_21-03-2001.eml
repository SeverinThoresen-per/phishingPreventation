I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal number=
s=20
you listed are WRONG. =20

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to=20
POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.
