Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third=20
Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did=20
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for=
=20
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again=20
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party=20
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraint=
s.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your=20
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel=
=20
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what=20
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on=20
the worksheet.

So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

Comments?
