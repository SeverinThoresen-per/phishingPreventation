Hi Ina,=20
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messag=
ing software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are att=
ending at 12.30pm.=20
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the =
PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other tr=
aders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he=
 would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 2=
2C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these tim=
es, let me know and I will sort out a location.=20
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.=20
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm.=20
Many thanks
