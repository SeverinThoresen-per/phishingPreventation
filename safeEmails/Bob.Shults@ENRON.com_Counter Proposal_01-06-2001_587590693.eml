Don,

Concerning your request for a discounted rate on Broker Client I offer up th=
e following:

$200 K if signed by COB 6/8
$225 K if signed by COB 6/15
$250 K if signed after 6/15

Just to let you know we have seen significant activity on the Broker Client =
since its implementation.  In addition we have experienced a steep growth cu=
rve on the number of transactions.  I believe that many of the concerns by y=
our customers are going away as this tool has become a common practice in th=
e industry. =20

You can find Mark Greenbergs email address above.  Please have your attorney=
 deal directly with mark on the Agreement.  Thanks
