Rick Carson from RAC is currently reviewing all of the interests/assets we h=
ave which have been written to zero over the last few years and have essenti=
ally disappeared from any form of reporting - a prime example of these would=
 be MidWest Gas Storage which recently emerged as something of an issue.

Rick believes that there are approximately 75 - 100 of these interests/asset=
s for review and he is preparing a list in the next week or so.  When this l=
ist is pulled together reponsibility for all of them will fall under Dick Ly=
decker, this will therefore include Mid West Gas Storage.  Let's hope Dick c=
an get something from our 25% overriding interest.  Dick will be responsible=
 for reviewing this portfolio, managing the risks and ensuring we maximise a=
ll upsides.

Louise
