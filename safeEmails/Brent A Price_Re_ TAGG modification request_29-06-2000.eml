Souad,

There are expiration dates for swaptions/options on the "Detail" button in=20
TAGG Deal Capture.  Let's
do the following.  Go into TAGG Deal Capture and check to make sure these=20
dates are valid for swaptions/options.

We will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are =20
expiring.

Thanks, Ron

Souad,

We can implement this - the question is "when". As I indicated to Jeff, we=20
are currently working on ClickPaper
but we will work on whatever is a higher priority from Enron's point of view=

Thanks, Ron

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more=20
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into =
a=20
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an=20
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a=
=20
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In=20
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a=20
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later=20
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the=20
expiration date becomes current). =20

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of=20
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue=20
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed an=
d=20
your feedback is appreciated. =20

Thanks.=20


I work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me=
=20
if you have any questions or suggestions (X37580).=20
