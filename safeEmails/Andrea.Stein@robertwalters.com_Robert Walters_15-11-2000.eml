Hi Larry,
This is Andrea Stein from Robert Walters Assoc. As I said in our
conversation, I am working on a search for a corporate finance position in a
large power and energy firm in the Mid Atlantic region. It is a corporate
finance function at a manager level and some of the general responsibilities
include interest and foreign exchange risk management, long-term cash
forecasting and capital budgeting, long-term debt and equity financing, and
market analysis. I was hoping you would be able to point me in the right
direction for this search, please feel to contact me if you have any
questions, and to give my information for referrals.
Thank you very much,



Andrea Stein
