Mr. Lay:
=20
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my he=
art, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do, =
on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  I j=
oined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public U=
tilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. =
I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders o=
f magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help =
but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and=
 satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the=
 confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business. =
 I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it doe=
s not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame ma=
y soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at=
 Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in t=
he United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many ot=
hers, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with=
 mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organi=
sm like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with y=
ou as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank y=
ou for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.  I will alway=
s be proud to have worked under your direction and leadership.
=20
Best Regards,
=20
Andrew Kosnaski
