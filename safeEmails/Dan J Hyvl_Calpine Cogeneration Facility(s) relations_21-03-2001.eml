Texas City Facility -
 The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be=20
strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron=
=20
and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,00=
0=20
MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was i=
n=20
place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to=20
that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply=20
under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the=20
facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were=20
terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility=20
although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the=20
Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in=20
place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity=20
obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall i=
n=20
volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has=
=20
shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts=20
invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power=20
purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchas=
e=20
of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's nex=
t=20
day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of =20
creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These=
=20
notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has=20
provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force=20
majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state=20
that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking=20
valves, etc.

Clear Lake Facility -
 The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to=20
deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the=20
base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was=20
negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and=20
delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is=20
required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes=20
supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be=20
amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchase=
r=20
cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment=20
allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery=20
points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force=20
majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility=20
which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S=20
pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacit=
y=20
to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not. =20
