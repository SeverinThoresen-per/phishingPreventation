Thanks for all you have done and for your continued efforts to see us throug=
h this difficulty.  I can not begin to imagine the weight of your burden, bu=
t please know that I and I am sure most employees are behind you 100% and ap=
preciate all you have done and are doing.  I know you will see us through th=
is and am delighted you are there to lead the endeavor.

Are you assuming more responsibility for our low stock price than you should=
?  Doesn't Ben Graham's Mister Market deserve most of the credit for our rec=
ent price swings?  I believe strongly in free markets.  However, for them to=
 work there must be intelligent, well informed buyers and intelligent, well =
informed sellers operating in good faith.  I am not convinced the U.S stock =
market has seen many of either over the last three to five years!  My only h=
ope is that the speculators, gamblers, short sellers, etc. all loose their s=
hirts and that Mr. Market finally gets his courage screwed to the hitching p=
ost!

Just get us through the exposures we have at our current market cap. and we =
will be in great shape a few years from now. =20

Thanks again and best wishes.
