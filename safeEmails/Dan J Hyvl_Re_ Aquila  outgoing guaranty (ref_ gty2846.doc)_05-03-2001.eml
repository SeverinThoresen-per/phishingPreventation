Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement=
=20
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation=
=20
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security=20
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please=20
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation fo=
r=20
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put=20
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty=20
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL.=20

Thank you,

Russell
