A man flying in a hot air balloon realised that he was lost. He reduced heig=
ht and spotted a man below. He shouted down: 'Can you help me? I promised to=
 meet my friend half an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.' The passer-b=
y shouted 'You are in a hot air balloon hovering 30 feet above a field. The =
field is located at 40 to 41 degrees latitude and 59 to 60 degrees longitude=
'. The balloonist thought for a few moments and replied: 'You must work in r=
isk management.' 'Remarkable,' said the passer-by. 'How did you work that ou=
t?' 'Well,' answered the balloonist, 'everything you've told me is undoubted=
ly correct. However, I haven't the slightest clue what to make of it and the=
 fact is that I'm still lost.' The passer-by gave him a knowing look and rep=
lied: 'Why didn't you tell me you were a trader?' The balloonist looked amaz=
ed and said: ' How did you work that out?' 'Simple,' replied the passer-by. =
'You don't know where you are or where you're going. You've made a promise t=
hat you've no idea how to keep and expected me to solve the problem. Having =
done as you asked, you're in exactly the same situation as you were before w=
e met, but now, somehow, the whole thing's my fault.'=20
