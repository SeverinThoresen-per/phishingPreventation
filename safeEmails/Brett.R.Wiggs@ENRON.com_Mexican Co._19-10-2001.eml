Louise:

Regarding the potential for Enron to work on another Vitro type project, the=
 attached email gives the name of the company with whom we were discussing t=
he turbine sale.  We are trying to find out more information on the project =
and will forward that to you as we receive it.  If you would like me to deal=
 with someone directly in Mexico, please let me know who that should be.  We=
 are also working with Maria Elena Garcia to develop potential customers in =
Mexico for a straight turbine sale.  She has indicated that she believes the=
re may be some additional potential for cogen applications with these units.

Thanks,
Brett

Brett,

The name of the Mexican company is Energia Industrial Rio Colorado SA de CV.=
 The company is located in the Mexican State of Sonora (Mexico), near to the=
 US border. The project was originally projected to deliver power inside the=
 fence (co-generation) and to the US (California).

I left a voice mail with the broker. I'll keep you updated on any news I may=
 have.

Diego
