The location is EB3269.  Thank you.

This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for=
 any inconvenience.

Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would hav=
e implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing =
warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of=
 the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we =
cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to m=
ake them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be=
 beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would h=
ave the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the tra=
de date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are =
in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins t=
o question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To d=
ate the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9=
/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to disp=
lay for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not jus=
t for a different month?

Thank you in advance.
