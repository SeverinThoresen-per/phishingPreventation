I gather you heard about 6 to 7 for Cornhusker for this quarter.  About 4 in=
 cash and about 2 in reval accretion.

East Coast s/b essentially flat.  Cash in and lower reval netting.

Any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estim=
ate or actual from me.  We do need to discuss ECP debt today if you're avail=
able.
