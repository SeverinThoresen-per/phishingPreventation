Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews se=
veral months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determi=
ne the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomod=
ate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from T=
ed Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer inte=
rns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with Lexi Elliot (one o=
f the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matche=
d the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could he=
lp in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.  My last conversati=
on with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incom=
ing interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.  --Sally=20

Hi Sally,
I just wanted to touch base and see if you know of anyone who has an opening=
 in their dept for a summer student.  Debbie Wang is a third year marketing =
major and is interested in working at Enron.  She is the daughter of an I/T =
developer which I mentioned to you previously (Richard Wang).  I would appre=
ciate any thoughts...

Thanks,
Avril
