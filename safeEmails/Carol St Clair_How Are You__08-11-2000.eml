Susan:
I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow=20
got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over th=
e=20
past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your=20
impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for=20
me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great=
=20
experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I=
=20
miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we=20
have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday=20
I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forwar=
d=20
to hearing from you.

Carol
