 RAC if a number of us could break away for at least a few minutes to partic=
ipate in this kick-off to the United Way Campaign.

	For the 3AC crowd, a group will be meeting at the elevators on 3AC14 to wal=
k over to the Crown Plaza at 3:20pm.  I encourage the EB folks to the do the=
 same on EB28.
