Ken and Mark,

Richard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read an article about=20
Regenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed in the UK, and=
=20
wanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this technology.  I=20
am a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress of Regenesy=
s=20
since it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched it with=
=20
interest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's power=20
market.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the=20
preliminary analysis.

Below is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology=20
and our response going forward.

Technology Summary
large-scale battery system using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that ar=
e=20
separated by an ion exchange membrane
current generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh per da=
y)
response time within 20 milliseconds
it can release full power within a few seconds thereby yielding brief=20
capacity of up to 500 MW
$1500 / kW capital costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx.=
=20
$750 / kW=20
18 month build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1=20
hectare (50 m x 60 m)


Latest Developments
Innogy announced last month that it will proceed with it's first Regenesys=20
plant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK
Tennessee Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innog=
y=20
on the Regenesys technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit=20
there yet

Our Cynical Point of View
Innogy have got to go a long way before they can make this technology=20
commercially successful
Our initial analysis shows that based on the peak/off-peak spreads they need=
=20
to achieve capital costs less than $600 / kW to be successful - we have not=20
seen evidence that this can be achieved
Innogy have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the=20
forthcoming spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatatio=
n
There has been a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the=
=20
specifications of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved=20
since we first looked at this in July 1999
Innogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage for peak/off-peak=20
arbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having large-scale=20
diesel standby generation

On the Brighter Side
The real potential for this technology could be in supporting grid systems=20
It has good black start and frequency response capabilities

Way Forward
We are evaluating the commercial attraction of the black start and frequency=
=20
response characteristics with respect to our interests in the UK
I will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating any further=20
potential in the US

Please let me know if you would like any further details on the above.

Regards,

Chris
