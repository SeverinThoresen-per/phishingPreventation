Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT=
=20
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this=20
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a=20
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my=20
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be abl=
e=20
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what=
=20
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If=
=20
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks=20
again for taking the time to help me with this issue. =20
Ben
