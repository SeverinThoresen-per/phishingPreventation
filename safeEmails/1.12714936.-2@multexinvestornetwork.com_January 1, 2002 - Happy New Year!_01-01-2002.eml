1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The decade ahead for e-business
Sell-side solutions may be the wave of the near-term future

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the Line56 conference held recently in New York, one of the=20
most upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came from=20
Tom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, and=20
former CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s.

Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade,=20
Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of=20
1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of a=20
recession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deployment=20
of new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.

Broadband goes mainstream
That sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screaming=20
through fat pipes

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Who needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour?=20
That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business models=20
that delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to find=20
that most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial-
up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has been=20
so slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before ever=20
garnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation,=20
have come and gone.

But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise of=20
broadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetration=20
rates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary to=20
make broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S.=20
households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of=20
all households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group.=20
That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago.=20
