Subject: downtime request


The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system
'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need
to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to
perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected:

eqtprod
dcfprod
popprod
trdprod
semprod
sitprod2
infprd53

Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.
