Brad,

Here is the link to the map for TCO.  This is the first "edition" so I'll le=
t you know as updates occur.  Give me your opinions on where you want it to =
go from here. My first step would be to get more numbers for each point out =
there.  Yesterday's data and a change value perhaps.

Let me know.
