Subject:	Mid/Back office objectives

A near term goal for mid/back office commercialization is as follows:

First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that c=
an be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces.  In o=
ther words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we p=
ut it at Enron.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power schedulin=
g at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) a=
nd create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works.

Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a syste=
ms perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)?

Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other=
 parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP =
system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical settle=
ments, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc.  =
All the linkages.

Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines pa=
yments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies a=
s well.

Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.

Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeti=
ng).

Finally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.

I know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time =
schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the follow=
ing format:

A draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a cle=
ar picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a r=
ecommendation on how Enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger a=
s well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in Enron and how=
 those functions work with ProcessCo.

Sheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump ar=
e now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back off=
ice experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom=
 comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.

Let's discuss Monday.

Thanks.
