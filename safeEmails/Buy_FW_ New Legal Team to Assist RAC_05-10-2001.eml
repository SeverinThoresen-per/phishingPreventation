ssed, defaults, and credit watch cases in Metals and I can add value to the =
group.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's =
Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, w=
hich will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Pow=
er Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial=
 Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retai=
l) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus=
 on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterpar=
ties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standa=
rdizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group hav=
e been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader p=
erspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group i=
n addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in co=
njunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Manage=
ment group.   =20

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.
