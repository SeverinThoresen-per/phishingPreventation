Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SL=
A settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wed. With Mar=
y Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring s=
tranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay. =
After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any chang=
es.=20

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to ha=
ve presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance from w=
hat we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capa=
city at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will review with marketi=
ng and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious to he=
ar how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of This em=
ail.

Thanks Lynn
