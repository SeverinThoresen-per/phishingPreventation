All,

I've entered an annuity for October and November Pilot Power scheduling fee,=
 for the November Hanson Cement scheduling fee, and the book-to-book transfe=
r between West Services and Short Term California to split the scheduling fe=
e.  Currently, the fee for Pilot Power is $7,500 per month ($2,500 per load =
zone scheduled, SCE1, SDG1, and PGE3), and the scheduling fee for Hanson is =
$2,500.  The Enpower deal #'s are 855213, 855309, and 855318.

Please take a few moments to review these annuities.  Going forward, West Se=
rvices will enter these annuities at the first of every month for the month =
ahead.

Thanks,
