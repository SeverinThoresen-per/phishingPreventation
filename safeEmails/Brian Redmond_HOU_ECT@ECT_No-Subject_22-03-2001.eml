Max:

I would like to organize a Vitro project review meeting during the next seve=
ral weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation meas=
ures we taking.    The objective of the meeting is to ensure all related Enr=
on entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity t=
o ask questions.  This will reduce the chance that we will run into objectio=
ns down the road on "technical risks" as we begin to ramp up our capital com=
mitments.  We had a similar meeting with the Electrobolt team in Enron S. Am=
erica, that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives.

Do you have a project presentation that you (and/or the lead developer) coul=
d discuss with the above team?  We could do it by phone - or better yet - th=
e next time you are in Houston.  As many of the technical risk issues are al=
so tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas a=
s well (e.g., commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical de=
sign and implementation strategy).

I don't mean to be sticking my nose into your deal, other than to ensure tha=
t everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implement=
ed successfully.

Let me know as to your availability,
Brian
