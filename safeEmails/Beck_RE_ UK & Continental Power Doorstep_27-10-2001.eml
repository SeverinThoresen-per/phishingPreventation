In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep rev=
iews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we =
were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the cont=
inuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort i=
s valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort conti=
nues. =20

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingnes=
s of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11=
th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the plann=
ed 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals bus=
iness and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Cau=
sey for completion in the 4th quarter.  =20

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on O=
ctober 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the =
additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary=
 redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quart=
er plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your co=
ncerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there i=
s still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work cr=
eatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and min=
imize both travel and time involved.  -Sally=20

The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.

I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I =
certainly do not want other things to suffer.

Thanks

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of P=
ower and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a=
 little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the G=
as door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first=
 thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been=
 various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being =
asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Pau=
l Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to ge=
t him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and whi=
ch by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid dupli=
cation. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced=
 capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analys=
is work etc.

We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex deri=
vatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If ye=
s, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy=
 directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?

Thanks,
Stacey

erivatives group which is run totally separately in both personnel and risk =
terms ?

Thanks
