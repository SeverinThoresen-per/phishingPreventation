Vince-

I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.

The "no arbitrage" condition equates trading margins across the country.=20
Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply i=
s=20
almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost=20
completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call=20
option.

The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing=
=20
gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas=20
from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are=20
the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for=20
transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and=20
the valuations of the storage option.

There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork.=20
They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short=20
time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability=20
mentioned above, or point-estimates ("calibrations") using only today's data=
=20
based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes wit=
h=20
the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price=20
versus capacity similarly, "competing" for outflows.

I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at you=
r=20
earliest convenience.

Clayton
