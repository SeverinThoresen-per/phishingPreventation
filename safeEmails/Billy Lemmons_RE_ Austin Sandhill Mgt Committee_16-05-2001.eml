The management committee meetings are held whenever necessary approximately=20

issues that need to be cleaned up such as the plant's construction delay (wa=

June.  Also, I think adding capacity to the demineralization plant is a=20
"no-brainer" to enable us to run the plant at full on the weekends.

Kevin/Dave if you would like to call Andy Ramirez his number is (512)=20
