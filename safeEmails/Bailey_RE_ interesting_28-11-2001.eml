Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo

HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subj=
ect of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trade=
r.

The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms.

"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston," said Ho=
ward Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest wit=
h about 240 lawyers in Houston.

Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. W=
ith about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have be=
en the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle.

Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now =
set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted fu=
rther, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to f=
ace possible bankruptcy.

Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of=
 lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will=
 hold on tightly to its talent.

"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more stea=
dy state. There's a lot of legal work to go through," said Joel Swanson, a s=
enior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston.

In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just=
 about every large firm in Houston over the last few years.
