Anne,

I received your voice mail. We are working with each vendor to assign the co=
ntracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that cont=
ent is available on relaunch of the system.

Affected contracts are:

Intelligence Press - no agreement required.
Accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Dow Jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Reuters - working on new month-to-month contract with them.

We will work with Leslie on getting written consents.

Thanks,

Dave
