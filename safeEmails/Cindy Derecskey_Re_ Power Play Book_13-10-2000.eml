Vince,

I'm really feeling like a blind mouse about this because I haven't (nor has=20
Christie, Mike and Mark) read Mr. Mehta's comments.  I believe that we would=
=20
be better equipped to discuss the course of action that should be taken, if=20
any, after we are well versed with Mr. Mehta and his perspectives.

Although, I do suggest that if we do decide to proceed, we should approach i=
t=20
by addressing the issues Mr. Mehta discussed under a different premise, i.e.=
=20
sponsor a speaking engagement where one of the speakers' topics would be=20
related to Mr. Mehta's topic - allowing us to strategically tell our side of=
=20
the story without it appearing that this is a planned rebuttal.  We should=20
specifically invite those who attended Mr. Mehta's engagement, but not limit=
=20
it to this group.

Let's all discuss this once our group has read Mr. Mehta' comments.

Regard,


Cindy

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world=20

attract attention.

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that w=
e=20
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my=20
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a=20
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.co=
m=20
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr.=20
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments ma=
y=20
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw=20
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with=20
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have=
=20
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's=20
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient=20
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in=20

I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important=20

I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales o=

the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr.=20

our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an=20

to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be=20

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently=20
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her=20
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter=20
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jone=
s=20
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly troubl=
e=20
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow=
=20
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy
