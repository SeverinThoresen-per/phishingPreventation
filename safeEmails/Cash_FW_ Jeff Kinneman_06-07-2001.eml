Hi Michelle,

I received the employment agreements for Jeff Kinneman for execution by the =
company.  John Sherriff has signed them and as such I am returning them to y=
ou.  However, please confirm that  John Sherriff is permitted to sign on beh=
alf of Enron North America Corp.

As Jeff is a US employee working in Houston with only a dotted line to Europ=
e, I presume that the compensation team in Houston will be loading the execu=
tive agreement onto the relevant compensation system, and ensuring that the =
contract is passed to the relevant person for requesting the options etc. ( =
I know that it used to be Mary McKendree, so I am copying Pam on this messag=
e).

Regards

Melissa
