Effective 12/31/00, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P., CP ID 72297 merged=20
with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., CP ID 53350.  I have received=20
copies of the Secretary of State certificate as well as the Certificate of=20
Merger.  Today, I suspended the old record, so that new business will not=20
attach to it.  Normally, notification would have been sent out on the 15th o=
f=20
the month, but since I have received phone calls, e-mails expressing=20
concern,  and  copies of the documents from various groups (I appreciate=20
it!), we thought it best to send notification now.  It will also appear on=20
the next report.

Thanks,
