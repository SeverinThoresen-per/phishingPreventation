I need to discuss this deal with you...it is essentially a physical option t=
o supply steel to a very large service center with locations in the US and i=
n Europe.  The challenge for you guys will be that it will require a $30mil =
option payment to them.  Very good deal without credit issues...pls call me =
when you have a chance.

I have run an indicative credit reserve which comes out at $15m.

It should be made clear at this stage the number is only indicative and subj=
ect to further change and discussion.  Forward price curves and volatilities=
 will need to be confirmed, as will the option structure.

We still want to achieve the best possible contractual terms through pursuin=
g collateral rights and should consider other risk-mitigating options such a=
s bankruptcy protection.  The tenor and $ exposure would warrant sign-off at=
 a very senior level, and will obviously be covered by the DASH approval.

The deal is clearly of great value to Enron, but we should question the moti=
ves of Balli in wanting or needing to do this.  How much do we know about th=
eir exisiting banking relationships and ability to access funding at present=
?

I'm sure we will discuss further.

Bruce Garner has asked me to bring you into a trade we're looking at with Ba=
lli-Klockner (BK). Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week=
 back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed=
=2E This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under t=
ime constraints and keen to move fast.

The transaction is as follows:

Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (C=
RU HRC) + 7.5%=20

Start:  Jan2002

End:    Dec2016

Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million =
MT)

Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.

The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at =
Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates =
to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium=
).

Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockn=
er PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings =
Ltd UK). BK are not offering us additional credit relief, ie. bank guarantee=
s, LC's, insurance bonds, etc. Your help in establishing our appetite and an=
 appropriate credit charge for this transaction would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Simon Cose
