Robert,
 I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is=
=20
a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the=20
language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call=
=20
if you have any questions.

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline=20
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing=20
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M=
3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on th=
e=20
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone=20
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3. =20

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible. =20

Thanks -

Rob
