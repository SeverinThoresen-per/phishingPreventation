Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is languag=
e=20
that states that the original LC will accompany any draw that is made for=20
endorsement of the drawing amount and that it will be returned to the=20
Beneficiary unless it is fully drawn upon. =20


I don't see any problem with this and while it may be unnecessary, if it=20
males them feel better to have it, i would like to keep it in.  Are you okay=
=20
with this?

Carol
