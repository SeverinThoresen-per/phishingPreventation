Here is a report on current Muni deals in the west. =20

1. Grant County PUD:  (Washington)   we have orally agreed (no signed=20
confirms) to two identical deals,  each calls for us to deliver power to=20
Grant during year one and for Grant to deliver us power and money in year 4=20
or 5.  Our effort to get an opinion from them that these deals have been=20
properly authorized has foundered badly.  We have the classic situation of a=
=20
PUD whose procedural practice does not fit with the statute.  They are=20
irritated to have this pointed out to them and so far, unwilling to go back=20
and fix their practices for fear of embarassment before the Board. =20
Delicate,  complex, difficult mess.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives helping.  =20

2.  Clatskanie: (Oregon)  We have done a deal ( signed confirms and EEI soon=
=20
to be signed) whereby we deliver Clatskanie power in year 1, for which we=20
receive a monthly payment which is roughly akin to a contract price,  and=20
they deliver us power in year 5.   We have every expectation of receiving a=20
satisfactory legal opinion from them when they return the signed EEI=20
agreement.

3. EWEB: (Oregon)   We have done a deal (being documented as a swap by the=20
swap group) which I believe is a five year deal.  The deal was originally=20
conceived as being a physical transaction.  We  received satisfactory=20
documentation about authorization from EWEB for the physical transaction, bu=
t=20
when it switched over to being a swap at the last minute,  and Sara=20
subsequently reviewed the authorization issue,  her conclusion was that we=20
were not satisfied with what EWEB had shown us.  I have gotten Pat Boylston =
=20
to get EWEB to promise to give us a Board resolution in a couple of weeks=20
addressing the financial risk concern. =20

4. Valley Coop. (Nevada)  We have recently done a 4 year vanilla commodity=20
sale to Valley and are in the process of checking out their authorization to=
=20
do longer term deals.   We have a services agreement with them whereby we ar=
e=20
their SC for load balancing purposes involving the California market.  A=20
question has arisen as to whether or not certain sales we make to them as=20
part of this arrangement  may generate revenue for them in excess of 15%,  i=
f=20
so, perhaps putting their tax exempt status as a muni in jeopardy.  It is a=20
tax, accounting issue.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives is helping us sort it ou=
t.

5. LMUD (California)  City of Lassen.  We are trying to do a long term sale=20
of power to them.  Attempts to check out authorization have run into a=20
complex, California municipality statute and a small town lawyer and we are=20
presently stalled out.  Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle is helping as best=20
he can.  The commercial deal died its first death yesterday but rigor mortis=
=20
is not complete and we may have to revive authorization efforts.

6.  Tracy Ngo has given us a long list of munis, prioritized as to our credi=
t=20
exposure to them.  Presumably I am busy checking all of the most serious one=
s=20
out and making sure we have proper authorizations.  In fact, I have done=20
nothing with this  because I am busy with other immediate priorities. =20

Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives and Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle are=20
providing very valuable service in this area.  They are both very good at=20
dealing with these muni type folks and, with the exception of Grant, (and no=
t=20
because of Pat, who has been great)  have gotten fairly good results so=20
far.----cgy
