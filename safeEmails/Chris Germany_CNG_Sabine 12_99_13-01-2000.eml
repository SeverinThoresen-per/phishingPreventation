Hi!  Remember last month changing the rate in sitara so the
discounts could be taken....well, I need it done for 12/99 now.
The total volumes for CNG/Sabine for 12/99 are
7,676,198 and we should be paying $13,298.60 for at rate of .00172794.
Let me know if you need more information, or copies, or whatever.  And
does emailing this work ok, or what would work best to update this every
month?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria.  How are you?
