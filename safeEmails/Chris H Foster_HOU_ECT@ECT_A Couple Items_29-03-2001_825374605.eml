To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan=
 offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  Th=
at puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you b=
e able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available. =20

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the =
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and av=
oid transmission. =20

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  =
I remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite bein=
g a better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America d=
oes not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electri=
city contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is=
 not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to m=
ake it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US =
subsidiary of BHP correct?
