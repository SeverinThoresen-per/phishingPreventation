If you decide to move to Kerrville I know of an excellent builder that I
have worked with in the past.

He has built numerous custom homes in the Kerrville\Fredericksburg area that
are very high quality.  He has excellent long time crews using local German
craftsmen. They do outstanding trim work and framing.  Most of his houses
are Texas style with solid rock walls, standing seam roofs, antique wood
flooring, cabinets, etc.

Let me know if you are interested.
