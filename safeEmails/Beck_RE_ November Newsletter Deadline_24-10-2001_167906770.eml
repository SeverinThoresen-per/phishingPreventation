Pumpkin recipe dip attached. =20

Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next yea=

t is the job that you are really doing!

Meagan sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to whi=
ch she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out=
 the door!  --Sally=20

Sally - We can probably use the pumpkin dip recipe; with so many ads we may =
need 2 pull-out pages (calendar/minutes being one).  Plus, it would be great=
 for everyone to have it for the upcoming holidays.
Faxing or email will be the best way to get info to me today - it's back-to-=
back dentist appointments, manicures (my indulgence!), tumbling, cheerleadin=
g, etc. so I will out more than I'm in.
I really enjoy the newsletter and will be happy to remain in this position f=
or next year (if you'd like me to!).  With my advertising/journalism backgro=
und - although it's been a lot of years since I've used it very much - this =
is just my "thing".  And with such rapid changes in technology, it's a chall=
enge to learn new skills!
Have a great day, and I'll look for the additional info - Thanks!  Robin
