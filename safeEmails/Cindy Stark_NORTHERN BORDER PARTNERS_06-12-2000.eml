FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit=20
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald=20
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of=20
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.
