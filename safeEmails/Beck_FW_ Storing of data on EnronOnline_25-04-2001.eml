Subject:	Storing of data on EnronOnline

I spoke with Sally regarding the cessation of sending confirms for EnronOnli=
ne transactions, and she mentioned that the question was raised as to how lo=
ng we store transaction details on EnronOnline.

We store all transactions on the database since inception, in order to facil=
itate customer transaction searches. This data is the basic buy/sell, commod=
ity, location, volume, price, customer, userid, and time info. In addition f=
or a rolling 45 day period we store the web server info which is much more d=
etailed and has product ID's, session ID's and so forth. At the end of 45 da=
ys it is archived and retrievable. when you put these two together you have =
a very complete picture of what happened to a transaction attempt.

I hope this answers any questions you may have. If not let me know.
