Subject: Trading on Inside Information

In a meeting yesterday with some ENA traders, it was argued that in the=20
finanical markets people are not allowed to trade in a stock if they have=20
material information that would move the market.

In the power business, people that control 15,000 MW are allowed to buy and=20
sell financial products with the "inside" knowledge that their units may be=20
off.  Is this illegal or could we make it illegal?  What are the restriction=
s=20
here?

I guess the issue also involves CFTC regulation, or lack of regulation?  If=20
FERC has the field, why don't we continue to push for more market=20
transparency?

Jim
