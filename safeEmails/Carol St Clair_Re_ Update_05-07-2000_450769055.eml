Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions,=
=20
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all th=
e=20
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his=
=20
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the=20
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are=20
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that=20
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom=20
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara.=20
011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can=20
discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.
Thanks and regards.=20

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are=20

relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican=20

Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the=20
