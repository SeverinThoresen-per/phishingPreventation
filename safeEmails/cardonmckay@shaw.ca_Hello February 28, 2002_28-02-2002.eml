Hi Jon,

Thinking of you and thought I'd try out your new e-mail address.  Hope you a=
re having a good day.It snowed again last night, but is suppose to warm up a=
 bit today. Dad got home late last night from Vancouver.  He said it was ver=
y nice there.

I forgot to tell you and Beth last time we talked that the pointsettia you g=
ave Dad when he was in hospital at Christmas is still doing well,  The other=
 ones I had are long gone.  Just thought you should know that it probably pa=
ys to spend the buck on them as it must mean they are better cared for durin=
g growth.  Also, did you ever call Grandpa and what did he have to say?  I t=
alked to him briefly last night but didn't want to ask if you had talked to =
him in case you hadn't.  He asked about you though and was of course pleased=
 to hear you were working.  He has a very sore throat so I didn't talk very =
long.

Okay I don't want to take up too much of your time.  Love you.

Mum
