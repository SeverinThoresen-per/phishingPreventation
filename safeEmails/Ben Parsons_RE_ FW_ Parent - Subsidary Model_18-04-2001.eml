Hi Iris

We started off with about 105 companies, which were Enron Europe's UK power=20
and gas desk counterparties. I'm not sure where you got the figure of 500=20
from - maybe this is the entire Enron Europe counterparty list, which=20
constitutes the next major effort for end-July.

=46rom this list of 104, only the 72 in the spreadsheet had information in=20
Amadeus. The other firms had no information available, most likely because=20
they were too new.

Hi again,

 Thanks for the financial data on Enron's European counterparties.

 It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such=20
counterparties.  However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72=20
of these European counterparties.

 Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400+ other=20
counterparties?=20

Thanks so much,
Iris

Hi Iris

The inputs and outputs generated by RiskCalc can be seen in the attached fil=
e:

 << File: Data for RiskCalc - 20010323_PD.csv >>=20

We only looked at the 5-yr PD.

Inputs are in columns A-U. These are the inputs generated by Amadeus. You ca=
n=20
run these inputs through the RiskCalc model over the web=20
(http://www.moodysqra.com/privfirm) using the login: dupred, password:=20
detective. This is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks (Mik=
e=20
Mumford will have more details about the current licence)

Tomas Valnek was getting the data from the Amadeus database, so I'll leave i=
t=20
to him to determine if Houston access is possible. In the meantime you can=20
use the dataset attached for testing purposes.

Hi Ben,

 How are you?  Today we had a meeting with Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman to=
=20
discuss the private firm model.

 They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the Moody's=20
Riskcalc model.  I noticed that you also have been looking at RiskCalc - as=20
indicated in your paper entitled "Pricing Parent Companies and their=20
Subsidiaries:  Model Description and Data Requirements"

 Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test=
=20
statistics, scores, etc. =20

 Also, you stated that you used Amadeus database.  We are in the process of=20
trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.=
 =20
In the mean time, may we have access to the Amadeus database or some sample=20
dataset?

=20
Thanks so much,
Iris
