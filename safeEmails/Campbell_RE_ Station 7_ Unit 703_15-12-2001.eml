Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the e=
ngine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows t=
he load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testi=
ng for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the A=
ir Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy. =
 My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our=
 agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Abo=
ve this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to rais=
e the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusio=
n about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy o=
f the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 inst=
ead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs i=
t.

    Update: =20

      I have communicated with Rick Stallings (Cubix Corp) about an hour ago=
 and Rick recalls our past conversation concerning the horsepower & load dis=
crepancies for unit 703.  Rick no longer has the data in his data base, but =
will be glad to make the necessary adjustments with attached explanations fo=
r our records in case their are any questions.

     The corrected torque load should have been 96 %.

Larry Wayne will this work for you?
