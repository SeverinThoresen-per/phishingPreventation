Susan and Susan:
Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus=
=20
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketin=
g=20
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading=20
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP")=20

We have Masters with both of these entities.


I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the followin=
g=20
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to=
=20
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the=20
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok=20
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes=20
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.


Carol
