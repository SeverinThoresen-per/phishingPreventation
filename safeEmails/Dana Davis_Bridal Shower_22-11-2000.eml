Good Morning My Sisters In Christ,

I am writing you on behalf of a bridal shower that my sister wants to give m=
e
on Dec. 2nd at 6:30 pm. I want to extend an invitation to all of you who are
interested in coming. For those of you that would be interested, I will need
your address forwarded to Kathy (my sister) and copy me. Her email address i=
s
 kathy-lacy@reliantenergy.com and you can copy me here to my my home email
address. I would also appreciate it if you would get the word out to others
that do not have email and to others that might be interested in coming. I
was asked to get this information 2 weeks ago but I have been on the run so
please forgive me for this late hour if you please. Thank you in advance for
your response.

Edith:-)
