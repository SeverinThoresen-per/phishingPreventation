Group,
As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pac=
ific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than=
 some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summar=
y of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain=
 time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disp=
utes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you=
 have any questions regarding this expectation.
Thanks,

Bill
