I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent m=
y CEO of Enron yesterday.
Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.    This i=
s our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.  And as of  9:11=
 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.  =
Hopefully,  we can close ont he Highs.

	As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not b=
egin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of Enron sin=
ce June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions a=
nd or ask direct questions.=20
	I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catast=
rophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM=
 !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market =
place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan =
of action, attack it, and save this company.
