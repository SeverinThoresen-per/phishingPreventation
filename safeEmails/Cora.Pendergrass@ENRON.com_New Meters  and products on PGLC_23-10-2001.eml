The basic reason we are changing meters in Sitara is because when PGLC was o=
riginally set up, the meters were set up using the same name as what the pip=
eline called them, i.e. NGPL/909265. This is the NGPL meter number NOT the P=
GLC meter number.  The PGLC Meter number is PGLC/NGPL.  The only reason we a=
re doing this is so we can have everything correctly reflected so we can upl=
oad noms into pegasys with the meter number PGLC specifically used.=20

The 3 products that will be in place for November at PGLC are:

NBPL/Manhattan - this is where we are buying Northern Border Specific Gas to=
 take to PGLC at the NBPL/Peoples/82 (Manhattan transfer point).  We will th=
en have a meter bounce ticket to take it from NBPL/PGLC/82 to PGLC/NBPL/NB01=
 and take it into our pool.

NGPL/Peoples - this is where we are buying NGPL specific gas to take to PGLC=
 at the NGPL/Peoples/909285 Meter.  We will then have a meter bounce ticket =
to take it from NGPL/Peoples/909285 to PGLC/NGPL/NGPL and take it into our p=
ool.

CHI Peoples - this is where we are buying pool gas at PGLC at the TTP pool. =
- this is the product that has been out there but all deals will be mapped t=
o the TTP point. THis is where the majority of customers give us our gas.


The only time we will be using the meter PGLC/NGPL/NGPL, PGLC/NBPL/NB01, PGL=
C/ANR/ANR,  and other PGLC/pipeline specific meters is when gas is actually =
being delivered on a contract into the gate.  For the most part all of our g=
as will be at meter PGLC/TTP/TTP.


Thanks!!
