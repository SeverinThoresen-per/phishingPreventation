Two of the internet attorneys at Marval came over today to look at the syste=
m=20
online.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer=20
to.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?

1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of=
=20
the password application that prohibits the user form using the password=20
outside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but=20
was not sure.

2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC=20
each time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a=
=20
separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought=
=20
several related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I=20
thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that=20
for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have=20
reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?

3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for=20
use of the system?

4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. fo=
r=20
each product could be considered "content" for EOL and be considered value=20
for which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issu=
e=20
before but I said I would ask.

5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic=20
trade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the=20
data.  How would the data be presented to a court? =20

6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are=20
they retained?

Any help you can give me would be appreciated.=20

Thanks,
Brent
