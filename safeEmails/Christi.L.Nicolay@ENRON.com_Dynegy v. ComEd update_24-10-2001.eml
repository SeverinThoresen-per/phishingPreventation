Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later =
today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that t=
here are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources an=
d that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually=
 trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy=
's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provi=
sions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is e=
ntitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the netw=
ork v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the ma=
rket/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problem=
s.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint=
 against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron give=
n EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've ou=
tlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track proc=
essing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  I=
n order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide=
 to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Eli=
zabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know w=
hat you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer =
firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy arg=
ues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Re=
sources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer d=
esignated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrat=
e that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an execut=
ed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to o=
thers, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commit=
ment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity=
 without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm ins=
tead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carrie=
d to serve retail load
=09
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacit=
y and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as netwo=
rk resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted trans=
mission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these partie=
s designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contr=
acts were in place with IP.
