WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 	=09

  By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith=20
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal=20

UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acqui=
re Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the de=
al will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generat=
or of 90% of the Houston company's profit.=20

But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated b=
y the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enr=
on wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, ind=
icating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recov=
er what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protectio=
n on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from credit=
ors as it seeks to reorganize.=20

Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, =
Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its =
wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people =
and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline=
 Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's h=
uge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also woul=
dn't provide any cash upfront to Enron.=20

Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the ener=
gy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enr=
on. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the p=
ayment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron =
5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty el=
iminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by=
 the end of the fifth year.=20

As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increa=
se by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax=
 profit.=20

Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it=
 was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathe=
d into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largel=
y on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The =
trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter =
11 filing last month.=20

Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a=
 new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But=
 Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no =
bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies=
=2E One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business=
 would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operatio=
ns and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are do=
ing and to constantly revalue the trading book.=20

Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show=
 they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron =
pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of ener=
gy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price =
volatility.=20

Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this =
business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" =
by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. =
UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There i=
s no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enr=
on's thousands of creditors.=20

The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be r=
evived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its bi=
ggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated abou=
t $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has b=
een dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bank=
ruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dea=
d that we are trying to bring back to life."=20

Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted=
 at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practi=
ce likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael Mc=
Nally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity tra=
der in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only =
a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact=
 trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for mos=
t uses.=20

UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S.=
 market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. J=
ohn Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would=
 be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."=20

The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, wa=
s announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less =
than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advis=
ers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated=
 nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon=
 said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, ha=
d submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of =
the Enron unit.=20

The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonza=
lez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who o=
fficially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thu=
rsday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections.=20

Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case t=
o Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron'=
s headquarters city was a more suitable venue.=20
