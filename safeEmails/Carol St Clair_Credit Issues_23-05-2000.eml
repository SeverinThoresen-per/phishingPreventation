I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points=20
that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the=20
cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the=20
Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you =
a=20
new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated i=
n=20
your draft.
