Dear Ken,

I am conducting a review of Enron for TCW's equity portfolios.  You may=20

of Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America investmen=
t=20
department and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.  I am now=
=20
working as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With the=20
encouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently i=
n=20
Phoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron=20
stock.

I am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to Enron for=20
Leigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you, Clifford=20
Baxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and any=20
other individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your=20
business.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.

The date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other=

managers.  The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are=20
particularly convenient for us.

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to learning more about=20
