Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules=20
 Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peake=
r' facilities.=20


By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer





     SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits o=
n heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summ=
er as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state.=20
     State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid black=
outs.=20
     Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollut=
ion fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural =
gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Res=
ources Board.=20
     Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Wa=
ter and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200=
 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are permi=
tted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so =
heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.=20
     Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air po=
llution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.=20
     In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have t=
he effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diese=
l generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.=20
     "If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired pla=
nts]," said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to die=
sel more frequently."=20
     Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't ru=
n these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run somethin=
g dirtier."=20
     Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can =
run and the amount of energy they can produce."=20
     New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt=
-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the=
 order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-h=
our.=20
     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours thi=
s summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of o=
xides of nitrogen emitted into the air.=20
     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extr=
a pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per =
pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,0=
00 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would =
be used to reduce air pollution from other sources.=20
     "Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and =
pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail Rud=
erman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Ou=
r concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission=
 reductions any time soon."=20
     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one p=
eaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent=
 of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant E=
nergy could not be reached for comment Monday night.=20
     "To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's goi=
ng to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to mak=
e our air dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ven=
tura County.=20
     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was ne=
eded so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this=
 summer.=20
     "This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of =
our excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said.=20
     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a pri=
ce for the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as low=
 as we can legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district ar=
e not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility dist=
ricts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order.=20
     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell powe=
r to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Relia=
nt Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called o=
n Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired fa=
cilities.=20
     "This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in =
Ventura County residents' lungs," said Baldwin of Ventura County.=20
     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also=
 said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of=
 what they had sought.=20
     "We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural R=
esources Defense Council. "It's taking the discretion away from local air di=
stricts to regulate power plants in their region."=20
