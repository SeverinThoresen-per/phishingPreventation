I spoke today to a staff member of the Cabinet of Minister Deleuze, Belgian=20
Federal Minister for Energy and Sustainable Development.  As you will know,=20
Minister Deleuze will be chair of the EU Environment Ministers as of July=20
when Belgium takes over the rotating Presidency of the EU.  Thus he is=20
presently intimately concerned with EU follow up to Kyoto.

The Cabinet of Deleuze is taking very seriously reports that Bush will table=
=20
a series of initiatives at the Bonn COP VI meeting, which are designed to ge=
t=20
the US time to consider a comprehensive new approach to climate change issue=
s=20
and will finally ditch consideration of Kyoto (by others). The EU (in my=20
opinion) would seek to counter any such 'wrecking tactics' by increasing the=
=20
pressure on the US in the interim (though the sensible political response,=20
tabling EU suggestions that the US would have to reject, seems to have elude=
d=20
the EU till now).

The end point of any such plan by Bush would be a US emphasis on trade/marke=
t=20
based mechanisms, no multilateral approach but bilateral deals, and=20
technology transfer.

(If we have any messages on this issue for the EU, this contact would be a=20
good input point.)

Incidentally, in Brussels today, Thomas Brewer of the Jorunal of=20
International Business Studies, gave a very persuasive account of why the=20
Republican leadership is out of touch even with its rank and file membership=
=20
on environmental issues.  He used polling data to indicate this, and the=20
suggested conclusion, that Bush will now have to move  'constructively' on=20
the issue, was well argued.

Lastly, do we have a contact in Washington who could comment on this?
