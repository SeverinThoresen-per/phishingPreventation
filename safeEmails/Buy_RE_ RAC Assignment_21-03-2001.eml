I see no reason not to except they rotate out in a year. Maybe we could have=
 them rotate to another group in RAC. We need bodies so my vote would be to =
take him if he passes our test. Rick

What is your view on taking analysts from the program in the group?  He may =
be able to help with some of the credit analysis that we are backlogged on?

Mr. Bradford:
=20
I just wanted to reiterate my interest in a RAC  rotation, following our con=
versation last week. I have had a chance to  speak to some analysts in RAC a=
nd I am convinced that it would be an  unparalled learning opportunity. Once=
 again, I will be starting in the analyst  program this July, and I am gradu=
ating from UT Austin with both  a BBA and MPA. I am also taking the CPA exam=
 this May. Lexi Elliot from HR  should be getting in touch with you followin=
g my conversation with her this  morning regarding a RAC rotation. Many than=
ks once again for your  assistance.
