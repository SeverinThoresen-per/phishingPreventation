Hey Phillip,

I have gone into travel planning mode and wanted to invite both you and
Keith on a scuba expedition.

Greg, our friend Larry Hudler and I are planning a trip to Fiji January 24th
to Feb. 2nd.  All in, the trip should be about $2,000.  This includes
Airfare, Condo, Diving, Food, and Drink, and maybe a little more drink.

Let me know if either of you can attend.

Darrell
