John:
The Schedules look fine.  Just one minor chnage which I can maker.  In the=20
form of LC, I'm deleting the words "Rider 1" at the bottm and in the last=20
paragrpah of page 1, chnagung the word "receipts" to "receipt".  We will=20
generate and send to you execution sets.  With respect to the Guaranty, we=20
would prefer that you sue the fopm which I sent to you a few weeks ago.  Her=
e=20
it is.  This form is our updated form and matches up with the Enron Guaarnty=
=20
that we are giving you.

Carol -

Enclosed are what I hope will be the final drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph
13, LC provisions, and Schedule 1.

I have accepted and incorporated the new changes you made plus all the
changes which we have agreed upon.  I also changed the presentation of our
address in Part 4a of the schedule - it's the same information presented in
a more concise way.  Finally, I changed the signature block on the schedule
to eliminate EPME-Gas Company (it no longer exists) as a 'general partner" -
I don't know where that came from.

Also enclosed is our version of the Guarantee.  Please let me know if any
other changes are required.  If not, let's proceed with execution copies -
let me know if you want to generate them, or if you want me to.

John
