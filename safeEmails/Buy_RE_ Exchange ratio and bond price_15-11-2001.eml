As we discussed yesterday, the exchange ratio adjusted price comparison is t=
he key ratio to guage market merger appetite.   I also included the ENE 6 5/=
8% 10/15/03 bond price to view the credit market's perception.
I'll send it around from time to time.  An excel file is attached.


Regards,


Michael
