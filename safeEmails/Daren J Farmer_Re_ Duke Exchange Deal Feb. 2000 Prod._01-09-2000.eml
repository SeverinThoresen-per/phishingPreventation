Katherine,=20

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I=20
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

Let me know how you want to handle it.
