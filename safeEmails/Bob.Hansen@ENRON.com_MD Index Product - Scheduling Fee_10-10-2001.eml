Good Morning....

As a placeholder, Narsimha previously suggested $0.25/MWH for the scheduling=
 fee component of the fixed "Management Fee".  Do you think this is still a =
reasonable number to use?  If so, we would use it in our notional estimates,=
 and Deal Management would use the same value for executable pricing.  =20

Thanks!
Bob
