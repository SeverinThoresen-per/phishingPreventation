I have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it, except to the e=
xtent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that Corp=
=2E is looking to implement.

I agree with Paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement=
 that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-fo=
r personnel.

Paul, it might make sense for you to talk with Robert Jones and David Oxley,=
 who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist att=
acks.

Can't this be communicated as a simple Field Ops "practice" going forward in=
stead of Policy? I'd rather see it be sold as  "this makes sense for all of =
us to do" vs. "do this because it is Policy" Additionally, what will be the =
consequences for not adhering to policy? Shouldn't we also state management =
will proactively track down their employees and together we will account for=
 everyone's safety.

I would appreciate your review of the policy set out below.  As you can see,=
 the policy has already been circulated, without legal review.  While we may=
 all have had comments or suggestions, is there anything you think would req=
uire recirculation?  Thank you.  Lance.=20

Was this reviewed by legal? If not I would like the wording checked and if n=
ecessary clarified relative to the obligations; expressed or implied regardi=
ng employee safety. certainly, knowing of the status of employees is importa=
nt in an emergency.

Team,

Please consider the policy outlined below to be effective immediately.



EMERGENCY CHECK IN POLICY
FOR
EBS FIELD OPERATIONS EMPLOYEES


In light of the recent tragedies that occurred in New York City and Washingt=
on, D.C., Enron Broadband Services Field Operations is adopting a new policy=
 that requires field operations personnel to check-in during unusual situati=
ons and emergencies, whether natural or man-made.  Through this check in, ma=
nagement will be able to ensure that any and all necessary measures are take=
n to provide for the safety of employees.=20

Therefore, in the event of a disaster or emergency, all EBS employees and co=
ntractors shall call the Network Operations Center in Houston at 800 267-702=
8, as soon as they can do so safely, to advise EBS management of their statu=
s.  Since some personnel may be traveling or on a temporary assignment known=
 only to their immediate supervision, all personnel are requested to check-i=
n, not only those physically assigned to a location near the event.  Personn=
el on vacation or other leave should also make an effort to check-in so thei=
r safety can be assured as well. Phone contact is preferable, however, email=
 or other communication services are acceptable. When you make the call, ple=
ase provide the following information:

Name
Phone number where you can be reached
Immediate Supervisor
Current location
Assigned location
Any assistance required

It is the goal and focus of the company to provide a safe and secure work at=
mosphere for all employees.  Should you have any other further suggestions i=
n this regard, please forward them to Herb Caballero, our safety manager, wh=
o is charged with developing policies to ensure your safety.

Regards,

Allan Grimm
Senior Director, Field Operations
