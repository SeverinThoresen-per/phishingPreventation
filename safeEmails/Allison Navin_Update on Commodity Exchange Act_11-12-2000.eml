Commodity Law Rewrite Still Alive
CQ Weekly
December 9, 2000

A deal to revive legislation (H.R. 4541) that would rewrite the nation=01,s=20
commodities laws appeared to be in the works after meetings the week of=20
December 4 between representatives of Chicago=01,s big commodities exchanges=
 and=20
the senator who had been blocking the bill.

Representatives of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchang=
e=20
reached a tentative agreement with Senator Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of=20
the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, on compromise language tha=
t=20
would reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act and set new ground rules for th=
e=20
trading of a complicated class of investments known as derivatives,=20
congressional aides said.

The language was being reviewed by aides to the House Agriculture, Banking=20
and Commerce committees, each of which had a hand in drafting the original=20
bill, as well as by the Treasury Department.

If there are no objections, the language could be attached to the=20
still-pending fiscal 2000 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill (H.R. 4577=
).

The original commodities bill passed the House 377-4, on October 19.

However, Gramm has blocked the measure because of concerns over how it would=
=20
affect the legal status if a type of privately negotiated contracts known as=
=20
swaps.  Swaps, which are used by large corporations to hedge market risk,=20
account for a global market worth nearly $90 trillion, according to the Bank=
=20
for International Settlements in Switzerland.

The legislation would keep swaps unregulated.  It would also give the=20
commodities exchanges a boost by authorizing the trading of futures contract=
s=20
based on single stocks.

Trading such investments on U.S. exchanges is currently prohibited because=20
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange=20
Commission cannot agree on who would regulate the instruments.  The=20
legislation would give both agencies regulatory oversight.
