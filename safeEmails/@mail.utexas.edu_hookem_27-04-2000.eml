Backup quarterback
leaving Texas

Associated Press

Posted: April 26, 2000

AUSTIN -- Adam Hall, the Texas Longhorns
backup quarterback during spring drills,
said
he will transfer from the University of
Texas
this fall, coach Mack Brown announced
Wednesday.

"The biggest factor was that I want to
have a
chance to be a starter in the near
future," said
Adam Hall, a redshirt freshman from
Westlake
High School.

The university has released Hall from his

scholarship. Hall plans to complete the
spring
semester then enroll in another
institution in
the fall. The new institution was not
named in
a news release.

"I love all of my teammates and
appreciate
everything the coaches and staff have
done for
me at Texas, but I think I will have a
better
opportunity to play sooner at another
school,"
he said.

Hall completed four of five passes for 85
yards
and a touchdown in Texas' spring game on
April 1. He completed 143 of 263 passes
for
2,188 yards and 21 touchdowns at Westlake

in 1998.

Brown said Hall was a hardworking young
man
on the field and in the classroom. He
wished
the 6-foot-2, 205-pound quarterback luck
at his
next destination.

"Obviously we are very disappointed
because
we felt that Adam had a good spring and
we
have been very pleased with his
progress,"
Brown said.

I'll call you when I get home tonight (around 6).

Love you,
Jenn
