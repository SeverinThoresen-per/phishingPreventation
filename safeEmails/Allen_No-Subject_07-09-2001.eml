Jacques,

I sent you a fax of Kevin Kolb's comments on the release.  The payoff on the=
 note would be $36,248 ($36090(principal) + $158 (accrued interest)).
This is assuming we wrap this up on Tuesday. =20

Please email to confirm that their changes are ok so I can set up a meeting =
on Tuesday to reach closure.

Phillip
