	The "CMS Approvers" in Omaha (Kent, Dave, Mary Kay, Dari, etc.) will be mig=
rated to Outlook sometime this week.  It is very important that if you have =
any deals that are routing or that will route before Thursday (7/19), that y=
ou notify Linda Trevino (x3-5413) immediately.  Any deals that are started, =
and need routing approvals, will need to be completed the same day or they w=
ill have to be killed and re-routed when the Outlook migration has been comp=
leted.  Please forward this to anyone in your region that works in the CMS s=
ystem.  Thanks!
