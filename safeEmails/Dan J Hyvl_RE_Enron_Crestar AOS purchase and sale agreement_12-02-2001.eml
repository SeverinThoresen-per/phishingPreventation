Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to=20
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central=20
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involve=
d=20
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially=
=20
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  M=
y=20
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts=20
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its tru=
e=20
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central=
=20
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not=20
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Grant

We are wondering if you received our fax of January 30, 2001 and if so
whether you have had an opportunity to consider it.
