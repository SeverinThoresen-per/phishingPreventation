The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially)=
=2E  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate =
focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge v=
olume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis=
, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the=
 data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I=
 don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produce=
d by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if th=
e top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very clo=
se to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their c=
ontracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data.=
 Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the =
parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.

Sara,

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact p=
erson to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a star=
t, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, =
for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterpart=
ies (as measured by positive net MTM)
