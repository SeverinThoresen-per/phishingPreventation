Just to confirm what Dan Hyvl told me:

Use GTCs on both those deals until he can review the Single Transaction=20
Purchase Firm contract (96005067).  Based on preliminary information, he=20
feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master.  If Dan later=20
determines that those transactions should indeed be under the contract, we=20
can change the contract and inform the Confirms group (and Logistics if=20
necessary) accordingly. =20

Please keep Elizabeth informed of what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do.

Thanks,
SBR

Stacey,

FYI

I had to go ahead a set up a GTC for this deal and another deal just like it=
=20
with the same cp and term dates 643625.

Maybe we can go over these today.

Thanks,
Sharon

Remember I have to leave early today, so if we don't get to it today then=20
please remind me first thing tomorrow and we'll finish our review of it.  If=
=20
Elizabeth calls you regarding the deal, you can set up a GTC if necessary bu=
t=20
I'd rather be sure before we do anything else.  Since gas doesn't flow on=20
this deal until 03/01/01, it shouldn't be an issue today.

THANKS!

Hey Stacey,

Thanks for the clarification, no problem......I just want to make sure you=20
know this is the committed reserve contract that you said we will research=20
later, that is why it is still there.

Sharon,

I'm not trying to make a big deal of it.  I also think that Elizabeth would=20
let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal. =20

This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see=20
when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read "added user tag").  I just=
=20
realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't=20
subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.

I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a=20
Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have=
=20
to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done tha=
t=20
already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same=20
thing.

I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs.=20
face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our=20
policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your=20
portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.

Hope this clears everything up!

Thanks,
SBR

Hi Stacey,

I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on=20
Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have=20
two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after=20
being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary=20
deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the=20
portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that=20
portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure=
=20
they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi Sharon,

I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Frida=
y=20
around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too=20
many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check you=
r=20
portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal=20
won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO=20
outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every=20
day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or=20
requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I=20
also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have=20
attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached=20
(non-problem) deals each day.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular=20
deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make=20
sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy=20
handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.

Thanks!
