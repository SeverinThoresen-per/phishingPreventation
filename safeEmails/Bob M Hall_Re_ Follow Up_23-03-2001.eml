Bob,

I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple=20
weeks ago.  We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down=20
with Daren and working the off system scheduling.

I was talking with Daren last night and he had not heard anything about=20
this.  I plan to begin working with Mark and Mary next week to learn how to=20
schedule these pipes.  Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that=
=20
what we had discussed is still planned.

Thanks for your time.

Mike=20
