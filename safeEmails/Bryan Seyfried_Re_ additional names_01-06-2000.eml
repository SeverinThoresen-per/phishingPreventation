now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be=20
reevaluated?  I think that it will be increasingly difficult to scale at the=
=20
pace we need to over the coming months if we can not design an automated=20
process.  Are we trying to avoid actually misusing confidential information=20
or the perception of misusing the information?  our intent is to begin to=20
scale on a massive level from now until we have reached over a million=20
reference credits.

Bryan -

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General=20
Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of the=
m=20
then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations. =20
Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at=
=20
once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?
