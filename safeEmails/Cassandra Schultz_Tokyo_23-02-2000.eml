Wanda -

FYI, Joe Hirl, the trader in charge of setting up the Tokyo trading office,=20
will be in Houston next week, and it would probably be a good idea if he=20
could interview Mark Frank, or whatever candidate we recommend for the=20
Controller position.   Our Controller for the Sydney office will be up the=20
following week and he should meet with her as well, as that will enable him=20
to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issue=
s=20
we've addressed in Australia.

Sally - did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last?=
 =20
We might want to arrange a meeting with him and Joe also.

Thanks,

Cassandra.
