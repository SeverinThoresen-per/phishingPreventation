	Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name =
is on the list.
	Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the =
list
	and added the new people. =20

	Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for u=
pdates on
	this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?

	Thanks. Lynn
