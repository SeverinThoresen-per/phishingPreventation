Enron and the curse of Drexel=20
Commentary: Energy trader's friends dry up

SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- It was the master of its universe.

Its employees were rich, young and ruthless. It treated its clients and riva=
ls alike, with disdain. Its leader counseled business tycoons and political =
powerbrokers alike. And when the bottom finally fell out, it didn't have a f=
riend in the world to save it.=20

Wall Street loves a success story. But it loves a success story gone wrong e=
ven more. Such was the case for Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond empire=
 of the 1980s, whose spiritual leader Michael Milken orchestrated one of the=
 greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of=
 federal investigations, losses and the largest bankruptcy in Wall Street hi=
story.=20

For Enron, the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than =
two-thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial tran=
sactions and its stability, the similarities are striking.=20

Like Drexel, Enron set out to change an industry. Like Drexel, it succeeded,=
 for a while. Under the guidance of Chairman Ken Lay, Enron evolved from a b=
ackwater Texas natural-gas pipeline company to become the nation's largest e=
nergy merchant.=20

Its EnronOnline business transformed the way energy trading was done and fun=
neled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in=
 last two years. The aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a pro=
fit at all costs made millionaires of many employees, while those who were n=
ot deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms, no questions asked.=
 Enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry.=20

For his part, Lay became an international corporate celebrity, advising Pres=
ident Bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with Vice President Dick C=
heney on the administration's controversial energy plan earlier this year.=20

But Enron's attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and it=
s secretive financial structure finally got the best of it. The unexplained =
resignation of its chief executive in August, the ouster of its chief financ=
ial officer last week and the company's inability to prove its financial hea=
lth have prompted investors to bail out of Enron stock like jackrabbits esca=
ping a brushfire.=20

Now Lay & Co. are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical Wall Street tha=
t is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place (=
sound familiar?). Takeover speculation gave Enron shares a boost Wednesday, =
helping it end a 10-day losing streak. But it's unlikely anyone is going to =
step into this mess before a Securities and Exchange Commission investigatio=
n into its finances yields a few more answers.=20

For investors, a short-term rally beyond the jump Wednesday is still possibl=
e now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares. But at a clos=
ing price of $13.90, Enron shares are more than a Texas mile from their 52-w=
eek high of $84.88 last December.=20

For Enron itself, it's time to put its cards on the table with regulators an=
d Wall Street. As the Drexel saga showed, a strategy of defiance to the end =
only hastens the end.=20
