Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in associati=
on with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of t=
he 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open t=
he videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection. =20

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll=
 then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the=
 release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

--Christie.

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg
