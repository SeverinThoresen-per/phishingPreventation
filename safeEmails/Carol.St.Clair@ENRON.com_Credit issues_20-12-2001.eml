Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating w=
ith us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to c=
ompile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the end =
of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this afternoon =
which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our right=
s are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankruptcy =
we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when in fac=
t we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afternoon I =
found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with Enserco =
under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under the ISDA, =
they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of the expiry da=
te which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can declare an Ev=
ent of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination payment and if t=
hey don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the cure periods =
in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  That's just one ex=
ample.  Do you have any thoughts on this?
