At this time, I am NOT sharing the RAC updated valuation numbers with ECR (a=
nd have told Jesus that).
It would seem like ECR should no longer be privy to that type of ENE info.

Ellen - suggest you handle your valuation tables confidentially also.

Comments anyone  ???



Jim/Felipe - please note

Ellen and I just spoke and she is putting together some information regardin=
g the range of values, size of the transaction, etc. that I would suggest we=
 include with the memo seeking approval of the potential conflict of interes=
t and describing the procedures being implemented to assure fairness in proc=
ess and valuation.  Does that sound like the plan?  Suggestions?     =20

Teresa and I spoke with Sharon Butcher today who recommended that the potent=
ial sale of E&P portfolio should be described and approved at this prelimina=
ry stage by Lavorato, Haedicke, Goerte, and Lay et al per policy regarding c=
onflicts. A DASH would follow when the deal gets further along. The issue he=
re is John Thompson and other employees potentially "negotiating a deal" whi=
ch would include their getting equity in the company which purchases assets.=
 Donna and I just spoke and our thoughts are that the deal description curre=
ntly in draft form would be circulated with an approval cover sheet explaini=
ng the reason for the approval sought.

FYI - Teresa and  I are meeting with the HR rep and the Enron employment att=
orney this aft and then all with John so that he understands what process sh=
ould be followed re the employees - ie his communications with them and with=
 potential purchasers. NAncy        =20
