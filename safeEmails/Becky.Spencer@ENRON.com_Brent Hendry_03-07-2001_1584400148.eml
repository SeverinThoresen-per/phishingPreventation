Brent had to meet with a termite man this morning.  He also had to finish re=
placing some of the wood studs and electrical plugs, etc. before the constru=
ction crew arrived.  The sheetrock has been delivered and the construction c=
rew is now on their way.

Brent will be in the office around noon or so.
