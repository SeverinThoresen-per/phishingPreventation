These counterparties are set up in GCP; however, they have not been set up i=
n RPS and RGS. =20

Two things are needed.  First, we need an automated link from GCP to RPS and=
 RGS.  Someone on Anthony Dayao's team is assigned to this, but the project =
has not been completed.  I have asked Anthony to update me today on how we c=
an get this completed ASAP.  This will solve the problem on a go-forward bas=
is.=20

The second need is a clean up effort on this backlog.  I have asked Beth Apo=
llo for an update on her plan, and I will have her review this with you late=
r today. =20

This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
