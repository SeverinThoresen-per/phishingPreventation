Steve,

Please wire $311,712 to Avista.  This will cover our NW book of business fro=
m Jan 13 thru Jan 19.  I have also emailed you the net P&L associated with t=
his transaction.  Tom at Avista told me they have a new bank and new wire in=
fo, but that Mallorey has already wired to the new bank, so use the bank inf=
o you used for Mallorey's last transaction with Avista.  If you have any que=
stions, please let me know.

Sean
