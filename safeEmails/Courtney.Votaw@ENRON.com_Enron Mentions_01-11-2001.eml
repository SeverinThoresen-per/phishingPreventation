When Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned abruptly in August after six months=
 on the job, longtime Chairman Kenneth Lay assured investors that ``there's =
no other shoe to fall.'' So much for the warning. On Oct. 16, the Houston-ba=
sed energy giant reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years a=
fter taking $1.01 billion in write-offs. It also disclosed a surprising $1.2=
 billion charge to shareholder equity to help unravel complex transactions b=
etween Enron and partnerships that until recently had been overseen by forme=
r Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Then, on Oct. 22, Enron revealed th=
at the Securities & Exchange Commission is probing those Fastow-related tran=
sactions. Two days later, Enron promoted Jeff McMahon to CFO and announced t=
hat Fastow will take a leave of absence. The setbacks have Lay, who has recl=
aimed the CEO post, scrambling. He must get operations back on track, fend o=
ff shareholder lawsuits, and, above all, rebuild credibility with investors.

STOCKWATCH Enron shares resume fall, down 8 pct as SEC opens investigation

11/01/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were sharply lower, down more than 8 pct =
at midsession, as investors continued to fear that the company's dealings wi=
th the LJM partnership could bring heavy financial reprisals following the o=
pening of a formal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, dealer=
s said.=20
At 11.55 am, Enron was down 1.35 usd, or 9.57 pct, to 12.55.
The DJIA rose 61.23 points to 9,136.44, the S&P 500 gained 8.76 points to 1,=
068.40 points, the Nasdaq composite climbed 23.02 points to 1,713.40.=20
Yesterday, Enron announced the election of William Powers Jr to the board, t=
o chair a Special Committee that will examine and take any appropriate actio=
ns with respect to transactions between Enron and entities connected to rela=
ted parties.=20
In addition to reviewing the transactions in question, the Special Committee=
 is charged with communicating with the SEC and recommending any other actio=
ns it deems appropriate.=20
While the investigation might take time to draw a conclusion, the immediate =
cash crunch Enron has been facing is expected to be resolved, said Merrill L=
ynch analyst Duane Grubert.=20
One step in that direction came following Enron's announcement that JP Morga=
n and Salomon Smith Barney Inc have executed commitment letters to provide 1=
 bln usd in secured credit lines supported by the company's Northern Natural=
 Gas and Transwestern Pipeline assets.=20
Over time, Enron has several other options to raise cash, including cutting =
its 400 mln usd per year dividend, cutting back on its 1500 mln usd of capit=
al spending, and monetizing its July 2002 right to convert debt into 11.5 mi=
llion shares of EOG, said Grubert.=20
The danger for the company now is that a "real or fabricated confidence cris=
is by Enron's counterparties threatens near term strength of the merchant se=
gment. Competitors could get mean, and could prematurely shun Enron, while t=
rying to steal market share," he said.=20

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch on Thursday said it lowered both i=
ts mid-term and long-term ratings for Enron Corp. , the No. 1 buyer and sell=
er of natural gas, to "neutral," from "accumulate" and "buy," respectively, =
due to uncertainty about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's inves=
tigation into the company's financial dealings.=20
Analyst Donato Eassey said in a research note that while he "has not altered=
 his view of Enron's fundamentals or its ability to weather the long term st=

"Ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside, we believe significant =
pressure and uncertainty will remain on Enron until the investigation conclu=

The Houston-based company, whose stock has been sent into a tailspin by the =

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., facing a probe by U.S. regulators i=
nto its financial dealings, on Thursday said it obtained $1 billion in secur=
ed credit lines to bolster investor confidence.=20
Enron said J.P. Morgan, the investment banking arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co=

it, which will be secured by Enron's Northern Natural Gas Company and Transw=

The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinanc=

 terms and conditions, including final due diligence, the company said.=20
The announcement came shortly before opening trade on the New York Stock Exc=
hange, where Enron shares plunged $1.60, or 11.5 percent, to $12.30.=20
Earlier Thursday, brokerage house Merrill Lynch & Co. cut its rating on Enro=

Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said with more than $1 bi=

 Enron's standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets."

Credit Suisse Says Citigroup Is Its Top Pick

11/01/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.'s (Z.CSF) research t=
eam covering the brokerage industry said its investment strategy remains "de=
fensive" given the uncertainty that continues to pervade the marketplace.=20
CSFB analyst Joan Solotar recommends investing in the "highest quality/stron=
gest franchise" companies only with a 12 to 18 month time frame in mind beca=
use the stocks could lose some value in the near-term.
Citigroup Inc. (C) is their top pick, Solotar said in a research note, with =
a price target in the mid-50s. The financial services giant was recently tra=
ding up 4 cents, or 0.1%, at $45.40. For investors seeking a purer-play comp=
any in the brokerage arena, she suggests Goldman Sachs (GS), given its "long=
er-term franchise value as well as nearer-term relative market share momentu=
m."=20
"Brokerage stocks have performed surprisingly well in the face of adversity,=
" Solotar said, noting their 9% rise on average in October. "We believe this=
 mostly relates to the assumption by investors that enough fiscal stimulus h=
ad been injected to cause an economic rebound."=20
As a result, Solotar believes the stocks already reflect some amount of earn=
ings recovery.=20
"Our concern rests on the belief that returns next year are not likely to ex=
ceed the low-to-mid teens for most firms, and with book valuation hovering a=
bove two times, there is much room for disappointment," she said, "Add to th=
at the uncertainty surrounding terrorist attacks, and the need to add expens=
es next year in the form of new back-up sites and hot-sites."=20
She doesn't expect to see much demand for investment banking services withou=
t an economic recovery; equity underwriting backlogs now stand at the lower =
end of the recent $18 to $20 billion range. Underwriting levels should remai=
n at current levels, as should merger and acquisition activity, she said in =
the note.=20
Trading volumes are down from their initial surge after September 11, but ar=
e holding steady.=20
"If we believe we may have defined bottom, why are we not more bullish?," So=
lotar said, "While we may project September was bottom, we are not projectin=
g much in the way of recovery any time soon."=20
She said fixed-income business, while relatively stronger than other areas, =
is not providing as much as it was in the first half of the year. Meanwhile,=
 newer problems, such as exposure to Enron Corp. (ENE), create uncertainty. =
Solotar said she doesn't know of any direct exposures to Enron. Enron's shar=
es have tumbled since Oct. 16 when it posted third-quarter charges of $1.01 =
billion. The charges are related to certain investments which were run by fo=
rmer financial chief Andrew Fastow. On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission's inquiry into partnerships head by Fastow moved to an official =
investigation.=20

Enron Obtains $1 Billion in Financing to Bolster Credit Facilities

11/01/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured commitments for an addit=
ional $1 billion in financing from units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citi=
group Inc. as the embattled energy trader moves to supplement its credit fac=
ilities.=20
"This is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor conf=
idence," said Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon. "We are moving =
aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment gra=
de credit rating."
Enron has seen its stock price plummet in a selloff sparked by a loss of inv=
estor confidence in the company following big third-quarter write-downs and =
the disclosure of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In m=
orning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares were down =
$1.67, or 12%, to $12.23. The stock has declined from a 52-week high of $84.=
88.=20
Enron's new financing is secured by its Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwe=
stern Pipeline Co. assets.=20
The financing news comes a day after the SEC elevated to a formal investigat=
ion its inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with partnerships headed by =
its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. A formal investigation in=
volves the SEC's enforcement branch going to the five-member commission and =
obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry.=20
Enron last week disclosed that the SEC had contacted the company as part of =
what it described as an informal inquiry into the Fastow-related partnership=
s. At the time, Enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would coopera=
te fully with the SEC -- a position the company has restated repeatedly sinc=
e.=20
In turn, Enron named William Power a director and head of a four-member comm=
ittee to look into the Fastow-related transactions and other matters. Power =
is dean of the University of Texas School of Law.=20
Enron has consistently said its dealings with the Fastow-connected partnersh=
ips were legal and properly disclosed to investors. According to Enron filin=
gs with the SEC, the company did deals involving billions of dollars of asse=
ts and Enron stock with entities related to the Fastow partnerships. Interna=
l partnership documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and possibly others made mi=
llions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow, who was replaced as chi=
ef financial officer by Mr. McMahon last week, has consistently declined to =
be interviewed.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) electronic trading system, EnronO=
nline.com, saw 7,100 transactions Wednesday by early evening, company spokes=
man Eric Thode said.
A handful more deals were expected Wednesday evening because some products t=
rade 24 hours a day.=20
As in the past two weeks, the volume of transactions Wednesday exceeded the =
30-day average volume of about 5,600 daily transactions.=20
"It's been above average for a while," Thode said, due to "people balancing =
portfolios heading into winter and because of the volatility in the gas and =
power markets."=20
Some industry sources have speculated that EnronOnline volumes may be higher=
 than normal because counterparties are busy flattening their positions with=
 Enron because of questions of Enron's creditworthiness. EnronOnline isn't a=
n exchange. It's a vehicle for customers that want to execute trades with En=
ron. Enron is the counterparty for all deals done there.=20
"Because we know people's transactions and their portfolio with us, we know =
that is not the case. It is business as usual," Thode said.=20
Trading volumes are normally lower at the beginning of new months, Thode sai=
d. Wednesday was effectively part of November for over-the-counter energy ma=
rkets, where spot trades are for next-day delivery. The last day of trading =
for November forward power contracts was Tuesday.=20
EnronOnline trading volume at the beginning of September, said Thode, was pr=
obably in the low to mid 5,000 range, which was well below Wednesday's numbe=

Enron stock price plunges again
By JUAN A. LOZANO

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Troubled Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured $1 billion =
in new financing, using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral. B=
ut its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover =
speculation.=20
In afternoon trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares w=
ere down 9.3 percent, or $1.29 a share, at $12.61.
After dropping to a nine-year low on Tuesday, shares of the nation's largest=
 natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent Wednesday amid speculation t=
he Houston-based company was a takeover candidate.=20
But after the stock market closed for the day, Enron announced the Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission had opened a formal investigation into possible co=
nflicts of interest.=20
The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led =
by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out las=
t month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements.=20
On Thursday, Enron announced its investment bankers had arranged for $1 bill=
ion in fresh credit lines that it planned to use partly to refinance maturin=
g debts.=20
"This is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor conf=
idence," said Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's new chief financial officer. "We are =
moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investm=
ent grade credit rating."=20
Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by Universi=
ty of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigati=
on. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors.=20
"I have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightl=
y investors' questions and concerns," said Enron chairman and chief executiv=
e Kenneth L. Lay. "We will also make every appropriate public disclosure dur=
ing the course of the SEC's investigation."=20
However, Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. in New =
York, said Enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence.=20
"With (stock) values this low, you've got two camps of investors: guys that =
hate Enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to Enron," Grubert =
said. "It's led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being=
 oversold. It's not something the company wants."=20
Enron's stock has skidded since the company reported a $638 million third qu=
arter loss just over two weeks ago, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.=
01 billion attributed to various losses. Some of these losses have been tied=
 to partnerships managed by Fastow, who was ousted last week.=20
Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's long-t=
erm debt and warned of possible further downgrades.=20
Since reporting its disappointing third quarter, Enron had been negotiating =
to establish new credit lines.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in Houston, said Wed=
nesday's stock price surge, after two weeks of selling, was likely a reactio=
n to a The Wall Street Journal report on rumors of a possible takeover of En=
ron.=20
Others might have been buying figuring the stock had hit bottom, she said.=20
On Tuesday, Enron's stock closed at $11.16, its lowest level since 1992.=20
Potential buyers include General Electric's GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett'=
s Berkshire Hathaway and Royal Dutch Shell, the Journal said.=20

Enron Misled Investors about Overvalued Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Deals -=
- ENE

11/01/2001
PrimeZone Media Network
Copyright (c) 2001 PrimeZone Media Network, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1, 2001 (PRIMEZONE) -- The law firm of Berger & Montague,=
 P.C. (http://www.bergermontague.com) filed a class action suit on behalf of=
 an investor against Enron Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE:ENE) and i=
ts principal officers and directors in the United States District Court for =
the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purc=
hased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through and inc=
luding October 18, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The complaint alleges that Enron and its principal officers and directors vi=
olated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and S=
EC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by=
 reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused=
 writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of =
hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relations=
hips with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of s=
hareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by failing to disclose=
 the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which =
include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of i=
ts shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be art=
ificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters w=
ere disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Compan=
y's stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low=
 of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the C=

Enron Gets New Bank Loans But Its Bonds Fall Further
By Joe Niedzielski
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/01/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Word that Enron Corp. (ENE) had secured $1 billion in=
 fresh funds Thursday did little to soothe prices on the company's outstandi=
ng debt securities.=20
Similar to other companies like Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) that have face=
d short-term liquidity issues this year, Enron was forced to put up its asse=
ts in order to secure the financing. And the new bank facilities leapfrogged=
 in front of other creditors like senior unsecured lenders.
The Houston-based energy and trading company said in a statement Thursday th=
at the new financing is supported by Enron's Northern Natural Gas Company an=
d Transwestern Pipeline Company assets. JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney we=
re co-arrangers on the credit lines.=20
Enron plans to use the proceeds to supplement short-term liquidity and to re=
finance maturing obligations. The new $1 billion of secured credit lines wit=
h the more than $1 billion in cash currently on the balance sheet "will furt=
her solidify Enron's standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energ=
y markets," Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, said =
in the statement.=20
But the need to pledge assets to get the credit lines shows caution on the p=
art of lenders that's understandable given Enron's situation, said Susan Abb=
ott, a managing director in corporate finance at Moody's Investors Service.=20
"It signals the fact that the people with the money are not confident enough=
 to trust the general corporate creditworthiness of the entity they're loani=
ng money to," Abbott said. Still, by securing the $1 billion, Enron avoided =
a negative signal that it couldn't secure financing, she said.=20
Moody's lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating Monday =
to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp=
=2E, with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a triple-B-plus rating an=
d it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last week.=20
Questions Remain=20

Traders and bondholders aren't convinced that the new money will be enough. =
Enron has yet to post information on its balance sheet with the Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission. And late Wednesday it disclosed that the SEC elevate=
d to a formal investigation its inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with=
 partnerships headed by its former CEO, Andrew Fastow.=20
Some market participants remain concerned over the lack of disclosure over E=
nron's off-balance sheet financing vehicles.=20
One bank loan officer in New York also cited concerns over the amount of tra=
de receivable and physical settlement obligations Enron may have upcoming in=
 its energy trading business.=20
Abbott at Moody's said the main question is whether Enron's trading counterp=
arties will tighten credit requirements. Other liquidity needs for Enron, sh=
e said, are a matter of whether the markets are demanding additional collate=
ral.=20
Earlier Thursday, Enron's bonds were down about three to four points after t=
rading up Wednesday by as much as five points. Enron bonds that come due in =
2005 were quoted just shy of 78 cents on the dollar, while Enron paper that =
matures in 2009 was bid at around 76 cents. Shorter-term paper that comes du=
e in 2003 was bid slightly higher at 77 cents on the dollar.=20
Enron bank debt has also fallen this week. A five-year revolving loan facili=
ty is quoted in the high 70s, while a 364-day facility, part of $3 billion i=
n loan facilities that Enron drew down on last week, was quoted at around 90=
 cents on the dollar, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York.=20
In addition, the credit default swap market, where participants can buy prot=
ection against defaults or other credit events like loan restructurings, is =
displaying signs of distress in the Enron name. Those willing to sell Enron =
protection this week have demanded some of the premium, or "points" up front=
, to go into the trade.=20
Usually, trades in credit default swaps are initially unfunded, with premium=
s paid on a quarterly or semiannual basis, similar to a company's interest p=
ayments on its bonds.=20
The cost is also higher to write protection over the next year than it is fo=
r protection that covers the next three years. Traders say this indicates th=
ere are concerns over Enron's obligations coming due.=20
Recent quotes for credit protection on Enron call for buyers to pay 12% to 1=
5% of the notional amount of the contract up front, with the annual premium =
for one-year protection at around 15%. Enron's credit curve then slopes down=
ward with three-year protection offered at around 11%.=20
Enron's stock was down $1.33 at $12.57 in early afternoon trade.=20

Enron Gets $1 Bln Loan to Boost Cash, Credit Rating (Update3)
2001-11-01 11:40 (New York)

Enron Gets $1 Bln Loan to Boost Cash, Credit Rating (Update3)

     (Adds possibility of additional loans in 12th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, received a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. after agreeing to use the
company's natural-gas pipelines as collateral.

     Proceeds will go for debt payments and to supplement Enron's
short-term cash reserves. Assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas
Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co. will secure the loan.

     The financing comes a day after Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission is formally investigating
partnerships run by its former chief financial officer. Using the
pipelines as collateral signals Enron's desperation to reassure
shareholders and trading partners that it is creditworthy,
investors said.

     ``Its not reassuring, it's worrisome,'' said Donald Coxe,
manager of the Harris Insight Equity Fund, which owns about 78,000
Enron shares. ``If they had to secure the loan, obviously the
lenders don't think they can rely on Enron's financial
statements.''

     Shares of Enron fell $1.35, or 9.7 percent, to $12.55 in late
morning trading. Earlier, they dropped to $11.47. Before today,
the shares had fallen 83 percent this year.

     Enron's shares fell 52 percent last month amid an SEC inquiry
into partnerships headed by Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief
financial officer, that cost $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity. A formal SEC investigation began yesterday.

     ``It seems until we know more about the SEC investigation,
it's going to be a difficult time for the stock,'' said Tara
Gately, an energy analyst at Loomis Sayles & Co., which sold most
of its Enron shares early last year.

                      Pipeline as Collateral

     Enron, based in Houston, got its start as a gas-pipeline
company. In the past decade, Chairman Kenneth Lay has transformed
the company into the biggest trader of electricity, natural gas,
forest products and other commodities. Enron accounts for about a
quarter of U.S. power and natural gas trades.

     Northern Natural Gas, Enron's largest pipeline, has
approximately 16,500 miles of pipeline from the Permian Basin in
Texas to the Great Lakes. Transwestern Pipeline spans about 2,500
miles.

     Since the SEC began its inquiry, concerns about shaky
finances have prevented Enron from selling commercial paper, or
short-term IOUs. The financing is to ``enhance market and investor
confidence,'' Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said
in a statement.

     ``We are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating'' McMahon said.

     Enron can borrow another $200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan, spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``We don't have any
plans to do so at this point,'' she said.

                           Credit Rating

     On Monday, Moody's Investors Service lowered Enron's long-
term credit rating to ``Baa2'' from ``Baa1,'' two notches above
junk status. It also placed the company's ``P-2'' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     Falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for affiliated companies Enron formed to buy its assets such
as power plants. The affiliates plan to repay borrowed money by
selling the assets. Enron might have to repay any difference
between what the assets sell for and the underlying debt.

     J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of part of its
Azurix North America water business to American Water Works Inc.
for $148.8 million in cash and assumed debt. Salomon Smith Barney
is the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.


BG India: To Extend Enron Oil, Gas Field Operator Talks

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) said Thu=
rsday it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the India=
n upstream assets of Enron Corp. (ENE) acquired by BG for US$388 million in =
early October.=20

0909GMT
A disagreement between BG and Enron Corp.'s former joint venture partners - =
state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.=
REL) - soon after BG acquired Enron Corp.'s upstream India assets threatened=
 to scuttle the deal.=20
BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field =
and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field was being challenged by the two other =
partners which jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets.=20
BG made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright =
operatorship by Oct. 31.=20
But in a statement issued Thursday, BG India Vice President Nigel Shaw indic=
ated talks between the three parties were positive and ONGC and that Relianc=
e Industries could reach an agreement.=20
"We are making good progress and will continue discussions with ONGC and Rel=
iance to reach agreement for BG India to operate these assets. We believe th=
at this proposal is advantageous and is in the interests of the partnership,=
" Shaw said.=20
BG India said it expects to continue discussions over the "coming weeks" and=
 "will make an announcement in due course." The statement didn't specify the=
 extended length of the negotiations.=20
The Indian government wants ONGC and Reliance to have first option on the op=
eratorship, which was being pursued by both companies, according to Indian n=
ewspaper reports in October.=20
BG has portrayed its purchase of Enron Oil and Gas Ltd., or EOGIL, as signif=
icant as it raises its upstream profile, by boosting the group's global hydr=
ocarbon production by up to 7%, and diversifying its distribution and pipeli=
ne interests in the fast-growing Indian energy market.=20

Susanta Mazumdar, a Bombay-based energy analyst with UBS Warburg (U.UBS) sai=
d BG India's bid for operator status would continue to face stiff resistance=
 from ONGC and Reliance.=20
"Both ONGC and Reliance may not give up that easily. There is a strong corpo=
rate incentive to get operator status. BG India may have to give some conces=
sions in other fields in return for operator status," Mazumdar said.=20
At the time of writing, ONGC and Reliance Industries declined to comment on =
BG India's move to extend the operatorship talks.=20
About 0932 GMT, BG Group shares were up 6.25 pence at 266.50 pence on the Lo=
ndon Stock Exchange.=20

Top officials of IDBI and ICICI met officials in the Finance and Power minis=

"We discussed Enron. The discussions are continuing and we are examining var=

He said the FIs, which have a total exposure of over Rs 62 billion in the pr=

 frame for it.=20
Earlier in the day, Vora met Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha to apprise him =
about the situation.=20
FIs had decided to come up with a solution by Oct 31 for the second phase of=

India: SCI to inject more funds into Greenfield Shipping

11/01/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyri=
ght (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd
NEW DELHI, Oct. 31 AFTER several rounds of discussions and consultations wit=
hin its board and with the Ministry of Shipping, the Shipping Corporation of=
 India (SCI) has finally decided to pump in $ 13 million as additional inves=
tment in Greenfield Shipping Company to part-fund the gap in project cost of=
 $ 55 million for building an LNG tanker for transporting gas to Dabhol Powe=
r Company.=20
"The Shipping Ministry has given its in-principle approval to SCI for invest=
ing an extra $ 13 million in Greenfield which will be in the form of a loan =
to the company and not as extra equity. The additional investment by SCI wou=
ld not require clearance from the Union Cabinet," Government sources told Bu=
siness Line.
Though the additional investment of $ 55 million is to be shared equally by =
the three promoters of Greenfield in proportion to their equity holdings, th=
is proposition has gone awry due to the fact that one of the promoters, Enro=
n-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc with a 20 per cent stake, has clearly sa=
id no to putting its share of extra funds.=20
In fact, Atlantic Commercial Inc.is understood to have expressed a desire to=
 exit from Greenfield by selling its equity worth $ 11 million and the swap =
cost of $ 19 million.=20
Consequently, the extra investment of Atlantic Commercial Inc of $ 11 millio=
n is being shared by the other two partners - SCI and Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. =
Lines - apart from their own share of the additional cost in proportion to t=
heir equity holdings of 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively.=20
So, SCI will put in an additional $ 13 million comprising its share of $ 11 =
million and $ 2 million of Atlantic Commercial's share. Whereas, MOL will pu=
mp-in an additional $ 42 million including its share of $ 33 million and $ 9=
 million of Atlantic's share.=20
The additional investment by the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company ha=
s become necessary after the bankers to the LNG shipping deal led by ANZ Inv=
estment Bank had suspended disbursement of the last tranche of the project l=
oan of $ 55 million, citing an event of default.=20
The additional investment made by SCI and MOL will take the form of a loan t=
o Greenfield which would enable the Company to take possession of the LNG ta=
nker on the scheduled delivery date of November 15.=20
Greenfield was formed for owning an operating a 137,000 cubic metre capacity=
 tanker for transporting LNG to Enron-promoted Dabhol power plant. The tanke=
r is ready for delivery at the yard of Mitsubishi, Japan.=20
The promoters are negotiating with Oman LNG to deploy the LNG tanker 'LNG La=
xmi' till the LNG terminal of Dabhol goes on stream.=20

Enron and the curse of Drexel=20
Commentary: Energy trader's friends dry up
By David Callaway <<mailto:dcallaway@marketwatch.com>>, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:15 AM ET Nov. 1, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- It was the master of its universe.

Its employees were rich, young and ruthless. It treated its clients and riva=
ls alike, with disdain. Its leader counseled business tycoons and political =
powerbrokers alike. And when the bottom finally fell out, it didn't have a f=
riend in the world to save it.=20

Wall Street loves a success story. But it loves a success story gone wrong e=
ven more. Such was the case for Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond empire=
 of the 1980s, whose spiritual leader Michael Milken orchestrated one of the=
 greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of=
 federal investigations, losses and the largest bankruptcy in Wall Street hi=
story.=20

For Enron, the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than =
two-thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial tran=
sactions and its stability, the similarities are striking.=20

Like Drexel, Enron set out to change an industry. Like Drexel, it succeeded,=
 for a while. Under the guidance of Chairman Ken Lay, Enron evolved from a b=
ackwater Texas natural-gas pipeline company to become the nation's largest e=
nergy merchant.=20

Its EnronOnline business transformed the way energy trading was done and fun=
neled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in=
 last two years. The aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a pro=
fit at all costs made millionaires of many employees, while those who were n=
ot deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms, no questions asked.=
 Enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry.=20

For his part, Lay became an international corporate celebrity, advising Pres=
ident Bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with Vice President Dick C=
heney on the administration's controversial energy plan earlier this year.=20

But Enron's attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and it=
s secretive financial structure finally got the best of it. The unexplained =
resignation of its chief executive in August, the ouster of its chief financ=
ial officer last week and the company's inability to prove its financial hea=
lth have prompted investors to bail out of Enron stock like jackrabbits esca=
ping a brushfire.=20

Now Lay & Co. are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical Wall Street tha=
t is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place (=
sound familiar?). Takeover speculation gave Enron shares a boost Wednesday, =
helping it end a 10-day losing streak. But it's unlikely anyone is going to =
step into this mess before a Securities and Exchange Commission investigatio=
n into its finances yields a few more answers.=20

For investors, a short-term rally beyond the jump Wednesday is still possibl=
e now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares. But at a clos=
ing price of $13.90, Enron shares are more than a Texas mile from their 52-w=
eek high of $84.88 last December.=20

For Enron itself, it's time to put its cards on the table with regulators an=
d Wall Street. As the Drexel saga showed, a strategy of defiance to the end =
only hastens the end.=20
