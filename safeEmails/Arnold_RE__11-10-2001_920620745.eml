Not so impressed with David goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivative=
s for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial d=
erivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyon=
nais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a=
 while and might have some knowledge as to how they work. =20
