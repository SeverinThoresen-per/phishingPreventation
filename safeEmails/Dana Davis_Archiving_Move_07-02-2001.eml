Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be=20
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the=20
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to=20
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room=
=20
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project=20
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go=20
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please=20
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I=20
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.
