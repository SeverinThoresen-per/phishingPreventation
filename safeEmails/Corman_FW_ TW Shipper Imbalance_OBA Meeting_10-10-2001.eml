	Shelley, we have established Monday afternoon after Steve Harris' staff
	meeting to meet and discuss:

		1.  TW Shipper Imbalance Status

		2.  OBA termination/Resolution=20

	We will stay in the conference room on 13.

	Just wanted to let you know this is replacing our Tuesday morning meeting
	which was not working well since everyone moved.

	Thanks. Lynn
