I have reviewed the documents you forwarded to me and have the following=20
comments:

1.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Glencore Ltd. and Enron=
=20
Fuels International, Inc. - =20
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  "The total cost of=
=20
such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Seller and=20
Owner."

2.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Enron Fuels=20
International, Inc. and Empresa Energetica Corinto Ltd. -
 Page 6 - first line of 7.1 (b) the number of days should be changed from=20
"20" to "21".
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.1 should read as follows:  "Any costs of=20
testing at the loading port shall be borne by Seller's supplier."
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  "The total cost of=
=20
such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Buyer and=20
Seller's supplier."
 Page 21 - Insert the following sentence immediately prior to the last=20
sentence of 21.1:  "In the event Seller's Affiliate withdraws from the Buyer=
=20
or the Project, (i) this Agreement shall immediately terminate and (ii) Buye=
r=20
(as purchaser thereunder) shall enter into a direct agreement with Seller's=20
supplier (as seller thereunder) on the same terms and conditions as this=20
Agreement, except Buyer shall provide such security as requested by Seller's=
=20
supplier."

3.   Indemnification letter agreement - appears to be okay as reflected in=20
the redlined draft.  Please prepare on EI letterhead.

4.  Option Agreement - The purpose of this agreement is unclear.  The=20
agreements are assignable to affiliates; however, if a new fuel affiliate is=
=20
set up to take EFI out of the supply arrangements, EFI will not continue to=20
provide technical, accounting, management and other support without adequate=
=20
compensation, nor is EFI willing to give up its rights to transfer the=20
agreements to any other EFI affiliate.  I see no purpose for the Option=20
Agreement, please delete.
