	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and=
 see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question. =20

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do =
not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contrac=
t
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract =3D Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ.=20
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated =
on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the sh=
ipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything o=
ver will be=20
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
