Why do these reports have to be done before the 8:00 a.m. meeting. This has =
not been the procedure in the past.  If these numbers are asked for in the m=
orning meeting, they can be quickly obtained or the previous days numbers ar=
e available. =20

We need to complete the Oneok Recap and the Bushton (PVR) file, before the 8=
:00 A.M. Meeting, EACH DAY.

I asked to create a Bushton Group to assist our team in completing the Busht=
on file.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Robert
