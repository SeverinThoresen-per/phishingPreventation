I am proposing the following language be inserted in the Password=20
Applications for all Latin American counterparties who want to trade online.=
 =20
I would appreciate your comments.   I will run the issue by Richard Sanders=20
or Michelle Cash as well.

"For the purpose the Password Application, the ETA, the GTC and any=20
Transaction, Counterparty appoints as its Process Agent,=20
_______________________________, having an office in=20
___________________________ (specify city in the United States) on the date=20
of this Agreement at ___________________________________________ (specify=20
address in the United States)."
If you approve of the language I will have the EOL team place this in the=20
Password Applications.
Thanks,
Brent
