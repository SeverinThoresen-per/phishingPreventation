Ozzie:

As a follow up to our phone conversation, how about scheduling the Ft. Pierc=
e project review meeting during the second week in April?   The objective of=
 the meeting is to look at the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation=
 measures we taking.   The intended outcome is to ensure all related Enron e=
ntities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to as=
k questions.  This will reduce the chance that we will run into objections d=
own the road on "technical risks" as we begin to ramp up our capital commitm=
ents.  We had a similar meeting with the Electrobolt team in Enron S. Americ=
a, that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives.

Do you have a project presentation that you (and/or the lead developer) coul=
d discuss with the above team?   As many of the technical risk issues are al=
so tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas a=
s well (e.g., commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical de=
sign and implementation strategy).

One of the key aspects of the project to discuss is the schedule risk and ou=
r strategy for securing a capable construction contractor for the job.  Let =
me know as to your availability, and who else you think should attend the me=
eting.

Thanks,
Brian
