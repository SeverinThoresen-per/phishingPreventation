I am comfortable with the Allegheny credit - my understanding is that they a=
re getting a sweetheart deal on the assets being transferred from their regu=
lated utility so they will be in a buying mode for quite some time - in fact=
 they are a good candidate for buying this but I did not want to disrupt the=
 negotiations by bringing up the equity sale. =20

Regarding Turbopark, this project on its own could go into Turbopark (we are=
 using their form of EPC), but because this is linked to a Fair Market Value=
 QF, accounting is not comfortable using it (it risks our favourable Arthur =
Anderson treatment on all of our FMV assets)   We have assumed in our econom=
ics that the bridge loan is priced at 15%.  =20

The Allegheny toll, and all development contracts are a CP to this deal - th=
is needs to be perfectly nailed down prior to pulling the trigger!

Have a good time ski-ing.

If you catch this before you go - are we happy with the Allegheny credit?   =
 I take it that you just don't meet the terms of  Turbopark - what is the co=
st of the bridge loan? I assume Allengheny toll is a CP on going forward wit=
h this deal. =20

Subject:	Update

Turbine Swap:  We are providing the final definitive agreement to Delta toda=
y.  We have received and incorporated their comments.  Based on this, they a=
re supposed to fund on April 20.  The lawyers are planning to meet early nex=
t week to review any final/new comments and closing process.  I am talking w=
ith Dean Vanech on a different matter so I will nudge him along as well.

I am out tomorrow - skiing

Las Vegas:  The development of the expansion is being pulled together and th=
e tolling agreement with Allegheny is nearly complete.  We expect everything=
 to be done later this month.  We would like approval to construct this proj=
ect subject to everything being fialized.  As such, we are hoping to review =
this with you and John Monday, execute a DASH later in the week and seek Exe=
cutive Committee/Board approval on April 30/May 1 for up to $200MM.  We will=
 have a detailed presentation/DASH for your review Monday (RAC, finance, acc=
ounting and legal have seen the DASH and are aware of timing).  In general..=
=2E

- Location:  North Las Vegas, adjacent to existing LM6000 QF facility
- Description: $195MM, 225MW combined cycle LM6000, 7,800 heat rate, COD of =
September 1, 2002
- Interconnect: Nevada Power
- Gas Supply: Southwest Power
- Permits: Done
- EPC Contractor: Modern Continental with Fixed Price turnkey with A-Rated b=
onding (a second tier, but financeable contract)
- Tolling terms: 15 year, Allegheny delivers fuel to plant, and takes power =
from plant, $12.15/kwmonth plus variable charges =3D $29MM / year
- Returns are > 15% when we believe the asset market needs 10%-12%
- Based on Fountain Valley comparables (discount rates and terminal value as=
sumptions) I think we can make $25MM - $30MM selling this project this year.
- Interested bidders include Black Hills, Northland Power, TransCanada, Delt=
a Power, Calpine
- Turbopark can not be used so Joe and I have agreed to a 120 day bridge loa=
n from Enron until project financing can be secured=20

Wind:  My Wind guys are talking with ENE Wind.  They are concerned that ENE =
Wind may sell to a BPA RFP at a price below EPMI's bid.  They also want to o=
ption a couple of ENE Wind's sites in order to quickly capture opportunities=
 - in general we believe that ENE Wind has some good sites, but does not hav=
e the resources to get them done, so we would like to control the site and b=
ring together companies that want to partner with us (Equity-Cinergy, EPC/O&=
M-Enexco).  We believe that we can pull a deal together that could result in=
 ENE Wind selling more turbines and ENA generating strong marketing premiums=
 without either one of us putting any significant capital at risk.   Mark Me=
tz suggested that anything that can help ENE Wid sell more turbines is a goo=
d thing.  I will talk with him and Adam Umanoff.
