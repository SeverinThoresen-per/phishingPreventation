Hello Mr. Uutella,


I am an analyst working for Enron Industrial Markets in Houston, Texas and I=
 am gathering some information on tissue. I spoke to Rod Young and David Pin=
ault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive=
 studies on tissue usage.=20

What I am looking for are: tissue capacity worldwide and by region (North Am=
erica, Europe, Latin America, Asia)
and the biggest companies that produce tissue.

Can you also include how much this information would cost?

Thanks in advance,
Monika Causholli
