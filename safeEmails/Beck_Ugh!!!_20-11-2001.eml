Tough times - and lots of work.  I know that you must be swamped, and that y=
ou had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget proce=
ss.  I am sure it is even tougher now!

Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.  On Rick's behalf,=
 she was asking about London operations.  I assume that you have covered tha=
t.  Her specific question related to Mike.  I told her that you and I hadn't=
 talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.  Accurate=
? =20


Take care.=20
