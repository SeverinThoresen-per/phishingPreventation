The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA (Transportat=
ion Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply to this imbal=
ance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from usage.  Ent=
er the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the ci=
tygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in=
 ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is res=
ponsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future imbalances =
will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this current TA imba=
lance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Chris
