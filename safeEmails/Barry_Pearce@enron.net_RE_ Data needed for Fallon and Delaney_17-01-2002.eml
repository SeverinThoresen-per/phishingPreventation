Jenny,

Whilst undestanding that you do provide shared services - could you maybe gi=
ve me a little more detail on what areas you support, what offices/locations=
, relationship with NetCo, Wholesale, Pipelines etc...What was your allocati=
on methodology for the 2001 budget?

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) i=
t is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as w=
e are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a f=
wd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

Thanks.

Barry.
