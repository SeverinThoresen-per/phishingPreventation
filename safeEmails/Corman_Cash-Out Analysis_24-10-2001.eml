Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI =
- majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by th=
e volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net =
cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these rea=
lly all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from=
 market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pric=
ing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to g=
et Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.=20
