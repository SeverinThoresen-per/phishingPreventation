How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and EN=
A=20
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do=20
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free=20
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do=
=20
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer=
=20
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give m=
e=20
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstrea=
m=20
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would=
=20
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway. =20

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG,=20
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier. =20

Thanks Chris.
