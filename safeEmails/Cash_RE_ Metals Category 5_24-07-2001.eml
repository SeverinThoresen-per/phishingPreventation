Cathy,

I have been getting this question a lot!

It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, t=
hey will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you ar=
e more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for t=
he next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or somethin=
g to that effect.=20

Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really sh=
ould follow through.

Michelle

Hi Michelle,

For those employees that landed in Category 5 due to misclassification of jo=
b group, is it sufficient to address in the evaluation and not complete a PI=
P?  The employee is by no means performing poorly and presenting her with a =
PIP would be a contradicting message.

Through the process of the PRC, we identified that this particular person wh=
o is a Specialist was really doing an Entry Specialist job and would have fa=
ired fairly well in the lower job group, however because we had them in the =
Specialist job group, she did not fair so well relative to her Specialist pe=
ers.

Just want to make sure I'm not breaking any policy by making this exception.

Thanks,
Cathy
