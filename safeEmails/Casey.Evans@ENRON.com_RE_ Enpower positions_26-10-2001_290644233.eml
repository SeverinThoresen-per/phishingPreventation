Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select "commodity" only=
 as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as the=
y are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should qu=
ery by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (regi=
on codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not =
energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey

1) RisktRAC
2)Yes, except South America is not in EnPower yet.  The portfolio is set up,=
 but no transactions are captured there.
3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA sh=
ould not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective dat=
e 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to gen=
erate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct?=20
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other=
 names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom
