The consent form should be kept in PH file.   The background check results s=
hould be maintained separately.  MHC

Subject:	Background Checks

Unfortunately I was unable to attend the session today regarding background =
checks.  Can you please tell me what we are supposed to do with the original=
 signed consent forms?  I thought we were supposed to shred them, but I was =
told that we are supposed to file them with the original background check re=
port in the PH file.  I know from several of the staffers that today you cla=
rified that we are not supposed to keep the background check reports in the =
PH file, but in a separate file.  I would appreciate your clarification of w=
here the consent forms are to be kept.

Thank you,
