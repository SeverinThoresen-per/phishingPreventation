In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and=20
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal=
=20
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, includin=
g=20
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them. =
=20
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty=20
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly
