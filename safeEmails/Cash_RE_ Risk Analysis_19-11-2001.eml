I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we ha=
ve in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to po=
pulate.  One other field to add would be visa status. =20

As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these document=
s can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting =
for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the gen=
eralist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special ri=
sk factors column.

Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at t=
he direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this docume=
nt if necessary.

Thanks.

I took a shot at combining the two spreadsheets.  Michelle, please provide c=
orrect ethic codes (I just guessed).  Tana, I'll need some help formatting t=
he "Yrs. of Svc." and "Age" columns to calculate after we input date of hire=
 and date of birth.  Comments?

Thanks,
