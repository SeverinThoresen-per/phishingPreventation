Unofficially, according to Transco, NYPA has 4 receipt points on their FT-NT=
=20
contract.  Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035=20
Btu factor.  I can't=20

Point  Volume MCF  dts=20
Henry  12,336   12,768
Mamou  7,849   8,124
Carthage 4,934   5,107
Ada  7,401   7,660  (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone=
=20
1)=20

   Total  33,659

My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts,=20
grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 33,384 dts.  To my=20
knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.

Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half a=
t=20
Henry.  At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around t=
o=20
better suit our needs.

Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.  The only=20
information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed=
=20
up receipt volume.  She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting=

at each point.
