Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple=

just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to=

a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another=20
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's=20
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these=20
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over her=
e=20
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try m=
e=20
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.
