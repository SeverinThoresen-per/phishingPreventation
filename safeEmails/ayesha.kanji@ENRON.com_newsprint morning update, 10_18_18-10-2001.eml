Good Morning Team,

The Orange County Register will eliminate 102 positions of the newspaper's 1=
,749 full time employees on Friday, as a result of decreased circulation and=
 revenue due to weak advertising compounded by the September attacks.  As of=
 March 31, the Register had a daily circulation of 353,334 and a Sunday circ=
ulation of 410,207, with an annual NP consumption of 120,000 MT.
--
Media General reported a 3Q01 loss -- its first quarterly loss in 4 years.  =
``The terrorist attacks of September 11th had an immediate impact on our ear=
nings, and they have exacerbated the economic uncertainty that has caused ma=
ny of our advertisers to remain cautious,'' Chief Executive J. Stewart Bryan=
 III said.  Revenues for 3Q01 were down 4% from the same period in 2000.  Me=
dia General's publishing division, which includes the Richmond Times-Dispatc=
h and the Tampa Tribune, had a revenue decrease of  5.4%.=20
--
Sun Media eliminated 125 more jobs in cost-cutting measures intended to save=
 $10 million annually.  The Quebecor subsidiary - publisher of such major da=
ilies as the Toronto Sun and Le Journal de Montreal - announced it is combin=
ing the business operations of its Bowes Publishing division, which produces=
 over 190 weeklies and community dailies, with those of its metropolitan dai=
lies.  As well, it is ending production of its free Toronto commuter daily, =
FYI Toronto.  The end of FYI Toronto should provide some immediate relief to=
 other Toronto dailies, such as the Toronto Star, and possibly increase dema=
nd for Toronto dailies...
October abounds with job cuts and 3Q01 losses... none of this comes as a sur=
prise in light of the bleak ad market and the negative shock of the Septembe=
r attacks.  As a result, many publishers are looking to cut costs to recover=
 from decreased ad revenues.  If you would like more information on a partic=
ular publisher, I would be happy to oblige.
Ayesha
