Hi,

As requested, here are the details of the hotel nearest the Oslo Enron offic=
e=20
- it is a 5 to 7 minute walk away.

Scandic Hotel Sj>lyst
Sj>lyst plass 5
PO box 173, Sk>yen  phone +47 23 15 50 00
0212 Oslo, Norway  Fax: +47 23 15 50 01

The best way to get there from the airport is to use the Airport Express rai=

service and to SKOYEN.  It goes every 15 minutes and takes about 20 minutes.=

You can get tickets at the airport and everyone speaks English.

Any questions please ask James (as I am on maternity leave from tomorrow).

Thanks,
Teresa
