That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as=20
much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really no=
t=20
too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm stil=
l=20
breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formul=
a=20
so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the hous=
e=20
for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and=20
with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the=20
house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled=
=20
him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in=20
tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few=20
weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probabl=
y=20
because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.

Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although=20
there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to=20
me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we ar=
e=20
sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.

Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if =
I=20
can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear=20
about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more=
=20
what we have.

Have you been doing too much or just not getting any sleep?
