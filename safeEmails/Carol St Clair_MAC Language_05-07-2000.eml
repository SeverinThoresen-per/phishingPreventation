Luanne:
I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part=20
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our=20
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit suppor=
t=20
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one=
=20
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For=20
this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shal=
l=20
fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.=20

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.
