Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a r=
esult, significantly more new transactions are being booked to "New Counterp=
art"  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emph=
asizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is no=
t maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required =
to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of n=
ew counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in c=
onjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next=
 Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must=
 be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID. =
 Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested with=
in the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up t=
he counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and =
map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the lat=
ter severly under resourced). =20

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions execu=
ted now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importa=
ntly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these=
 efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

Regards
Molly

This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
