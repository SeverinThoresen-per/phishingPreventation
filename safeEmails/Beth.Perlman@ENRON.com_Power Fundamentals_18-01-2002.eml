All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  =
The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use withi=
n the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your coopera=
tion is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger =
will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth=20
