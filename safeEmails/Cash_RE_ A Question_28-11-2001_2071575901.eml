I don't think the plan would call for an employee to withdraw from litigatio=
n to be eligible for benefits--just that the employee sign the waiver.  Then=
, I think that in the employee's lawsuit we'd argue that the waiver released=
 the claims and that the claims should be dismissed.

I agree with Michelle.  I'm certain that the releases is designed to release=
 such conduct.

I don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of c=
laims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms o=
f our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.

Terrie, Cole; I'm forwarding these to Michelle.  Michelle, my view:  1.  Emp=
loyees who qualify to the 401K class, may exercise their rights without risk=
ing their severance.   The severance waiver is not a universal surrender of =
rights to bring claims.   Regards, Rj.      =20

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, b=

 scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will tha=
t affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver a=
s part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareho=
lder class action suite against Enron.
