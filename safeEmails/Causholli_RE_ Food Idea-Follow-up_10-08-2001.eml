oncert and what time is good for us to have the dinner?

I mentioned the following idea to Vikram.  The Gispy Kings are playing out a=
t the Woodlands Pavilion on August 26 (it is a Sunday)  and I was thinking i=
t might be nice if we got together beforehand and had the potluck and then w=
e could all go to the show, assuming their music is within everyone's taste =
and liking.  (Given the heavy weighting of the Latin contingent, I suspect i=
t may be.)  Anyway, lawn seats are only $17, so it is also pretty affordable=
=2E  Dave and I both live out there, and I would be happy to host the potluc=
k before hand in the afternoon at my house, or if Dave is willing we could m=
ake it a pool party,and get him off to a good start with all of his new neig=
hbors by being really loud in his back yard.  Any thoughts?

PS  I'm out of town this coming weekend.

Elizabeth

Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together somepl=
ace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or an=
ything else that you want to cook, including desserts.=20

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when=
 you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is b=
ringing the main dish, salads, and desserts.=20

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cul=
tural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika
