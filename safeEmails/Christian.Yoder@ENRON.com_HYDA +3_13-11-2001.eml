Hall Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 12, 2001:   +3

A number of relatively positive factors are offset by the single negative fa=
ctor that the good old days are forever gone. The free fall seems to have en=
ded.   Lots of cash is coming in.  Portland office is apparently to be spare=
d a misery that  Houston will not be so fortunate as to escape,  and is give=
n a clear message to resume work as usual.  Street Oracle  carping and whini=
ng at low level of hysteria.  =20

Perhaps a key subliminal message can be divined from the fact that Tim went =
to Houston carrying  full documentation and prepared to hand in all of his e=
xpense reports, but came back without having turned anything in at all,   fl=
ying back home on the jetstream,  much like the single crow that sailed by t=
oday,  heading due north high above the center of the Willamette, as though =
it knew exactly where it was going.  =20
