Here is Rick's response - sounds more like a concern on his part on losing p=

Sally- got your voice mail as well. Don't want to create more meetings. Just=
 had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said =
one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues =
that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk. I thin=
k it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are ident=
ified. It may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested. I need to=
 hear what the nature of the problems are. Some I know like ees, metals, uk =
power but I think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hinder=
ing progress here. No need for you to attend. I will let you know what we co=
me up with including if there are no issues at all! Rick

Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I woul=
d like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues"=
=2E  My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk an=
d we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives t=
hat vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to hav=

I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing p=
roblems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. =
I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operationa=
l issues as well.=20

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the R=
AC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Thanks, Rick
