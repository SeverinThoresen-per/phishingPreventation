Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this a=
nd he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern ro=
cks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed =
methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" ei=
ther ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Al=
so, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associ=
ated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed m=
ethane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope =
this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Chris

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for weste=
rn Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shu=
t-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge o=
f presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What =
do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as s=
imple as gathering and processing? =20

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Grigsby
