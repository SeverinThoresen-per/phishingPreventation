Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your=20
records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1=20
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery=20
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be=20
somewhere around $16.00.
