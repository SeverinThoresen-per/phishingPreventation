Just hope you hadn't flaked out yet.

How was East/West Texas this past weekend?? I bet it was extremely hot.

I got the okay on bringing the cat up here!!! Only $250 cat deposit.

If you are in town next Sunday, September 10th. We are having a BBQ, "going
away" thing at my pool around 4 pm. I do need you to come by before we leave
on Friday, September 15th... to get a packing strategy... I think I'm good
to go... but since you have more experience at this... I'll take your
advice.

Thanks.
