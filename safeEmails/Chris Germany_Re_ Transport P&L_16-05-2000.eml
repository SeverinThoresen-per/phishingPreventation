We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been=20

I need to know WHY you all are still uncomfortable using the service p&l, at=

Colleen,

The main reason I am uncomfortable about using the service p&l is because=20
Chris, Dan, and Judy are uncomfortable with it.  As soon as they are happy=20
with it, we are ready to use it.

What system resources are you talking about?

Colleen,

I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris ha=
s=20
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto=20
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still no=
t=20
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next=20
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved an=
d=20
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.

Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market=
=20
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not=20
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are=
=20
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee,=20
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand=20
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the=20
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East=20
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG=
,=20
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to=20
make sense to me.  Please advise.
