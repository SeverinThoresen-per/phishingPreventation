India's finance minister says the country is open for business, but delayed=20

Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha promised earlier this year he would=20
"walk the talk" on liberalizing the country's famously protectionist foreign=
=20

Five months on, he's clearly proud of his accomplishments. Too proud. "The=20

attention to foreign direct investment," Sinha said in an interview. "An=20
investor-friendly policy regime has been put in place with foreign investmen=
t=20

Sinha initially won applause from foreign investors for introducing a progra=
m=20
that included key privatization initiatives and select sector foreign direct=

investment liberalization. But the minister has stumbled recently on four ke=
y=20
deals.=20
The main privatization targets for this year -- state flag carrier Air-India=
=20
Ltd., car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd. and local telecom giant Videsh Sanchar=20
Nigam Ltd. -- all remain unsold.=20
And Enron Corp.'s long-troubled effort to make a profit from its $3 billion=20
investment in a 65%-owned power plant in the state of Maharashtra -- the=20
largest foreign investment in India -- has hit a brick wall. The Houston=20
power company moved in May to abandon its decade-long effort after repeated=20
run-ins with the state government over unpaid bills.=20
For corporate dealmakers, India continues to tempt and disappoint. With a=20
population of 1 billion and an emerging middle class, the prospect of a=20
reforming, open Indian economy fascinates foreign companies in the way China=
=20
did in the 1990s.=20
The only problem is the government's inability to implement its rhetoric on=20
reform. Sinha described the reform process as "irreversible." However, he=20
said the country was following a "calibrated" approach to "allow the economy=
=20
enough time to absorb the impact of restructuring." But calibrated to what?=20
No foreign groups, for example, were among the bidders expressing interest i=
n=20
the 25% stake in Videsh Sanchar Nigam the national government is selling.=20
India's tangled telecom regulations made a bid far too problematic.=20
New Delhi's effort to sell 40% of Air-India is also freighted with red tape.=

First off, the government is offering only 26% to a foreign carrier. This le=
d=20
Delta Air Lines Inc. of the U.S. and Air France, which were planning a joint=

bid, to drop out of the race.=20
That cleared the path for a bid by Singapore Airlines Inc. in partnership=20
with the local Tata group, the original owners of the nationalized air=20
carrier. But what is a minority stake in perpetually money-losing Air-India=20
worth? SIA and Tata could well balk if New Delhi asks too much.=20
Then there is the government's 50% stake in Maruti Udyog. Joint venture=20
partner Suzuki Motor Corp. has the first right of refusal on the government'=

way off. This would make the issue "forever and after the epitome of lost=20
privatization opportunities," says Udayan Bose, chairman and CEO of Lazard=20
India.=20
Sinha's response? "The government appointed a committee on March 26 to=20
negotiate with Suzuki. The committee has commenced formal negotiations with=20
Suzuki."=20
To be fair, Sinha has one piece of reform of which to be proud. Passage of=20
legislation liberalizing the insurance sector last year was his major triump=

and a landmark for global insurance giants.=20
Standard Life Assurance Co. and Prudential Corp. plc of Britain, as well as=20
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and American International Group Inc. of the=

Sinha says the reforms will triple the size of the local insurance market=20
within three years.=20
Sinha predicts other victories soon.=20
"We have already taken the decision to privatize 27 public sector companies,=
"=20
he said. "In most of these cases, the process is on. We have streamlined=20
procedures, and it is our duty to convince the people of this country and=20
Parliament that the process is transparent."=20
Still, the privatizations of Air-India, Maruti Udyog and VSNL mean the=20
government's $2.3 billion sales target for this year is clearly in trouble.=20
And recent overall FDI figures are not encouraging, either. According to the=
=20
Reserve Bank of India, approval was granted for FDI of $55.1 billion between=
=20
1991 and 1998, but only $12 billion was actually invested.=20
India's infamous bureaucracy turned many potential investors away. But also=20
of concern is the economy. GDP growth, which many regard as inflated by=20

GM, Other U.S. Companies Blast Bush Move to Shield Steelmakers
2001-06-07 00:01 (New York)


     Washington, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. is
concerned that an investigation President George W. Bush ordered
of foreign steel in the U.S. may lead to import curbs, pushing up
prices for the cars and trucks it sells consumers.
     Stripmatic Products Inc., a Cleveland company with 30
employees that supplies brake components to GM and other
automakers, has a deeper worry: If it's forced to buy more
expensive U.S. steel, it may lose all its customers.
     ``If they put on import tariffs, I will lose my business to
overseas manufacturers,'' said Stripmatic President Bill Adler,
whose 55-year-old company imports low-grade stainless steel
exclusively from a French manufacturer.
     GM, the world's largest automaker, and Stripmatic were among
the U.S. steel-consuming companies that blasted Bush's Tuesday
order, warning it may cost money and jobs in the $37 billion U.S.
steel industry.
     ``Imported steel has the effect of keeping a dampener on
prices,'' said Bill Noak, a General Motors spokesman.
     Bush told the International Trade Commission, a U.S. agency,
to look into whether steel imports were harming domestic
producers, a step that may clear the way for remedies such as
tariffs, import curbs or an outright ban on the foreign products.
     The president responded to pressure from U.S. steelmakers
such as LTV Corp., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Weirton Steel Corp.,
which have been lobbying for import protection since 1998, when a
flood of foreign metal sent steel prices and profits plunging.
     Since 1998, 18 U.S. steel companies, including LTV, the
country's second largest, filed for bankruptcy.

                      Pushing for Protection

     The U.S. industry has lost 80 percent of its jobs in the last
two decades, and steelmakers and steelworkers mostly blame
imports, which now take up about 27 percent of the U.S. market,
the world's largest.
     They charge that unfair trade practices, including government
subsidies that allow companies from South Korea to Brazil to sell
steel in the U.S. below the cost of production, have made it
impossible to compete on price.
     A metric ton of structural steel used in high-rise buildings
cost about $615 in the U.S. at the end of last year -- and $275 in
Russia, according to the International Cost Engineering Council, a
nonprofit group.
     Bush backed that contention when he said the U.S. industry
has been ``affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign government
intervention in the market.''
     ``All we've ever asked for is a fair and level playing
field,'' said Daniel Dimicco, president of Charlotte-based Nucor
Corp., a ``mini-mill'' that makes steel by melting scrap and was
the most profitable domestic steelmaker last year. ``That is the
message the president is sending, and we support it.''

                       8 Million Workers

     Officials from companies that consume steel in the U.S.
contend that such protection would cost the U.S. far more than the
steel industry would gain.
     About 8 million Americans are employed by steel-consuming
industries -- including auto and appliance makers, construction
companies and energy companies, according to the Consuming
Industries Trade Action Coalition, a group of steel consumers
including Caterpillar Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and Enron Corp.
     Steel producers employ about 160,000 people, down from
800,000 20 years ago.
     An April study by the coalition examined the effect of steel
import quotas and tariffs and found that manufacturers using steel
would be forced to cut jobs because of higher costs. That would
result in an overall loss of between 19,000 and 32,000 jobs, while
protecting only about 3,700 steelworker jobs.
     Michael Fanning, a spokesman for Michelin North America, the
number two U.S. tire maker that also manufactures the B.F.
Goodrich and Uniroyal brands, said any move by the U.S. to add
tariffs or restrict imports ``will hurt the downstream users.''

                      No Domestic Suppliers

     ``We import a lot of high-quality steel from outside the
United States from companies in Germany, France, Japan, simply
because we can't get it in this country,'' Fanning said. ``We find
it disheartening that we would be penalized simply because we
can't get any domestic supplier.''
     The American Institute for International Steel, an
association of U.S. and foreign companies that support free trade,
said American steel companies themselves would be damaged by
import restrictions because they are among the largest importers
of foreign products.
     Domestic steelmakers imported almost a third of the 37.8
million tons of foreign steel brought into the U.S. last year, the
institute said. Most was in the form of ``slab'' -- raw steel --
or semi-finished products that were finished by U.S. companies.
     Bill Jens, owner of Ataco Steel Products Corp. of Cedarburg,
Wisconsin, whose 100-employee company annually sells $13 million
in lawn and garden implements, among other products, said Bush's
move is aimed at ``protecting companies that are really something
of a dinosaur.''
     ``They haven't been keeping up technologically with what's
been going on in the world, and all of a sudden we're going to be
forced to buy their steel at a higher price because they can't
keep up?'' he said. ``I don't think that's right.''



Pacific Hydro Bends With the Wind, Flows With Water (Update5)

Pacific Hydro Bends With the Wind, Flows With Water (Update5)

     (Closes stock price.)

     Melbourne, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- Pacific Hydro Ltd., the best-
performing stock in Australia's key index in the year to date,
hopes the westerly gales that buffet the southern coast will lift
its shares even higher.
     The Melbourne-based company plans to turn squalls into
electricity by building 114 windmills on the Victoria coastline.
It says the nation's biggest wind farm would provide enough power
for 200,000 households.
     After tumbling this week, Pacific Hydro shares rose 8.8
percent today, its biggest daily gain in almost six months. That
brings its increase in the past six months to 96 percent,
outpacing rivals on the S&P ASX 200 Index, and some investors say
it could keep rising.
     ``In a climate of higher energy prices, we like renewable
energy and this company is doing it very well,'' said Ian Huntley,
who holds Pacific Hydro shares among the A$44 million ($23
million) he manages at Huntley Investment Co. ``Looking at its
growth in revenue and earnings, it does very well whatever
business it's in.''
     Granted, Pacific Hydro isn't cheap. Even after this week's 15
percent slump, it trades at 72 times earnings -- almost twice the
average ratio on an index of local utility stocks. Earnings from
power stations in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand may
not justify that high a valuation.
     ``They're probably the foremost experts in wind energy in
Australia -- management is very good,'' said Andrew King, whose
A$350 million of stocks at Investors Mutual Ltd. don't include
Pacific Hydro. Still, ``it's just a bit too high on valuation at
the moment,'' he said.

                         California

     Yet comparable companies elsewhere are even more expensive on
a price-earnings basis. Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S, for
example, trades at almost 80 times earnings. Its shares more than
tripled last year.
     Managing Director Jeff Harding's ambition could see his
company build as many as 1,000 windmills, rivaling the largest
windmill owners like U.S.-based FPL Group Inc., Enron Corp., and
Iberdrola SA, Spain's second-largest utility.
     Besides its expansion plans, the company can also take
advantage of a new Australian law that raises the amount of
electricity the nation gets from renewable resources to 12 percent
from 10 percent. A wind farm takes only nine months to build
compared with a hydroelectric power station, which can take as
long as seven years.
     Commodity prices have cooperated in pushing up prices of so-
called green stocks like Pacific Hydro. The price of natural gas
more than quadrupled in the past year. Oil doubled since 1999. The
price of coal, used to produce 80 percent of Australia's
electricity, rose more than 50 percent in 12 months.
     In California, meantime, power shortages have crippled the
wealthiest U.S. state, boosting demand for alternative energy
sources like wind and water.
     ``People have seen what's happened to the energy sector in
the States,'' said Stuart Smith, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.
``Even though (Pacific Hydro stock) has pulled back a lot, it's
still been a performer.''

                               Nepal

     Australians are hungry for energy. They are the fifth-biggest
consumers of electricity, lagging Norway and the U.S.
     Pacific Hydro's earnings may triple this year to A$18.5
million, helped by the start of its Bakun hydroelectric station on
the northwest Philippines island of Luzon, which almost doubled
the company's electricity generation.
     It plans to build another hydro station on the southern
Mindanao Island with joint venture partner Aboitiz Equity Ventures
Inc. Though a new Philippine law to allow more competition in the
electricity industry will drive down power prices, Pacific Hydro's
Harding said most of its output will be sold under long-term
contracts.
     Its next target country may offer even greater challenges. As
Nepal struggles to launch an inquiry into the massacre of its
royal family, Harding is awaiting the kingdom's decision on
whether to accept a bid to build two hydroelectric dams.
     ``Only one in 14 Nepalese has access to electricity, so there
is quite a demand for power within Nepal and northern India,''
Harding said. Because of rivers that run from the Himalayas, the
world's tallest mountain peaks, ``Nepal has the best hydro
resources in the world.''
     Pacific Hydro, which has risen 67 percent in the year to
date, rose 35 cents, or 8.8 percent, to A$4.32.

The Chicago City Council on Wednesday approved a blueprint for drawing new=20

In practical terms, passage of the measure means that growth in the number o=

Enron Plans to Challenge Power Regulator's Order, Paper Says
2001-06-06 23:24 (New York)


     Mumbai, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- The Indian unit of Enron Corp.
plans to challenge an order from the Maharashtra state power
regulator that prevents the company from seeking international
arbitration, the Business Standard said, without citing people.
     The regulator barred Dabhol Power Co., the Indian unit of
Enron, from seeking arbitration about its payment dispute with the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board until June 14, the paper said.
     Dabhol has decided to challenge the order in court on the
grounds that it is beyond the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory
Commission's rights to bar the company from resorting to
arbitration, the paper said.
     Dabhol and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, are in a dispute over power tariffs. The board stopped
buying power from Dabhol after the U.S. energy company took steps
to end a $3 billion power venture.

Since when does rape equal justice?

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

The attorney general of California is very unhappy about the state's energy=20
crisis, and he has come up with the perfect solution. It involves a creative=
=20
type of punishment for Kenneth Lay, chairman of the Houston-based energy=20
company Enron. Though Lay has not been convicted of any crime, Bill Lockyer=20
says, "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he coul=
d=20
share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "=20
Let the record show that the chief law enforcement officer for the nation's=20
biggest state regards prison rape as a valuable feature of his correctional=20
system. Soft-hearted souls may lament the sexual victimization of jail and=20
prison inmates by violent sociopaths, but Lockyer's chief concern is that=20
there are some people who have yet to experience this form of justice.
It used to be that prison was feared because it meant a prolonged loss of=20
freedom, hard labor, separation from family and, sometimes, violence by=20
guards. But somewhere along the line, Americans got used to the idea that it=
=20
also involves sadistic sexual abuse with no one doing anything to stop it.=20
Why are we so nonchalant? We might be outraged that anti-social thugs are=20
getting away with horrific new crimes every day, under the very noses of law=
=20
enforcement. Instead, many people--Lockyer among them--have embraced the=20
proposition that the victims are getting only what they deserve.=20
One of the reasons this phenomenon gets little attention is that it's largel=
y=20
invisible. Even critics can only make educated guesses about the scope of th=
e=20
problem. But it's clearly large. A survey of seven men's prisons in four=20
states, published last year in Prison Journal, found that 21 percent of=20
inmates had been coerced or forced into sexual contact, with 7 percent=20
reporting they had been raped.=20
When Human Rights Watch did a confidential poll of prison guards in an=20
unnamed southern state, they estimated that one in five inmates were victims=
=20
of such abuse. Inmates said it was more like one in three.=20
Suppose we take a conservative estimate and say that one of every 10 inmates=
=20
suffers this misfortune. With more than 1.8 million men behind bars at any=20
given time, that means at least 180,000 inmates are forcibly violated every=20
year. And that's not counting what goes on in juvenile facilities. For=20
comparison's sake, in the entire United States, there were 124,730 reported=20
rapes of females in 1999.=20
How can sexual abuse possibly be regarded as an appropriate part of serving=20
time? Some of the victims are vicious thugs themselves. But many people in=20
prisons and jails were arrested for nonviolent offenses.=20
Many of us, if a close relative were found guilty of one of these crimes,=20
would think he should pay for his offense by losing his freedom for a long=20
while. But few of us would agree he deserves to be beaten, stabbed, sodomize=
d=20
and infected with AIDS, which is what prison often means. If a judge were to=
=20
give a convict a sentence like that, it would be ruled cruel and unusual=20
punishment.=20
Lockyer might not have the stomach to actually watch one of the encounters=20
that he finds so amusing. One inmate interviewed by Human Rights Watch had=20
complained to guards after being raped. His assailant then beat him with a=20
combination lock--breaking his neck, jaw, collarbone and finger, dislocating=
=20
his shoulder, and giving him two serious concussions--before raping him=20
again. Afterward, the victim could read the word "Master," the brand of the=20
lock, on his forehead. Many inmates submit rather than risk being stomped to=
=20
a pulp.=20
Atrocities like this happen all the time, mainly because hardly anyone minds=
=2E=20
Authorities have no great incentive to take the problem seriously because=20
they generally can't be held liable for attacks. In overcrowded, understaffe=
d=20
facilities, prevention may be impossible. Prosecutors, meanwhile, see no nee=
d=20
to seek punishment.=20
Treating prison rape like the crime it is would deter some attacks. Prisons=20
could also act swiftly to segregate the perpetrators from the rest of the=20
inmate population. The surest remedy is also the most expensive: Put all=20
prisoners in one-man cells, so they don't have to sleep with one eye open.=20
Or maybe we should just require all government officials with responsibility=
=20
for prisons and jails to spend a couple of nights a year in one of their own=
=20
facilities. Since you're already acquainted, Mr. Lockyer, you'll be rooming=20
with Spike.=20

Calif Eyes Ending Access To Alternative Power Suppliers
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators appear ready to vote=
=20
next week on a proposal to suspend the ability of large electricity users to=
=20
sign contracts directly with energy suppliers.=20
The move is called for in the February bill that put the state in the power=20
business, but its approval by the California Public Utilities Commission=20
would damp plans in the Legislature to reduce the burden on Edison=20
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison by making large=20
industrial customers responsible for securing their own power.
"We're still trying to figure that out," said an aide to Assembly Speaker Pr=
o=20
Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. "We don't know how to get around that righ=
t=20
now."=20
Keeley is expected to introduce legislation to shift the burden of rescuing=20
Southern California Edison to large businesses. Under the proposal, which is=
=20
also supported by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, customers that use 500=20
kilowatt-hours of power a month or more would pay a surcharge on their bills=
=20
to help Southern California Edison recoup its losses on wholesale power.=20
The so-called direct-access component - under those large users would buy=20
their power from suppliers - is the cornerstone of the Keeley plan, for whic=
h=20
Enron has been lobbying hard in recent weeks, according to several aides to=20
key legislators.=20
The Keeley plan is an alternative to the memorandum of understanding Gov.=20
Gray Davis signed with Southern California Edison two months ago. Under that=
=20
proposal, the state would buy Southern California Edison's power lines for=20
$2.76 billion and allow the utility to issue $2 billion in bonds backed by=20
ratepayers to recover $3.5 billion in net uncollected power costs.=20
That plan has run into snags in the Legislature, which must enact it into=20
law, and the PUC, which has been slow to rule on enabling measures.=20
One key Democratic Senator said the PUC's move to quash direct access is an=20
attempt to ensure a deal to rescue Southern California Edison doesn't pass=20
through the Legislature.=20
"The PUC has demonstrated it does not want SoCal Ed to remain solvent," the=20
senator said. "They have dragged their feet on several key issues they need=20
to address in order to make sure legislation to save the utility is never=20
heard."=20
A PUC spokesman didn't return calls for comment.=20
Direct-access was the key part of the state's 1996 deregulation law, giving=20
retail customers the opportunity to choose from a variety of energy supplier=
s=20
in an effort to lower their electric rates.=20
Commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque said they support direct access=20
and would vote against any measure to reverse it.=20
"I would never vote against direct access," said Bilas, a Republican, who=20
authored the agenda item. Bilas said the item was amended by another=20
commissioner.=20
The measure could be held, because it might disrupt negotiations between the=
=20
Legislature and Southern California Edison, said PUC Commissioner Geoffrey=20
Brown, a Democrat.=20
The PUC may be looking to protect the state's interest as a power purchaser,=
=20
some legislative aides said.=20
The DWR's long-term power supply contracts cover the state's wholesale-marke=
t=20
power needs in 2002 and 2003. If large industrial customers were to sign=20
direct-access contracts, the DWR would lose them as customers and thus fail=20
to collect enough revenue to pay off the long-term contracts.=20
The agency could be stuck with a large surplus of electricity that it would=20
be forced to sell it on the open market at a loss. The market price of power=
=20
in the coming years is expected to be lower than what the state paid for=20
forward power in 2001.=20
Wholesale power prices plunged this week, and the DWR for the first time sol=
d=20
excess power on the open market, according to Oscar Hidalgo, DWR spokesman.=20
Arnold Rosenthal, of Newport Beach-based Utility Resource Management Group,=20
an organization that represents more than 700 large electricity users in the=

e=20
are held captive once again."=20
"The DWR is acting as this super utility," Rosenthal said. "What you're left=
=20
with is absolutely no choice. Instead, we'll be subjected to several large=20
rate increases."=20
Rosenthal said some of his San Diego clients have direct access deals. A=20

direct-access contracts to escape recent rate increases imposed by the PUC.=20
