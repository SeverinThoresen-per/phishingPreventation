Sorry I didn't reply to this by return.  So far we have had no feedback re=20
any of the newer schedules but these things take time in Japan from my=20
experience.  I guess we will just have to deal with that feedback when we ge=
t=20
it - I think though that after all the work you have done in getting the=20
forms into shape, it should be much easier for me to take the lead when=20
things move forward because we will be dealing with standalone issues.

I have not replied to IBJ and am hoping to get to this this week.  If I have=
=20
any questions, in the first case, if you didn't mind I guess it would be goo=
d=20
if I could try them on you.  If this didn't work for any reason, I would of=20
course be able to address them to your successor.

Re BTM - you may recall that they insisted that we work from their draft. I=20
need to try and finalize my response to them this week and if I have any=20
questions, would propose that I deal with them as above.=20

By the way has your successor been decided?

Finally, I have really appreciated the way you helped me out of the jam and=20
hope that I will be able to repay the favor one day.

Good luck with power trading - when our power trading business here finally=20
gets on its feet, who knows, we may work together again.
