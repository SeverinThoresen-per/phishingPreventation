FYI - I talked with David Johnson regarding that article from the New
England Power Plant Journal. He said he could not find it and he thinks he
already threw it away.  I will let you know if he locates any other
interesting articles and this time, I won't let him throw it away!

Also, I spoke with David Sweet, Independent Petroleum Association of
America.  He is interested in chairing that session, but is awaiting budget
concerns.  I'll forward the email to you that he sent me. =20

We are going to call him at 9:00 a.m tomorrow.  Do you want to be included
on the call?
