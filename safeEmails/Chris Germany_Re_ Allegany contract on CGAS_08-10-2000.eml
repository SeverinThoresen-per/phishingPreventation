I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we=20
don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify. =20

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of=20
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment=
=20
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verificatio=
n=20
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager,=20
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal=20
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the=20
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are=20
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for=20
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of=
=20
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of=20
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this=20
contract?=20

We are noming agent only on Contract 37982 but a Service Verification=20
