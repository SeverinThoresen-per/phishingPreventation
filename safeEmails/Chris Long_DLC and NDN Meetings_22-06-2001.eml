NDN

Senator Bingaman (D-NM) chaired the New Democratic Network (NDN) energy=20
breakfast this morning. He told me he was looking forward to meet with Ken=20
later in the day.   He talked about how his Committee plans to proceed,=20
beginning with the release today to Senators of a document that identifies=20
issues that were included in both the Murkowski and Bingaman drafts of energ=
y=20
legislation.  He hopes to make this the starting point for bipartisan=20
comprehensive legislation.
Bob Simon, Committee Staff Director, told me he was interested in working=20
with Enron.

After Sen. Bingaman departed, Reps. Cal Dooley (D-CA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Adam=
=20
Smith (D-WA), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) talked about the New Dems energy plan. =
=20
They restated their intent to focus on policy and not the rhetoric being=20
spread by the Democratic Leadership.  They also say they want a "goal" to=20
reach, for instance, energy independence by 2020.    I mentioned open access=
=20
on the electricity grid as a mid-term energy policy goal.

Follow up:  I spoke to Rep. John Larson's staff about our investment in  fue=
l=20
cell technology in Connecticut.  They called and want to meet with us next=20
Wednesday.

DLC=20

The DLC is currently considering energy policy and Peter Fox Penner is=20
leading the drafting.  They hope to have the plan developed and released in=20

The pre-California regulatory environment clearly did not work as it should.=
 =20
How can we improve FERC, state and local regulatory regimes to avoid another=
=20
California.

Mandate a "Clean Quarter":  Ensure that at least a quarter of all new energy=
=20
production come from "clean" energy  sources defined by low emissions=20
output.  The goal is to increase renewable energy, but it is unrealistic to=20
deny the need for fossil fuels.  So the DLC would look to mandate renewables=
=20
and cleaner burning fossil fuels.

Encourage deregulation and competition,  through support and transition=20
funds.  The goals is to ease the transition into deregulate markets and the=20
volatility that often accompany such a transition.  Create investment funds=20
(like a Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) to make a move to competitive markets=20
easier and less threatening.

Create a market to tradeable Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard=20
units.

 On transmission, the DLC would expand transmission by creating binding=20
Regional Electricity Siting Compacts that would ease eminent domain issues.

4P and 3P trading programs.  The DLC would support efforts  to expand=20
emissions trading beyond S02, to NO2 and Mercury (and possibly CO2).  I spok=
e=20
to Pat Shortridge and Lisa Jacobsen and will offer them up to the DLC as=20
experts on these programs.

Full-scale reexamination of Nuclear as a viable energy source.

Encourage real-time pricing to avoid reliance on spot markets.

Mandate new buildings be constructed "smart" and provide incentives to=20
encourages large industrials and buildings to outsource their energy needs. =
=20


Follow up:  The DLC is going to look to Enron for ideas on how to structure=20
these proposals over the coming weeks.  Perhaps Rick Shapiro could spend som=
e=20
time with Peter Fox Penner and Will Marshall when he is in town next week.
