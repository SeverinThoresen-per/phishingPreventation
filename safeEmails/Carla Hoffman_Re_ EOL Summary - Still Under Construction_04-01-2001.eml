Subject: EOL Summary - Still Under Construction

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL=20
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report=20
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the=20
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence th=
e=20
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate
