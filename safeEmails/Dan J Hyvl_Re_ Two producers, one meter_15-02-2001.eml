John,
 My first question is how does Cutter determine Harley's volume?  This=20
procedure should be added to the document providing for the fixed price.  Ha=
s=20
Harley set up Cutter as his Seller's Representative so that he can provide u=
s=20
notices, volumes, statements and receive Harley payments?  If not, we should=
=20
add that to the Harley agreement and have Cutter sign in the capacity of=20
Seller's Representative.  Call me at (713) 853-6895 to discuss in further=20
detail.

Dan,
Cutter Oil Company, one of my producers has a meter connected to a Columbia=20
Gas Transmission line.  Harley Drilling & Producing is currently putting a=20
small volume of gas through this meter.  I pay Cutter for all the flowing=20
gas, Cutter then pays Harley for his portion.  Harley is wanting to lock-in =
a=20
fixed price for a firm volume for part of his gas, about 40%-50%.  Cutter ha=
s=20
in the past locked-in fixed prices for firm volumes and most likey will do s=
o=20
in the future. =20

Two producers, Cutter Oil & Harley Drilling, wanting to lock-in fixed prices=
=20
for firm volumes for gas flowing through one meter owned by Cutter Oil:
Is there a method to lock-in a portion of Harley's production at a fixed=20
price which flows through Cutter's meter?
What contractual language needs be added to the ENFOLIO GAS PURCHASE=20
AGREEMENT?
Should an addendum be added to both contracts (Harley and Cutter)?

John=20
