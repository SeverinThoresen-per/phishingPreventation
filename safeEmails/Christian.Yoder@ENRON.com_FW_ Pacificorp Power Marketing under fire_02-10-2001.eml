Remember those  days, so long ago, it now seems, when we were considering on=
e of these deals?   Difficult as it is to predict things in California becau=
se of continual reversals,  it appears for now,  that history is continuing =
to  smile  on our decision not to take the "regulatory" risk by entering int=
o one of these infamous contracts. That very risk which we sought to imagine=
 and draft contractual language to deal with, now looms up before everybody'=
s incredulous eyes.   ----cgy

State PUC seeks to void Davis' power contracts=20
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators=20

In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power ma=
rket, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices=
 for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action=
 against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals go=
uge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the s=
tate's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it=
 wants some of those prices cut.=20
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts =
if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would supp=
ort anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down."=20
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was c=
hallenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us=
," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resourc=
es, which negotiated the contracts.=20
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than curren=
t market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round =
of spiraling spot market prices.=20
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "I=
f that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to cree=
p up."=20
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it=
 has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week w=
ere less than $30.=20
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to laws=
uits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to re=
pay the state general fund for the power purchases.=20
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on var=
ious grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals n=
egotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra =
Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher.=20
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that=
 the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, so=
me of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at l=
east $43 billion for electricity.=20
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack becau=
se while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' en=
ergy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company.=20
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other =
contracts.=20
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comm=
ent until it had studied the PUC submissions.=20
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- memb=
er commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though=
 it is controlled by the governor's three appointees.=20
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for uti=
lity customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay o=
ff the planned $12.5 billion bond issue.=20
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threa=
tened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budge=
t next year.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the co=
mmission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintai=
n a prolonged role as an energy buyer.=20
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy ch=
oices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as =
flexible as possible.=20
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the=
 contracts.=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings do=
n't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state defaul=
t on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the sta=
te improve the deals, he said.=20
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he =
said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the =
contract."=20
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Unde=
r power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its o=
wn finding that the contract prices were reasonable.=20
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp =
Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiati=
ons.=20
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviousl=
y disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts =
are honored."=20
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power =
when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. =
That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts,=
 the PUC says.=20
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over th=
e then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed =
through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said.=20
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he o=
wned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was bei=
ng worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he =
had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal.=20
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy=
 picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions =
to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from f=
ellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to s=
tabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utilit=
y bankruptcy filing.=20
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggres=
sively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.=20
PG&E'S PLANT PROPOSAL
PG&E Corp. has proposed to emerge from bankruptcy protection by transferring=
 all the power plants it still owns, as well as its natural gas and power tr=
ansmission lines, into subsidiaries free of state regulation.=20
PG&E says it will protect consumers from a replay of this year's price spike=
s by selling the power from its new free-market plants at a stable rate thro=
ugh contracts that phase out in nine to 12 years.=20
Consumer advocates and state regulators say that stable rate -- 5 cents a ki=
lowatt hour -- is more than 60 percent higher than PG&E now gets under state=
 regulation.=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County), warned that th=
e state could be heading into a second wave of the energy crisis.=20
"The problem with this new phase we're going into is that the concepts are m=
ore theoretical and the impacts are very much delayed," Keeley said. "There =
won't be the same urgency to wrestle this energy monster to the ground."=20
