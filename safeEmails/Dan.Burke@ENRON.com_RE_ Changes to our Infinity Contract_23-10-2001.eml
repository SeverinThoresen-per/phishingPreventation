Any update to this?

Is there a way for Enron to pay Infinity electronically?

Michelle,
What would you suggest?  To jog your memory, Infinity is the outsourcing gro=
up Freight Markets is using in Chicago?not for recruiting at all.  Should we=
 just add a PWD (or whatever they're called) reflecting the different rate f=
or the Director?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy,

Who do I need to talk to about changes to our Infinity Customer Solutions co=
ntract?

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the con=
tract should reflect that.

Thanks

Dan Burke
