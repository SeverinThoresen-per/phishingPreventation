Richard,

Marcus told me that wanted to refer to you and me the above-referenced new M=
G=20
Metals matter.  Briefly, ICTS of Athens, Alabama, one of MG Metals' shipping=
=20
agents, has reportedly gone into bankruptcy, without paying about $80,000=20
owed to various motor carriers (truckers) for transportation here in the U.S=
=20
of MG Metal's aluminum.  No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone=
=20
into bankruptcy. =20

MG Metals' offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers'=20
demand letters for these freight charges, some of which are from attorneys=20
threatening suit.  These letters state that as consignee of the various=20
cargoes, MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges.  =
I=20
think that this is generally correct as a matter of U.S. law, given the usua=
l=20
motor carrier bills of lading, although I am having this double-checked. =20

Since we have already paid most (but not all) of the money we owed to ICTS,=20
MG Metals is looking at a double-payment exposure.  Also, even to the extent=
=20
that ICTS has not been paid, it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended=20
itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough t=
o=20
cover both ICTS's commission and the trucker's freight charges; in other=20
words, a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than=
=20
MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS (which amount should have covered=20
both freight and commission). =20

I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is $15,000. =20
Bob Klide of MG's New York office and Nicole Dion of MG's Canada office (no=20
relationship to Celine--I asked) will be shortly sending me their files. =20

To complicate things a bit more, many of the letters Nicole has received dea=
l=20
with shipments made in March, at a time when Nicole and her office were=20
employees of a trading division of Barclay's.  Some time afterward, they wer=
e=20
acquired by MG Metals.  As a result of this, Barclay's may (depending on the=
=20
agreement between Barclay's and MG Metals) be on the hook for some of this=20
liability.  Nicole advises she has place a Barclay's representative on notic=
e.

I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like. =20
Obviously, it is a small dollar case and we don't want to pay any money to=20
anyone unless we absolutely have to.  Let me know.

Britt
