We will need to look at our vacation pay practice with Weil to determine whe=
ther we can pay out in the future for accrued, but unused vacation.
I think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confi=
rm with Weil.
Don't know about parking/bus.  I think it is regular course, but we may have=
 to change that regular course.

key questions that would be great to answer for current employees before Fri=
day:

-Vacation policy, we should be able to answer this one ourselves. do we real=
ly need Weil's input?
-Severance, obviously part of the retention request to the courts, but can w=
e say that they will get no less than $4500?
-Parking subsidy/bus subsidy-i'm tracking this with Steve Kean
-business expenses paid pre-petition, part of the clarification to courts. j=
ust so you know, George Wasaff is not processing any expenses pre-filing acr=
oss the board.



I would love to be able to answer vacation, i think we should draft the foll=
owing:

-Carry over is 1 week, with exceptions approved by manager (Michelle, David =
is concerned to put out a blanket 2 week carry over as there are only pocket=
s of people working all hours to year end)
-We will pro-rate starting Jan 1 2002.  So when people are termed, they will=
 receive prorated vacation, not full as in past, plus any carry over.

Why can't we get this one out?
