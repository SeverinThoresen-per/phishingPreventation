Matt:

Here is where we stand with the Centrans arrangement.

1.  I have spoken to Daniel R. Castagnola, a VP in Finance who has worked wi=
th the Centrans and speaks highly of their business acumen in Central Americ=
a.  The transactions Enron has done with Centrans to date involve equity tra=
nsactions whereby any Enron credit exposure was hedged by assets.  So, the f=
inancial strength of Centrans was not directly in question.  Daniel indicate=
d that we should look at Centrans independently to establish a transaction i=
n Baja.  To this end, we need financial statements from Centrans to establis=
h credit parameters and prepare a Master Power purchase Agreement. =20

2.  Stewart Rosman has made a few calls to CFE re: transmission access in Me=
xico.  CFE has indicated that transmission is available.  We have never purc=
hased transmission in Mexico and although it might be possible to do so, we =
would prefer if Centrans did it themselves and get the power into the ISO at=
 Tijuana, which is an ISO tie-point.  I would expect transmission on this ar=
rangement is probably worth $5 or so.  =20

3.  Forward Prices - As you know, the longer term price at SP-15 for Peak is=
 about $36 - $37.  Off peak is about $10 lower.  This nets about $30 to the =
project in Baja.  I am not sure what fuel price to use, but it seems unlikel=
y that project economics would be supported by such a price.
My recommendation would be to proceed with the credit review and set up cont=
racts with Centrans.  This would require obtaining financial statements from=
 them.=20
Let me know if you want me to speak with them or if you are going to handle =
it.
Thanks
