Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the b=
asic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest i=
n that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual =
rampup to 3 bcf=20
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from K=
inder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps w=
hich you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with t=
he developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest s=
ooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but=
 we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest. =20

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would yo=
ur timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would i=
ncrease interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any ques=
tions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  T=
hanks!
