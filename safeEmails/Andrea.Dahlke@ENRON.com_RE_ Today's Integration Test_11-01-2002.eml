I have a small revision to make to our Power testing.  We will actually be t=
esting the DPR macros for power because they will be using the application i=
n the Estate world.  Has the specific database been determined that we will =
need to point the macros to for Estate?  I can have our IT support (Min Zhen=
g) work on it today for me if we have all the information determined.

Thanks!
