Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun a=
t=20
Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't buy a=
n=20
airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.  See wha=
t=20
you can find me.

I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the=20
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New=20
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.
