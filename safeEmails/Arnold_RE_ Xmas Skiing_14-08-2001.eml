Think we're settled on Xmas week to go skiing. If this not good, reply via e=
mail (Dad, you can phone).

Therefore we're looking at 22nd to 29th (possibly 30th??) Dec.=20

Location; Mart and I not got strong view other than not daft money, and woul=
d like nice scenery and maybe a few shops for Mart. i don't know enough abou=
t where we are likely to get good snow or not, Jim/Jenny might better advise=
=2E

In view of our restriction re. dates we might have limited choice anyway. I =
will have a look on internet, Jim/Jenny would you do same. Mum and Dad, migh=
t be better if you go to travel agents.

Suggest we touch base over weekend to review options.

Nick
