Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in=20
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we=20
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)=20
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer th=
e=20
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at=20
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose=
=20
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals =20
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking th=
e=20
Sunday's gain away from your book. =20

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This=20
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued=
=20
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.
