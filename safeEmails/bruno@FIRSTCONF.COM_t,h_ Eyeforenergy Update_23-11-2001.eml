Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really

international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting nwe market opportunity.  As ever, the
conference will be driven by the industry leaders in this arena, backed up
by expert advice from those helping the indsutry make the right moves in

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.
