Tim/Chris:

I spoke to Geoff to try to clarify what needs to be "moved or copied" to NET=
CO.  Bottom line, my view of it is that the key items that need to be identi=
fied today are models and systems such as EnPower, CAPS, the structuring mod=
els, etc.  Tim has already identified these things to Geoff in a separate e-=
mail.  There are thousands of other items such as contracts, customer excel =
and word files, address lists, etc. that we might ultimately want to utilize=
 at NETCO, but I do not think that these need to be identified at this time.=
  Although Geoff has indicated that we need to identify all items that we wo=
uld need at NETCO, my view is that we should not attempt to identify all of =
these files at this time because:

	-  	we likely could reproduce most of these files or obtain them from custo=
mers if we had to
	-  	transfer of such items might ultimately be permitted
	-  	identification of such items by close of business cannot be done in an =
organized fashion and throwing thousands of such files into the mix would 		=
	undoubtedly overwhelm the legal folks who are trying to identify the key it=
ems that need to be transferred.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Chris

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all =
systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identifie=
d the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to id=
entify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would =
include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close =
of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some d=
ata however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific=
 or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise
