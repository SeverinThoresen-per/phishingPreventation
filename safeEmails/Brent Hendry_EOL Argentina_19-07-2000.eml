This is a fairly aggressive schedule for meetings.  I am not sure that we=20
will have any updates of worth every three days.  I think Andrea should be=20
taken off of all work other than EOL and gas and electricity sales until EOL=
=20
is online if this is the kind of pressure Mike wants to put on this issue. =20
As it is Andrea does not have a lot of time to devote to this issue.  What i=
s=20
your suggestion?
