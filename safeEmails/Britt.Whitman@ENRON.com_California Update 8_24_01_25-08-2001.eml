EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=B7	A New MOU Takes Shape in the Assembly
=B7    The Fate of Direct Access
=B7    DWR Rate Agreement


California's Assembly Rallies 'Round a New MOU
The lights were burning late in the California Capitol last night as lawmake=
rs in the Democratic caucus volleyed final versions of the newly consolidate=
d Edison MOU bill, AB82.  Details leaked to the public concentrate on disput=
es over the valuation of SoCal's transmission line assets, however, sources =
report this matter is only a prelude to even greater contentious language bu=
ried in the bill's various sub clauses.  Earlier media reports noting that t=
he bill would be based on Senator Burton's preferred legislation are also fa=
r off the mark.  The draft bill tries to get the State out of the power busi=
ness as fast as possible and binds power users to decades of high prices.  T=
he proposed language also significantly reduces the chance of a SoCal Ed ban=
kruptcy and provides the company with lavish concessions.  SoCal Ed is compl=
aining about some technical details in public, but the draft bill offers pro=
bably the most generous deal any electricity utility has seen from regulator=
s.  Sacramento insiders tell us the bill has "a pretty good chance" of passi=
ng in the next 3-4 days, but could touch off a political and legal storm bec=
ause of its draconian impact on Californian power users.=20

The Assembly's AB 82 contains three primary additions that distinguish it fr=
om thee Senate's SB 78XX bill and:=20

1)	The Governor and Assembly Democrats propose to charge a massive 'exit fee=
' to any end user wanting to switch a future alternative power providers.  A=
ll California electricity users will be liable for the cost of Governor Davi=
s' expensive long-term power contracts for their whole term (save municipali=
ties like SMUD and LADWP).  This is apparently the only acceptable compromis=
e for legislators that would both secure revenue to cover the State's long-t=
erm power costs and maintain the promise of direct access established at the=
 onset of California's deregulation.  The clause sidesteps some of the obsta=
cles the California State Constitution places in the way of stopping direct =
access, particularly for municipalities.  But it could still be open to lega=
l challenge.  California officials hope that it will be enough to quiet the =
issue until the October power bond sale is finalized.

2)	The Assembly expanded the rate base of "commercial class" users to pay ba=
ck SoCal's bailout bonds by incorporating small businesses that use 20 kW.  =
It appears likely that this change was made because S&P told the state that =
a larger rate base would be needed to support the bailout bonds.  S&P wants =
all ratepayers to help repay and secure the bailout bonds; including small b=
usinesses.  This change is likely to draw heavy fire from the powerful Calif=
ornia Technology and Manufacturers' Alliance (CTMA).

3)	The PUC will be mandated to set rates at any level necessary to preserve =
SoCal Edison's solvency and borrowing ability.  This regulation essentially =
links consumer electricity rates with maintaining SoCal's investment grade c=
redit rating.  Arguably, SoCal would need to do little more than make a case=
 that that S&P might downgrade them and the CPUC would necessarily respond w=
ith a rate increase. If SoCal can get this concession, the nickel and dimes =
issue of transmission line valuation will be muted, a promising sign to thos=
e fearing bankruptcy.

Sources within the Sacramento Capitol inform us that the Governor and Hertzb=
erg are likely to get their way for now. The precise wording of the clauses =
may be toyed with in the final markup session, but we understand there is co=
nsiderable momentum behind the substance.  There are some indications that t=
he Governor may have overestimated the amount of support AB82 has in the Ass=
embly.  Republicans are not on board, so if the bill passes it will be subje=
ct to 90 days delay before taking effect.  It remains unclear whether the pl=
an will come to a vote next week.  When/if the plan does pass, it will likel=
y have no more than a 50% chance of escaping the Senate.  Senator Burton, th=
e consumer advocates, and the CTMA are staunchly against any plan that would=
 include small businesses in paying off SoCal's bailout bonds.  Sen. Minorit=
y leader Burlte told several lobbyists yesterday that the Republicans would =
walk away from any amended SB 78XX that emerged in the House, having already=
 agreed to the Sher bill (SB 78XX) before the recess. This is reportedly the=
 same attitude Brulte's counterpart in the Senate, John Burton, has articula=
ted -- and not a good sign for Edison.

Direct Access=20
Contrary to the CPUC's press release explaining their decision to delay the =
direct access ruling to allow more time to review the case, sources report t=
he reason for the delay is that the Commission prefers to wait for the Legis=
lature to act on SB 18XX (bond repayment) before ruling.  Key business commu=
nity leaders expect the PUC to formally end direct access on Sept. 6. Howeve=
r, the Legislature has the authority to reinstate direct access in whatever =
form it may choose.=20
Presuming the PUC carries out the expected action and permanently suspends d=
irect access; the following are some possible outcomes:=20

=B7	The Legislature, under pressure from a unified business community, could=
 restore direct access before the end of the session allowing moderate Democ=
rats in swing districts to say they protected the economic climate, but only=
 with exit fees and time commitment restrictions that are unpalatable to bus=
inesses. Many in the business community are willing to accept having to "eat=
" a DWR surcharge for long-term power contract commitments and a surcharge t=
o pay for a substantial portion of Edison's accumulated debt. But according =
to our sources, Legislative Democrats are insisting on exit fees substantial=
ly beyond these surcharges to head off the need for additional residential r=
ate increases that might be needed to satisfy DWR commitments.

=B7	If this occurs, or if the Legislature simply stands idle and declines to=
 restore direct access, business leaders may likely give up on direct access=
 and shift their efforts to restructuring the rate allocation to shift a gre=
ater portion of the burden to the residential ratepayer classes. (The March =
rate increase by the PUC placed a disproportionate share of the revenue requ=
irement burden on the industrial ratepayer classes.) This would present a hu=
ge political challenge. But because the amount of net short power expected t=
o be available for direct access agreements is so small -- one estimate plac=
es it at no more than 5000 MW (or about 10% of demand) through 2007 -- there=
 is growing sentiment in the business community that it is no longer really =
worth fighting for direct access given the political obstacles.

=B7	Additionally, there is the interesting prospect that DWR itself might ex=
pand and dominate the market for net short power sales, given the agency's e=
xpected surplus supply via the forward contracts. There is nothing in law or=
 regulation currently that would prevent DWR from acting as a market partici=
pant and selling excess power; indeed, DWR already sells excess power to mun=
icipal utilities, private utilities and power managers outside California.=20

DWR Rate Agreement and Edison Rescue=20
In the Senate informational hearing today on the DWR rate agreement, DWR rep=
resentatives acknowledged that the agency is still negotiating contracts for=
 additional forward power.  This prompted concern by some legislators and co=
nsumer activists who believe DWR has already over-purchased long term power,=
 causing sales by DWR of excess power for as little as $1 per MW at times th=
is summer.
