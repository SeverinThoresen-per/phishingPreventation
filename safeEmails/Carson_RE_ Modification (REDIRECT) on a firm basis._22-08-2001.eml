It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redire=
ct must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmissio=
n available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at least, =
there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TVA.  =
Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...
If you guys read this notice any different, please let me know.

Does this mean Ent is wavering on the firm point-to-point argument?  maybe p=
ressure being felt through the RTO process?

To:	Entergy Transmission Customers

Subject: 	Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.


Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting =
partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines lis=
ted below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and success=
fully allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become avail=
able for other customers to purchase. If you have any questions, please call=
 David McNeill at 870-541-3931 or Cameron Warren at 870-543-5497.



Section 22.2 - Modification on a Firm Basis

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the source/sink=
 or POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no a=
dditional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for f=
irm service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via OASIS=
 using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to the =
start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm basi=
s (twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current busin=
ess practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original r=
equest in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity a=
s the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the ori=
ginal reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly, mon=
thly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of or=
iginal reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start date=
 or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights to=
 the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release th=
e original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes to r=
evert back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subject to=
 the same guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original reservatio=
n only.
