On Saturday 5-05-01, Dean, Dustin & myself were attempting to schedule a 100=
=20
mws from NSP to AMRN for HE 16, and we received very little help or courtesy=
=20
from the MAPP security center.  This deal cost us $1200 profit (bought $40=20
from NSP and sold $52 to AMRN). Three MAPP Fs were submitted showing as the=20
POD:  (NSP.AMRN, ALTW.AMRN, MEC.AMRN).    All the requests were returned as=20
"refused."  Ample ATCs were showing on the MAPP web page from NSP to AMRN,=20
ALTW to AMRN, MEC to AMRN.  Pat, the file with these ATC printouts are on=20
your desk.  No explanation was given as to the reason for the refusal on the=
=20
oasis.  Furthermore, no explanation was given upon calling the MAPP Security=
=20
Center.  In fact, the gentleman at MAPP hung up on us when we called. =20

This was not an example of MAPP's finest in customer service.  Dustin=20
suggested adding this situation to your complaint file.  We wanted to make=20
you aware of the situation.
