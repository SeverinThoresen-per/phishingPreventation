The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will inc=
rease the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between=
 our two systems. =20
=20
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points a=
fter the 1st.  And our response has been that we would expect the restrictin=
g party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations. =20
=20
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.   Mirant =
should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two poin=
ts on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of n=
ot being scheduled.  They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that =
have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.  And as you know, t=
hey supplied the reverse auction point.   But from what we have heard on the=
 street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets w=
ho were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.  That is why I fe=
el the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
=20
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; =
they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, s=
uch as Marshall.  But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberde=
en or Warner on our system.  And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen o=
n the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call. =20
=20
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have =
the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.  If we=
 do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of =
this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our =
side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta ye=
ars ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.  But that is as far as we a=
re planning to go.   We view the flow restriction to be on your side.  And w=
e are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1s=
t.=20
=20
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, w=
e would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled=
 at the point.  Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such =
an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the poi=
nt.  But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both=
 sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end. =20
=20
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a=
 long term solution to deal with that situation.  Any ideas as to how we can=
 effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especiall=
y given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibilit=
y we may have today could be restricted in the future.
