Mesquite has an internal approval process which cannot be completed until=20
late this week or early next.  We have slowed our approval process to=20
parallel theirs.  We will sign doc's when we have both received all necessar=
y=20
internal approvals.  Signing is now expected to be early next week.

In addition we have resolved the two minor commercial issues mentioned in=20
last update.  The final price has been adjusted slightly - impact on=20
transaction value is minimal.   See the attached excel spreadsheet for the=20
new Annex 1.02 numbers for the Mesquite swaps (also the assumed closing date=
=20
has been moved to 27-Dec).  The Merlin issue has been resolved with an=20
indemnity from ENA in the unlikely event El Paso must pay a make whole=20
premium on the refinancing of Merlin's $30mm participation (maximum exposure=
=20
approx. $675k).

One additional issue has arisen concerning a consent right by the Bayonne=20
minority partners in the event the Managing Venturer is no longer an Enron=20
affiliate.  This consent right was granted at the time of the McNair=20
acquisition and was not part of the primary project documents.  This right=20
was not recognized in V&E's initial review of consent requirements for this=20
transaction.  Of the three minority partners, Mission will be acquired in th=
e=20
next few days by ECP and ECP is in final negotiations to acquire Calpine's=20
interest by year end.  Consent from the remaining partner, ANP, is not=20
expected to be a problem.  This or some other work around will be added as a=
=20
condition precedent to closing.  While we still expect to close by year end=20
this new development adds an unwelcome uncertainty to our process.

We will recirculate the DASH, adjusted as necessary for these changes, as=20
soon as practical.
