Hi Vince,  I already spoke with Maureen and we discussed timing.  Yana will=20
stay until a replacement is found and trained.   As for the permanent=20
transfer, that is not a problem.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Andrea,

It's fine with me. Few points:

1. As a courtesy to Maureen Raymond, please, discuss the timing with her.

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATIO=
N.
     She was hired directly and   this means that we transfer her
     permanently to your unit.


Vince

I spoke to Yana today and understand that you are supportive of Yana rotatin=
g=20
through our group, EIM Fundamental Analysis.  We are very pleased that Yana=20
will be joining us.  Her skill set will be particularly helpful as we build=20
the steel business.

I was hoping that Yana could begin working with us mid December.   Does a=20
start date in EIM of Dec. 18 work for you?  Please let me know.

Once again, thank you for your support.

Andrea
