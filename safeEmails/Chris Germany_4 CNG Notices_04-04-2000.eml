Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG=20
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission=
=20
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission line=
s=20
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to=20
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.  =
=20
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting=20
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines. =20
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943,=20
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000,=20
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective=20
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff=
=20
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff=20
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel=20
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have=
=20
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at=20
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings=20
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance=20
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires=20
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in. =20
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no=20
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations=20
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions=20
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed=20
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets=20
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m.=20
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations=20
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight=20
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per=20
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT=20
considering=20
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your=
=20
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult=20
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your=20
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's=20
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators=20
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify=20
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted=20
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us=20
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled=20
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to=20
contact me at (304) 623-8698.=20

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements
