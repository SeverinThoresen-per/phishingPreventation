I may have zapped some of these updates from John since he has started this.=
  May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with Louise to have all=
 of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept=
 on performance issues prior to John starting this update process - as back =
up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to impro=
ve performance and reliability.  Can one of you get all of these updates?  T=
hanks. --Sally=20

Subject: Unify Operational Status


Summary of 9/25:
No major issues were encountered with Unify gas, other than periods of poor =
performance in the afternoon.=20
On Unify power, we are experiencing performance degradation with our deal lo=
ad process.   The process is now taking 6 hours, whereas in the past it woul=
d complete in 2 hours.  We restarted SQL Server on the evening of the 24th, =
but deal load performance did not improve on the 25th.=20
We experienced a major issue with Unify power whereby our replication from E=
npower was down for nearly an entire day.  We were made aware of the problem=
 at roughly 5:00 p.m.  We notified all users to exit the system, restarted S=
QL Server and our database server (as previously planned), and were caught u=
p at 10:00 pm.  We then started our planned nightly processing, but deal loa=
d performance did not improve.  We are working with the DBA team to improve =
notification in the event our replication processes are down.=20
=20
Summary of 9/26:
Unify gas performance was spotty during the morning under heavy usage.  We d=
iscovered a report being run in our production environment was contributing =
to our performance problems.  We will (again) reinforce the need to use the =
reporting database for such reporting in the future. =20
Our Sitara bridge experienced significant backlogs at roughly 2:00 pm.  Upon=
 investigation, we were receiving another SQL Server error (not the buffer l=
atch error) which seems to indicate that processes were "sleeping" while wai=
ting for system resources to free.  At that time, the Sitara bridge process =
was consuming a tremendous amount of system processes so we stopped that pro=
cess (after consulting with Bob Superty).  Other processes in waiting immedi=
ately began executing normally, and we started the bridge roughly 30 minutes=
 later.=20

Summary of Critical Unify Operational Issues:
Issue
Status
Next Steps
Buffer latch errors with SQL Server have caused us to bring down Unify durin=
g business hours.
Open
Microsoft will not deliver a fix to us by October as planned.  They have dis=
covered that the problem is an architectural issue with SQL Server, and will=
 require additional time to fix.  In the interim, they will provide us with =
diagnostic tools which may help us predict when the buffer latch error will =
surface.
Database locks are causing performance problems.
Open
As previously stated, we have changed our pre-emptive maintenance thresholds=
, and are working on other refinements of our ongoing maintenance efforts.  =
We are also closely monitoring database activity to locate programs which ar=
e contributing to this problem.
Power Deal Load processing is degrading each month.  As a result, our end of=
 month processes are bleeding over into normal business hours and causing ad=
ditional performance problems.
Open
We have analyzed our deal load process in detail, and are performing a signi=
ficant re-work.  Our plan is to have the process streamlined by October's en=
d of month processing.
