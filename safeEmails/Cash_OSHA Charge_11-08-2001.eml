Frank,

I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week. =20

During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draf=
t of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday.  I =
haven't seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today. =
 Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn't heard of that if=
 you were.

Would you please let me know the status?

Thanks a lot!

Michelle
