Micelle,
Can you please let me know what the status of the contract template for Japa=
n is?  I understand you are working on this with Baker & McKenzie for Jane M=
cBride.  I would be intersted in seeing the advice from B&M on this matter, =
because it would be helpful for me as the HR person in Tokyo.   As well, onc=
e the contract template is complete, if you could send it to me and Melissa =
Laing for our reference, that would be great.
Thank you for your help.
Caroline
