Andrew,

This will confirm our telephone conference of yesterday.  Again, I will be=20
your new contact at Enron in the above-referenced case.  You advised that=20
Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage clai=
m=20
against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of  approximately $165,000,=20
arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of=20
1991.  You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of=20
deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000.  This matter has=20
reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claim=
s=20
were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date.

You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion=
=20
that the parties just drop their respective claims.  I understand that you=20
feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client.  You=20
further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the=
=20
recent past entered into charters with Exmar.

It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given=20
what you have told me.  My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a=20
business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a=20
"drop hands" settlement.  If you retained the publication in which you read=20
about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately. =20
Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the=20
correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience.

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they=
=20
know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under=20
charter to Exmar.  If one of you can suggest other names I might check,=20
please let me know.  I would like to put this old dog out of its misery=20
before year end if it is humanly possible to do so.

Britt
