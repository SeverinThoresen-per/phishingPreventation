Subject: OASIS Version 1.4 Cutover

Just to make sure you are all aware, there is going to be an OASIS outage=20
coming up at the end of the month.  As I understand it, all S&CP compliant=20
OASIS nodes will be offline from 12 noon Wednesday, Feb 28th, to midnight of=
=20
Feb 28/March 1 (12 hours).  All the above will be local time, so expect=20
Eastern Time nodes to be out one hour earlier, Mountain Time nodes to be out=
=20
one hour later, and Pacific Time nodes to be out 2 hours later.

The outage is to upgrade OASIS from version 1.3 to 1.4.  This will mostly be=
=20
affecting the computer-to-computer template methods used by programs that=20
interact with OASIS.  Standard web interfaces should only be effected in=20
minor ways, if at all.

The plan is that all transactions will be taken by phone or fax during this=20
time, and posted on the OASIS as soon as they are back up and time permits. =
=20
I would suggest that the following actions be taken:

1.) Forward this message to Enron employee that buys or sells transmission o=
r=20
ancillary services on the OASIS.

2.) Forward this message to any developers that have written custom tools to=
=20
interact with OASIS nodes.  Remember, developers don't always know what is=20
going on in the industry.

3.) Begin mentioning this to Transmission Providers NOW to make sure they ar=
e=20
aware of this change and understand that they WILL have to work with fax and=
=20
verbal reservations.  Try to contact everyone you do business with and get=20
their commitments to address this before it develops into something nasty.

4.) Be prepared to deal with this on February 28th.  If you have time, see i=
f=20
you can do some test scenarios with our more important TPs, to make sure we=20
understand what information they are going to want for their processes.  Wil=
l=20
they have a special fax form to fill out?  Will they accept only verbal=20
requests? =20

Hopefully, this will be a smooth transition.  However, we need to be prepare=
d=20
in case it is not.

This will impact all 1.3 S&CP Compliant OASIS nodes.  I'm not sure who those=
=20
are, but I believe it will impact the following nodes:

MAPP OASIS
SPP OASIS (Holding a Workshop for 1.4 on February 16th)
NEPOOL OASIS (test node: http://nepooldev.jtsin.com/OASIS)
AEP OASIS
ECAR OASIS
MAIN OASIS
VACAR OASIS
Southern OASIS (test site: http://test.weboasis.com/)
Florida OASIS (FLOASIS) (test site: http://oasis.siemens-psc.com/)
Idaho Power OASIS
Northwest OASIS
Pacificorp OASIS
Rocky Mountain Area OASIS (RMAO)
Southwest OASIS (test site: http://www3.swoasis.com/OASIS/SRP/data2 login =3D=
=20
studentx Password =3D tx)
Western OASIS
PJM OASIS (test site: http://oasisstaging.pjm.com )

It may also impact other nodes I am not aware of.  Many of these will have=20
test sites up soon, so watch the OASIS for notices regarding them.
