Enron CFO's Partnership Had Millions in Profit

A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, An=
drew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it d=
id with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.=20
The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms o=
f existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the p=
artnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more =
than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital=
 increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which w=
as set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.=20
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors=
 in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as=
 the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates t=
he partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction earl=
y.=20
The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and=
 analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting=
 the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron sh=
areholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2=
 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia =
Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suis=
se Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.=20
Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous=
 time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the =
nation's biggest energy-trading company.=20
This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured busi=
ness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618=
 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investm=
ents in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp=
=2E, a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, wa=
s attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That termination a=
lso produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as the com=
pany decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM2 deal=
s.=20
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%,=
 or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 a =
share.=20
Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document.=
 Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They s=
aid the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at helping=
 hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding sources of=
 capital.=20
Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In lat=
e July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron of=
ficials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareholde=
rs. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with =
the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing com=
pany investments.=20
Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now =
helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe his =
relation to LJM2.=20
In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 m=
illion, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants a=
nd other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29=
% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of return =
at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a decline in =
the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related energy ret=
ailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target, thoug=
h this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.=20
In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in "Raptor III," whi=
ch involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a set =
price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron to s=
ettle the investment early, "causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million capital=
 invested plus $10.5 million in profit," the report said. The renegotiation =
was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced LJM2 to=
 buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indicated.

Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports
2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited
partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an internal partnership document.

     LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,
made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper
said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made
$7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in
capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the
partnership, the paper said.

     Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,
alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million
by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron
assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from
failed investments.

1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?
One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - n=
ews - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share pric=
e gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the stock=
 might be getting ahead of themselves.=20
Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for=
 Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the company'=
s overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, accordin=
g to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition of =
Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the d=
emand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug to be=
 approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.=20
Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's ov=
erall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics to =
combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increased,=
 not all the money would be spent on Cipro.=20
Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Cip=
ro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressure =
in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other manu=
facturers.=20
On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit related=
 to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forced=
 to withdraw the drug from the market.=20
Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a ref=
uge for investors.=20
2. Losses at Twice the Price
You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double t=
he price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO=
:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After market=
 close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted accoun=
ting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for the =
latest quarter, including all charges.=20
In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share pric=
e, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.=20
Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of =
Aspect Development in March 2000.=20
To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 t=
ypically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordinar=
y items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The company =
met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13 cen=
ts per share.=20
Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock down=
 25% the day after they were reported.=20
3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks
In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual at=
 many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - news =
- commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competi=
tor.=20
It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wor=
ds "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software maker Nov=
ell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false and mislea=
ding statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.=20
Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food. =
For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line on=
 the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare platf=
orm?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engineer=
s.)=20
The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consulting=
 services, which Novell says isn't true.=20
Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intended=
 to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was all in the t=
heme of a mock cereal box," he said. "It was a modest campaign."=20
In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in S=
eptember to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and i=
t's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the recor=
d, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money damage=
s.=20
4. AMD's Feisty Pledge
CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too mu=
ch to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical rou=
gh edges cross the line into embarrassing.=20
Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Device=
s (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss f=
or the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricing c=
ompetition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its revenue w=
as down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the f=
ourth quarter.=20
Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be e=
xtended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, he =
indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called "Hamm=
er" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel that when the up=
turn comes, we're going to kick ---."=20
Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, meet=
 Mr. Reeves.=20
OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his =
comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look bet=
ter when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, wha=
t matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwithstan=
ding.=20
5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style
Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - comm=
entary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produced =
results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they came f=
rom. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gotten e=
ven more unsettling.=20
To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a st=
eep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that it=
s shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.=20
In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to =
the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares." According to a r=
eport in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares issued=
 through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership that =
until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.=20
TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy En=
ron stock.=20
Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it ha=
d expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its accou=
nting critics.=20
Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify ex=
actly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say t=
he least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose CE=
O resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the year =
leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped another =
12.6%=20


The New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides For=
 Receivables and Inventory Financing

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company ("NewP=
ower"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) tod=
ay filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting th=
at it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp=
=2E, Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (together,=
 the "Enron Subsidiaries").=20
The amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Security=
 Agreement (the "Master Netting Agreement") among NewPower and the Enron Sub=
sidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral that=
 NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.
The effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amoun=
t of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsidia=
ries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million of p=
osted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70=
 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables an=
d inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and=
 subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivables and i=
nventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intention to sec=
ure asset-backed financing.=20
With the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a simil=
ar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPower=
 believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its business=
 until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessary up=
on the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively seekin=
g to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to date no =
such arrangements have been secured.=20
The Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per b=
asic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. Howev=
er, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than previ=
ously forecast.=20

LOBBYING
K Street's Top 10: The Shifting Lineup
Shawn Zeller

10/20/2001
National Journal
Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselve=
s in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates Inc.=
 does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to retai=
n them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, but it=
 is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenberg Tra=
urig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucrative b=
ook of clients.=20
These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal'=
s survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income fro=
m January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same ones=
 as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Patton =
Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, Mc=
Pherson and Hand.
But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping a=
t the heels of these top dogs.=20
Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 2001=
 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying firm=
s. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual li=
st of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income duri=
ng the first six months of last year.=20
And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-tim=
e member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinton =
White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to House =
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocket up=
ward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000.=20
In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. Th=
ere has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income at=
 the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act first t=
ook effect.=20
Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Was=
hington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers.=20
National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyin=
g the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the 1=
995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 top f=
irms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey.=20
With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassid=
y & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any fir=
m reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first half=
 of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months of =
this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million from th=
e Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwanese go=
vernment; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany & Co. p=
aid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mined in con=
flict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market.=20
Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, co=
mpany Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. "During difficult times, people com=
e to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come see=
king opportunities."=20
But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The firm=
, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half of =
2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this year. =
Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street mover an=
d shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last year=
, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, and brou=
ght $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gates, whi=
ch was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out of Natio=
nal Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by nearly 50=
 percent.=20
Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to th=
e Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the N=
orthern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that operate =
in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: the Co=
ushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, a hom=
ebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American Internat=
ional Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenberg Traur=
ig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists that his t=
eam of lobbyists has been "totally integrated" into the firm.=20
But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher =
earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded Co=
ngress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Section=
 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. This s=
ection of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban government fun=
ds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three men who=
 had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amendment t=
o the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victims of te=
rrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list of state s=
ponsors of terrorism.=20
Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Albe=
rto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue, =
a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The th=
ree men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on Feb=
ruary 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million in dam=
ages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department opposed pa=
yment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg Traurig =
reported a fee of $4 million.=20
Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice grou=
p, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case "establish=
ed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time effort=
s in the future," and noted, "We have a few coming down the pipeline."=20
Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem by=
 the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields i=
n Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and al=
l were eventually released.=20
Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, whi=
ch reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continued=
 its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc, w=
as the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clients =
between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients terminated=
 contracts during the period.=20
"We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a co=
ntract," said Van Scoyoc. "We make sure we're clear on the goals and objecti=
ves, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do everyt=
hing." The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 perc=
ent higher than its fees for the same period last year.=20
Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenbe=
rg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midyea=
r 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has only =
34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highest am=
ong the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trade Cou=
ncil paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid $525,=
000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win greater a=
ccess for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs were reinst=
ated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregulation, p=
articularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern California =
Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shortages in Cali=
fornia last summer.=20
Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to n=
early 30 today. "We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be R=
epublicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit the =
client," Quinn said.=20
Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, but=

The Texas Business Hall of Fame's annual awards ceremony Thursday night hono=
red four Houston business leaders.=20
The event at the George R. Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Wein=
garten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer founder=
 and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Chair=
man and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson.=20
This is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation h=
as honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event.=20
As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the com=
pany into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companies.=
=20
After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Houst=
on-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weingar=
ten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed free-s=
tanding supermarket stores.=20
The firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based comp=
any is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Weingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 states=
 from coast to coast.=20
Weingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Arc=
ade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galleri=
a.=20
Rod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a loc=
al ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim Har=
ris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable compu=
ter that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC.=20
By the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable com=
puter, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, its =
fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in sale=
s, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup.=20
Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other ventu=
res. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services an=
d network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman.=20
Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for dec=
ades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief executi=
ve at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's grow=
th and development.=20
Jordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years =
and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company's=
 regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business that=
 is now called Reliant Resources.=20
Jordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental in=
 the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use of =
public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets.=20
Jordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board a=
nd many other civic groups.=20
Chuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companies=
, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports.=20
Watson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as pr=
esident until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989.=20
Recently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited partn=
ership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football Lea=
gue franchise. It begins playing next year.=20
Watson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team.=20
Watson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve the=
 use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an earli=
er deal to use public money to build the facility.=20
Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 Ol=
ympic Games.=20
To date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships t=
o students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities.=20

Recession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen th=
e spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties a=
t London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday.=20
In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, conv=
ersations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering already-=
lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the ex=
it of several important participants from the metals business.
Cuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of th=
e usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said.=20
"Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few days=
 of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on th=
eir companies' advice," said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in Lo=
ndon.=20
Indeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guests=
 expected at its satellite activities have canceled.=20
Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revised=
 downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept. =
11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown.=20
Just this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME cas=
h copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to indus=
trial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down from=
 an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton.=20
Producers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports =
and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential f=
or copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said.=20
With demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to t=
he producers to make moves on the supply side.=20
In copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as t=
he recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. However=
, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so far f=
or some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive.=20
Elsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the =
LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton.=20
The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely b=
e a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration due =
to its large debt load, dealers said.=20
But aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likely=
 be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their comm=
itment to the metals business, market participants said.=20
In the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business =
and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.BNS=
) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this mont=
h, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all these =
moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making activ=
ities in the metals business earlier this year.=20
Who's next?=20
"It could be anyone," is the refrain from nearly all market participants sur=
veyed.=20
