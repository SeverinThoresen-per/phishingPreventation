Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA=
 GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone numb=
er is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before=
 we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's requ=
est, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the =
GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of=
 the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming part=
y under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allo=
wing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI h=
as been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd d=
ay of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.=
2 to read "30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Mo=
nth". =20

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words "or interruptible" should be deleted from this provision.  The =
interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals un=
der this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provisi=
on as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 =
business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for rec=
eipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whe=
ther the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 b=
usiness days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term "letter" from the requirement that=
 the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pa=
y. =20
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated wi=
thout prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change th=
is to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that =
she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notic=
e.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant langu=
age should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension i=
s 52722. =20
