Danny,
=20
Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afterno=
on I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's se=
ats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It tur=
ned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winner=
s turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure =
to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday Brad took Jodie=
 Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.  Today D=
annis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to t=
he game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this agai=
n next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).

Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town t=
o go to the game with Mike Bryant and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner fo=
r them after the game.  Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel wi=
ll join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in st=
oping by.

Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.

I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key log=
istics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangeme=
nts. =20
