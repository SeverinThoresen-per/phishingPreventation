Dan,


I think that given that there was a transfer of gas balances on the books=20
from HPLR to ECT on 2/1/99, we need to show the transfer of the Operative=20
Agreement rights and obligations to ECT first.  We can use the very same for=
m=20
to effect a transfer of ECT's interest on to HPL  effective July 1, 1999,=20
with an acknowledgment of gas balances Schedule that will reflect the change=
s=20
in each parties balance on July 1, 1999.  I know its more work, but I want i=
t=20
to track reality for when we face any investor/bank inquiries.  Let me know=20
if your thoughts differ.

Steve
