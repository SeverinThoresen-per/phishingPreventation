Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals=20
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara=20
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN=20
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someon=
e=20
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Prod Mo. Entity     Point  Volume  Total Amount  Sitara #
1/2000  Midcon Texas Gas Services Corp. 0984132 20000  $51,600.00 157006
2/2000  Midcon Texas Gas Services  0984132 36000  $90,900.00 166523
2/2000  Midcon Texas Pipeline Corp.  0984132 80,000  $206,800.00 170133


Please let me know as soon as possible what you find out.  The 2/2000=20
production invoices are due to be paid 3/27.

Thank You,
