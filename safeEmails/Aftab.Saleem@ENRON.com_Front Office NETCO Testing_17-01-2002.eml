 migration by early afternoon. The objectives for this meeting will be:

1. Validate front office deal entry scenarios for EOL, Sitara, EnPower, TDS =
and TAGG/ERMS
2. Execute sample scenarios
3. Review the integration testing effort for tomorrow with connectivity to t=
he back office applications

Please let us know if you have any questions.
Thanks
Aftab
