In the course of negotiating a master close-out netting agreement with J Aro=
n/Goldman Sachs, they have now requested that after signing the Netting Agre=
ement that we turn our attention to negotiating a Master Gas Purchase and Sa=
le Agreement (I assume two, one for US and one for Canada) to replace the GT=
Cs currently used for the US and Canadian trades.

Tanya: Could you have the appropriate person in Credit prepare a credit work=
sheet so Jeff/Peter's teams can prepare the draft Masters?=20

Thanks, Alan
