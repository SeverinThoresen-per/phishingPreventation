Rick:=20
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations an=
d=20
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting=20
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from=20
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing=20
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support". =20
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give=20
Houston the final say.  =20

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA=20
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), an=
d=20
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month,=20
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay. =20
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit=20
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams=
=20
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation=20
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the=20
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is=20
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market=20
basis, but rather on accounting basis. =20
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely=20
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added=20
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated=
=20
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to=20
complete phase II which we are refusing). =20
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy=20
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW=
=20
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such=20
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks=20
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every=20
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and=20
solved. =20
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest=20
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them=20
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned=
=20
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing th=
e=20
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the=20
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the=20
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment=20
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825=
=20
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the=20
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of=20
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there=20
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for=20
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to=
=20
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice. =20

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you=20
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards
