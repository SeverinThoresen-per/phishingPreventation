Subject:	Major Opps on the savings plan!

Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was m=
entioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled. =
 I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; when =
I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had been =
canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line =
since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal con=
tributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken plac=
e--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this si=
te very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the s=
ystem we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the sy=
stem when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of statin=
g that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that the=
re was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at t=
he closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-=
- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, i=
f they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price=
, what happened to the float?

I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to =
me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as they=
 see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reported a=
nd clarified.

Thanks in advance!=20
