Before I respond to Chris on this, it brings up a question.  I know we=20
included the cost of the parking service in the true up, but what about the=20
value of the gas?  If gas was parked, then we received free gas---did we=20
account for this somewhere in the deal  (i.e., it should be a positive to=20
ENA)?  If so, then the question on the sale of this gas is simple--was it a=20
one day swing sale to CES-Retail or was it part of the base load package,=20
then bill that price accordingly.  If we got the gas for free, then that's a=
=20
different story.

Please let me know what was booked for this deal.   Thanks.

We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,24=
8=20
dts and the price is $2.22. =20
I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR th=
e=20
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for=20
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a=20
wholesale transaction.
