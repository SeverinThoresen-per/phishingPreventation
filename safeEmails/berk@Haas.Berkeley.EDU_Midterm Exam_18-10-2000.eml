I have made up the midterm exam.  Since I had finished the midterm by
Tuesday's class, but not yet on Monday's class, here is what I revealed in
Tuesday's lecture that I did not know on monday.  Everything is subject to
change.

1) Currently the midterm consists of 8 questions.
2) In addition there is an extra credit question.  This question is VERY
difficult (I never give extra credit easily), and should definitely not be
attempted until you have finished everything else.
3) The questions are arranged approximately in order of difficulty.  Please
try not to throw away points by making mistakes on the gimme questions.
4) The last few questions are harder, so don't waste too much time on the
easy questions.  Still, 2 hours should be more than sufficient to do the
midterm. (I expect most people to finish in 1.5 hours.) I would give you
longer, but the time limit is actually for your benifit.  If I give you more
time, all that happens is students tend to obsess.  I have actually
witnessed students cross out a perfectly correct answer and replace it with
the incorrect one!
5) Finally, I would have to say that this midterm is a little harder than
ones I have given in the past.  Hopefully, you will ace it anyway, at least
that is my expectation based on my experience in the classroom.

Good luck !!!!!
