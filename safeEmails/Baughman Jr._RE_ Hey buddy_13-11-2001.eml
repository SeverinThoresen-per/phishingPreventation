Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly im=
pact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look li=
ke in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due to=
 it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract, abo=
ut a month ago.

How is your gig?

Best wishes,

Hi Don,

How's everything going for you, haven't talk to you in a long time.

Are the financial difficulties at Enron effecting you much?
