Hi Ken,

I am delighted that the City Council approved the interlocal agreement for
the new arena. What a powerful statement for the importance of the arena
your and Don's leadership provides. After that, the election ought to be
easy. All of us are grateful to you both. I'll be at the press conference.
Please call on me at anytime that I can help.

Please give my regards to Linda.

Warmly,

Alex
