A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a recor=
d=20
of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The=
=20
price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If yo=
u=20
don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February=20
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a=20
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on hi=
s=20
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not=20
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.
