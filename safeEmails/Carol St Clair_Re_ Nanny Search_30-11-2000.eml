you - I'm not sure what the grand total would be.  Good luck again with nann=

search.  Glad to hear that everyone is well.  Hard to believe, but Britta, m=

Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return=20
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly=20
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes=20
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after=20
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look=

forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in=20
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me=

know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help=
=20
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or=20
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the marke=
t=20
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not goin=
g=20
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary:
I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you=20
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for=
=20
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please=
=20
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila=
 =20
contributing.  Are you interested?
