Barry,
 Can you elaborate on what you are referring to about AOS daily balancing=20

Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm=20
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they=20
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm dea=
l.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a=20
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.
