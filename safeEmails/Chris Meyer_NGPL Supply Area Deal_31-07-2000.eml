I've renegotiated the 400,000 MMBtu/day supply area deal on NGPL.  The=20
primary delivery points have not changed. The new (receipt) paths, volumes=20
and rates are below.  I'll forward the actual receipt points along with the=20
amended contract once complete.  Essentially, this new structure=20
significantly reduces our commodity costs to points west of 346 and slightly=
=20
reduces (50%) commodity costs east of 346.  Please remember that secondary=20
deliveries to points east of 346 (with the exception of Sonat Erath) still=20
include a volumetric (demand) adder $0.02 Dth for STX receipts and $0.025 fo=
r=20
all other receipts.   Deliveries to Sonat Erath will be an additional $0.02=20
MMbtu.  Let me know if you have any issues ASAP.  I want to make this=20
effective August 1.
