Subject: Gas Marketing Affiliate Rule

Joe and Christi, I would like your reaction to this notion.  On the gas side=
,=20
FERC is revisiting the marketing affiliate rule and code of conduct.  One=20
repeated refrain coming from non-affiliated marketers is that the definition=
=20
of marketing affiliate needs to refined to include electric=20
generators/merchant plants affiliated with the pipeline.  There is a concern=
=20
that since they are not covered by the existing rule, they get preferential=20
treatment (timing, info, rates) that gives an advantage to the affiliate's=20
projects over those planned by third parties.  Would we object to changing=20
the definition so that these entities are considered marketing affiliates?  =
I=20
would be inclined to go along with the change, if it doesn't hurt us.  Let m=
e=20
know. Thanks. =20
