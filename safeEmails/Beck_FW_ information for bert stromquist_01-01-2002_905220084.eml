Sally ...
I thought I would pass this on.=20

It started with some unidentified boxes which Shirley Birch was trying to lo=
cate.  I do not think Carolyn Gilley is here any longer.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyon=
e knows anything. =20

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of co=
nference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are a=
pproxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong t=
o AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information =
that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gil=
ley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and re=
moving the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to =
us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs f=
or the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team o=
f contractors to complete this.

No.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl=
 Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.  Can we get more s=
pecific information as to the contents and whether they are labled as HPL or=
 not?
