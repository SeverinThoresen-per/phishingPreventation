Vince-

1. We can detect "hoarding" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis agains=
t=20
the actual inflow.

2. We can detect "market power" by dissociating the seller from the buyer,=20
distinguishing between the physical "cost" in gas to run the generators and=20
the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.

3. (As you noted) We can detect "storage" as the difference between inflow=20
and consumption.

It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward mode=
l=20
of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market=20
prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizin=
g=20
capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas=20
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for=
=20
the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors:=20
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can "calibrate" the=20
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price=20
elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding,=20
from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis=20
trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storag=
e=20
and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and=20
each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally=
,=20
flows are "explained" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if=20
necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of=20
the weather.

I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a=
=20
model.
