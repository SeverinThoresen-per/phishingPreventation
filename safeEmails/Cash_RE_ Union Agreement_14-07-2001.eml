My sincere congratulations to  entire negotiation team, specially to Lourdes=
 and Vicente, for  me particularly it has been a pleasure to work with you  =
and I must say that  being part of a  team  that  has the abilities and  kno=
wledge as this one  does is  refreshing.
We have achieved and surpassed  the  goals  defined in  our strategy and mos=
t important we have left EcoElectrica with  in a good position to handle its=
elf  in presence of a union, which is not  an easy thing to achieve, we have=
 also established the  grounds  for a solid open relationship without compro=
mising any managerial principle or economic objective. All in all a job well=
 done!.
 Thanks to all it's been great working with you all.
Regards, Teo
