Subject:	Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan




A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read =
this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages =
after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be =
rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, =
Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has =
been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are =
finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 3=
1st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as eac=
h trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be availab=
le at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with y=
our backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are fi=
nished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed d=
ial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece =
of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we=
 ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the numb=
er lists as a last resort.
=20
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special=
 needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need t=
o be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring=
 supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work e=
nvironment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit =
access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a =
work stoppage. =20

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows: =20

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to mov=
e to the backup location. =20

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown oc=
curs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to =
make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup locati=
on as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distribut=
ed.
