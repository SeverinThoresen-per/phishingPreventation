EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 act=
ive books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide inform=
ation to us in a timely and accurate fashion. (I wish I could get the rest o=
f the company to this point). I'm told that the people referenced below have=
 contributed in a big way to this effort. Thanks for the effort. Rick

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( i=
ncluding Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts=
 in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over Glob=
al Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( Ho=
uston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as for=
 us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of bus=
iness next day.
