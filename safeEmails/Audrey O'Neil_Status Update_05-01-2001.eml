Ken-

I finally talked to Gerald live a few minutes ago.  We've been trading=20
calls.  He requested that you write up what you want to say in a "letter of=20
intent" and forward it to him for his review, comments and inclusion of the=20
non-binding clause.  As for the sample Gas Processing Contract, he has to=20
check and see if we can release Enron's contract to you for use by Crescendo=
=2E

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Audrey
