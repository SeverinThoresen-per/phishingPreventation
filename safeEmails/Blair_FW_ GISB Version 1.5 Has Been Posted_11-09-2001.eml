Subject:	GISB Version 1.5 Has Been Posted

Version 1.5 of the GISB standards has been posted to the GISB Web site.  The=
 next step in the process is for the GISB office to send the standards to th=
e FERC.  The implementation date of the standards is set by the FERC.  You'l=
l be notified as this process progresses.

Electronic copies of the version 1.5 standards books can be downloaded direc=
tly from GISB's Web site (www.gisb.org/frameset.htm).  To locate the books, =
click on 'STANDARDS' in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  The v=
ersion 1.5 standards books will be located at the top of the page.  You'll n=
eed the ETS logon ID and password.  Please call Alma Carrillo (-36503) if yo=
u need the ID and password.  Please remember that this is an ETS' ID and pas=
sword -- it is for the use of ETS' employees.  (NOTE:  The posting for the E=
DM standards book shows a date of November 15, 1999.  This is only a typo on=
 the Web page.  The actual book is dated June 18, 2001.)

Paper copies of the version 1.5 standards will be available.  Early next wee=
k Alma Carrillo will distribute a form for requesting paper copies.  We will=
 coordinate this effort for the Houston people.  I'll let you know the coord=
inator for Omaha.  You can also print the standards directly from the GISB W=
eb site. =20

Please let me know if you need help obtaining the standards books or have fu=
rther questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
