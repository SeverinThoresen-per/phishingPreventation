Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because th=
e=20
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn=20
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsisten=
t=20
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to=20
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am=20
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to=20
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What i=
s=20
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b=
)=20
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default=20
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability=20
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master=20
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Carol
