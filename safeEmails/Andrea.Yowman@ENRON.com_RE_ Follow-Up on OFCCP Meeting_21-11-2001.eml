Michelle - can you respond?  I haven't seen anything.  Also, after our meeti=
ng we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at l=
east going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunit=
y to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I w=
ould like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resol=
ution.

Michelle and Steve,
Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corp=
orate Management Review?  This is the letter we are expecting as a result of=
 your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago.

Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay=
?  Can you please let me know?  Thanks so much.

Regards,
Sandra
