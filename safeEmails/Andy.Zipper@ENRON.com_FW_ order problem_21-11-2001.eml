Hi Andy,

When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to=
 Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night.=
  Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned=
 or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unab=
le to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill befo=
re he can get to it.

We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we =
will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recove=
ry, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  =
Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given t=
he present circumstances.
