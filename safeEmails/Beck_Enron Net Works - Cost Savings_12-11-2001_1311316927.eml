We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return =
from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.  For each business =
unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings=
 on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below. =20

	Scenario 1:	Enron exits the line of business, with immediate headcount redu=
ctions and cost savings quantified;
			skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount=
 reductions and cost
			savings quantified (Lights Out)

	Scenario 2:	Enron retains and maintains line of business, but does not inve=
st for growth; assumes no further systems=20
			enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (L=
ights On - But Dim)

	Scenario 3:	Enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommod=
ate known market changes; service levels=20
			are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights O=
n - Brighter)=20

Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following le=
vel of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM:

	EGM:	Freight Markets					EIM:	Forest Products
		FX/IR/Equity						Steel
		Domestic Crude & Products
		International Crude & Products
		Domestic Coal
		International Coal

Cost savings have been identified for ENW's unallocated expense and capital =
as well.  We have worked with HR to adjust cost savings for anticipated seve=
rance costs. =20
