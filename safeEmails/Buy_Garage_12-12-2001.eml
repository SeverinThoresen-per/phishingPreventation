Bill- there is no issue with the garage as yet. Subsidy is still in place an=
d bills are being paid per Steve Kean and Steve Woods. If you want to move t=
o new garage it probably can be arranged. Let me know and I can get the pers=
on to get it started for you and anyone else. I think there is plenty of par=
king available. Rick
