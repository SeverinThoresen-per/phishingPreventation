The Wall Street Journal's net effective general ad rate will be up 3.3%.  US=
A Today's general rate will go up 4%, as it has in recent years.  The Housto=
n Chronicle plans to raise daily ad rates about 5%, only slightly below last=
 year's hike, said Gary Randazzo, senior vice president of sales and marketi=
ng. "While the downturn is significant now, ... we think that, because of th=
e [federal] stimulus package, ... next year may begin getting back to some n=
ormalcy," he said, adding that advertisers may benefit from wider use of vol=
ume discounts.  Let's hope that advertisers are willing to pay, as ad dollar=
s comprise a significant portion of newspapers' revenues...
