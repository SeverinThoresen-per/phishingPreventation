Troy,
 It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the=20
proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to=20
their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things=20
don't happen. =20

FYI,

It is unfortunate that we lose business due to a simple confidentiality=20
agreement.  Dan, I do appreciate your efforts with this matter.

Troy

Troy -

I appreciate the time you took to have Enron's legal department review the=20
non-disclosure agreement.  Unfortunately, Silgan cannot accept the requested=
=20
changes, and specifically the deletion of paragraph 5.  As a result we have=20
decided not to pursue a business relationship with Enron.

Thanks again for your time.

Michael Vogt
