Davette,=20
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter=
=20
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at=20
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside o=
f=20
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage=20
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the=20
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly=20
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight an=
d=20
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We tr=
y=20
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have=20
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church,=20
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really=20
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with u=
s=20
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hur=
t=20
we hurt. : )


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn
