Casey,
=20
A plan to complete the "J9" issue has been reached.
=20
Basically, the solution is based on the following key point:
The number that is used to correct "J9" is from "Swap Liq.xls". =20
=20
Swap Liq.xls procedures and functions are:=20
1: manually Via PortCol to ftp two files to local PC=20
2 gets a comparison result between a pare of swap liq under the same region/=
book based on the two files
=20
The design for this project is:
1: to save time, AUTOMATICALLY/DIRECTLY AND  WITHOUT Via PortCol  to ftp all=
 files to a M Folder. The files are belonged to a giving portfolio and date=20
2. compare Swap Liq for all pair files (for every pair,  the comparison resu=
lt  just is exact as current "Swap Liq.xls")
3. if a difference is found from a pair files,  then value in "J9" in the de=
sk tab and the region roll file will be changhed to "J9 minus the number" an=
d the number also will be put in the column based on the date
4. the partially or all of above procedures may with or separate from DprAut=
omation if there is necessary
=20
I need confirm with you about EXACTLY PROCEDURE about HOW TO GET THE NUMBER =
FROM "Swap Liq.xls" to  correct "J9". One of the macros will basically funct=
ions the way you give to me.
=20
Also what is the title for new column in roll file for Swap Liq.=20
=20
The short term goal for this project is to try to make J9 work at the correc=
t way under acceptable time period (in 20 minutes for a portfolio) before Ne=
tco starts trading. Long term goal will be speed and better interface or eve=
n reach a solution to take care this once for all from AdHoc database table.=
=20
=20
Please let me know when you have chance to guide me through/or e-mail the pr=
ocedure about how to get the number to correct J9.
=20
Please let me know if there is any concern.=20
=20
Thank you very much!
=20
