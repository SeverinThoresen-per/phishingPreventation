Debra,

I sent a hard copy of the GISB amendment to Kimberly Gentle of the above ref=
erenced company.  She said they executed the amendment and sent it overnight=
 to us on 10/17 and it was signed by our mailroom on Oct. 19, 2001.  She cal=
led to find out whether we have received it.  I asked her to fax me a copy o=
f the executed GISB but she couldn't find her copy and that's why she wanted=
 to make sure that we received our copy.  Please let me know because I need =
to get back to her.

Thanks,


Ann
