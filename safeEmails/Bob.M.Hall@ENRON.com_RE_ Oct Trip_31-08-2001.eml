Stacey, since I am coming to Houston on Oct 11 and 12, I was planning to sta=
y over a Sat night to save some money. Without staying over the Sat the tick=
et is currently at about 1,600 but the ticket I purchased is at about 250. S=
ince I would be in Houston for 5 days I would like Jess to come down at that=
 time. Would Enron be willing to buy Jess' ticket as well since I would be s=
taying over the Sat? Her ticket would be some where around 400 since prices =
have changed in the last few days. I would be paying for Brandon's ticket.

John
