Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into=
 the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case =
something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have=
 for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

t by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,
