I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and=
 they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woma=
n she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other =
uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i wo=
uld be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another ma=
nager who claims she is taking care of it. =20
