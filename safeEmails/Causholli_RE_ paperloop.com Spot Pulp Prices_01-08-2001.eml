Monika,

It would appear that paperloop.com is now publishing spot pulp prices for NB=
SK and SBSK.  It wasn't clear from the description how they were compiling/o=
btaining the information to publish this pricing.  It'd be interesting to se=
e how these prices compare with the prompt contract price for pulp on the Pu=
lpex.  Any chance you could check this out for me tomorrow?  Thanks.
