We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will inc=
lude employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.  You mentioned that you=
r functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It wo=
uld certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your f=
unctional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operation=
s during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that w=
ill be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior direct=
ors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations. =20

I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC mee=
ting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a =
date has been set for your PRC. =20

Thanks. =20
