Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg=20
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm=20
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the=20
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the=20
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report=20
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim
