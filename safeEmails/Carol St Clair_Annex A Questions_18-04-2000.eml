David:
Could you please confirm the following for me:

1. With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.  For some=20
reason they were on our Annex A list.  Do you know why?

2. We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company an=
d=20
the "Columbia Gas" entities.  Again, they too were on our Annex A list.

Thanks.
