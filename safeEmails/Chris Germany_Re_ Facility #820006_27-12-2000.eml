I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.  However, I do use meter numbers=
=20
and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.  Deal=20
241639 is (term purchase from AEC) is at this meter.  And deal 511043 (ENA-I=
m=20
Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.  It=20
doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set=
=20
up in Sitara.

Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
 *  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
 *  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple=
)?
 *   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
 *  Can this change take effect 1/1/2001?
 *  If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today=
,=20
I'll buy him a "pop".

Kevin, I have included Chris Germany and Richard Pinion because they=20
requested updates to facility #820006.  There is a note on this facility fro=
m=20
Chris requesting this facility to be reactivated (10/28/99).  He would have=20
to approve inactivation.  Richard requested a name change (4/25/00).

Chris is this still a valid point?

See Screen 3 - Facility #513423 appears to have been created in error.  The=20
Norm and Trade flags are set to 'no'.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Faye

Screen 1 - Note requesting reactivation.

Screen 2 - Shows interconnect with different pipes.

Screen 3 - This facility appears to be created in error, both the Norm and=20
Trade flags are set to 'No'.

820006 is set up in Global as an interconnect between NFUL and TCPL at=20
Niagara Falls.  That is incorrect and this facility should  be changed or=20
inactivated ASAP  before any more deals get booked against it.  I believe=20
there is an interconnect between NFUL and TGP at Niagara.
Didn't we have this same problem in the spring regarding Facility#513423.
