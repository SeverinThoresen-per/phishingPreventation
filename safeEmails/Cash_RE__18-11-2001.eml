Lizzette and Ryan,

Kriste and I substantially revised the waiver agreement today, so sit tight.

Kriste, do you want to add the mediation provision?  I'll leave that to you.

Ryan,

I'm sending back down the mark ups to the rif packet you sent to me.  On the=
 waiver, I've scratched out some paragraphs and told you I would send other =
language.  This is it.  Call with questions.



4.	Employee Benefits.  Except as otherwise provided in Section ___((the para=
graph with the dollar amount)), Employee shall be entitled to receive vested=
 or accrued benefits due and payable to Employee under all employee benefit =
plans and compensation plans, subject to the terms of those plans.=20

5.3.	Cooperation.  Employee agrees that, at Company's request, he or she wil=
l devote reasonable time necessary to assist in Company's litigation matters=
, including, but not limited to, meeting with counsel, providing testimony a=
t depositions or trial, and related activities.

To the release paragraph (right after the bolded paragraph saying employee r=
eleases everything.... add this section (you may need to organize the sectio=
ns):

b.	This release does not apply to or include the consideration or benefits d=
escribed in Section 2 above or to other promises and representations contain=
ed in this Agreement.  This release also does not apply to claims which may =
arise after the date this release is signed. Employee understands that he or=
 she may challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of this release under th=
e Older Worker Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) and the ADEA before a court, t=
he Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or any state or local age=
ncy charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws, despite the rel=
ease language stated above. Employee also understands that nothing in this r=
elease prevents him or her from filing a charge or complaint with or from pa=
rticipating in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC or any s=
tate or local agency charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws=
=2E  Employee understands, however, that if he or she pursues a claim agains=
t Company under the OWBPA and/or the ADEA, Company may seek to set off the a=
mount paid to Employee for signing this release against any award he or she =
may obtain in such legal proceeding, and Company may be entitled to recover =
costs and attorney's fees incurred by the Company as specifically authorized=
 under applicable federal or state law.

Also add this:

d.	Employee acknowledges, agrees, and represents to Company that:

(i)	Employee has carefully read and fully understands the effect of the prov=
isions of this Agreement, which he or she is entering knowingly and voluntar=
ily;

(ii)	Employee has had a reasonable time of not less than 45 days in which to=
 consider this Agreement;

(iii)	Employee was advised and encouraged to consult an attorney prior to ex=
ecuting this Agreement with respect to the effect of the provisions of this =

g the age and job titles of other persons in his or her job classification o=
r organizational unit, if any, who are remaining employed with the Company, =
as well as the job titles and ages of the persons being offered payments upo=
n voluntary separation.  The voluntary separation applies to the groups, for=
 the time periods, and based on the eligibility factors set forth in the att=
ached Exhibit "A."

e date Employee signs this Agreement by delivering signed, written notice of=
 such revocation to Human Resources and as required under Section __, whereu=
pon this Agreement shall be rescinded in its entirety and become null and vo=
id. =20


Add this as well:=20

7.10	Mediation.  If a dispute arises out of or related to Employee's employm=
ent with Company, or this Agreement, and if the dispute cannot be settled th=
rough direct discussions, then Company and Employee agree to try to settle t=
he dispute in an amicable manner by confidential mediation before having rec=
ourse to any other proceeding or forum.


Please send it to me again, and I will help organize as needed and check to =
see if we need to add any other major provisions. =20
