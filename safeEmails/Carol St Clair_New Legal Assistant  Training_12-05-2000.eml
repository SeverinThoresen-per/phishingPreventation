best for you and what didn't work.   I will keep whatever you say=20
confidential.  I also have discussed with Mark that I want you to play a=20
significant role in the training process given the outstanding progress that=
=20
you have made in the last year.  Could you also give that some thought and=20
let me know what you think?  Thanks.
