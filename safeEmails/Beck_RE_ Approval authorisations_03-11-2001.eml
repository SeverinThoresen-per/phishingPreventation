Sally,

In the event that a manual payment needs to be sent, I need your approval to=
 set up Jenny Latham, my lead in London, and Rebecca Millerchip, settlements=
 lead for EGM for them to sign off.  As we are moving to replicate the EGM p=
ayment process in London for EIM, utilizing EGM resources, this should only =
be a temporary need because EIM's payment templates are not fully set up in =
SAP yet.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,

Kevin

Kevin,

We were going to Mike/Fernley for this since that was per policy.  If we're =
going to ask for exceptions then it makes sense for me to be set up for manu=
al payments over $1 mil.  Nathalie had mentioned this issue to Becky while s=
he was helping her, and Becky is obviously offering to help.  Let me know if=
 you agree.  Thanks.  Jenny.

Rick - Sorry to bother you with this but Treasury is requiring your approval=
=2E  London Operations currently has only one person (Cindy Horn) authorized=
 to approve manual payments.  Obviously this can be a problem if Cindy is ou=
t of the office.  I would like to gain authorizaiton for Becky Millerchip in=
 London, who manages the Coordination and Settlements groups and reports to =
Cindy, to approve manual payments.  Can you help us with this?

Thanks,=20

It is my understanding that any delegation of manual payment approval that f=
alls outside the levels set by Rick Causey need to be approved by Rick.  I r=
ealise that we do have limited numbers of staff in London with the required =
approval level but we need to be sure that we can accept deviations from the=
 policy.

following Rick Causey's e-mail re controls over manual payments, I have been=
 asked to get you to approve a list of Accounting Directors in our area who =
will be required to sign off on all manual payments of more than USD1mil in =
value.

Cindy Horn is the only Director in our group so naturally she should be the =
primary signatory.

Since manual payments are only done in extreme circumstances, they are usual=
ly very last minute and need to be signed off immediately in order to not mi=
ss Treasury deadlines and incur unnecessary late payment charges.  I really =
feel that it would be in the interest of the company to have more than one a=
uthorised signatory for manual payments.

Although I am Manager and not Director, how would you feel about me being a =
back up for Cindy if she is not around?

Thanks

Subject:	Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval =
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate Acco=
unts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice image=
s for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be implement=
ed until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be implemente=
d by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and correct ge=
neral ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following approval a=
uthorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests and wire t=
ransfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two approva=
ls:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting Director=
 approval of the general ledger coding. =20

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an Acc=
ounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not a=
ttached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of=
 you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting Direc=
tors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this inf=
ormation to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to p=
rovide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be proc=
essed.
