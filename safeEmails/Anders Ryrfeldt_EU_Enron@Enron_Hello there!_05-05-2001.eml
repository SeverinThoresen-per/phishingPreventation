You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm curre=
ntly working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by Cap G=
emini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess and En=
ron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around Euro=
pe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice pla=
ce to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a challang=
ening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our h=
ouse and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it=
 all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!

/ Anders
