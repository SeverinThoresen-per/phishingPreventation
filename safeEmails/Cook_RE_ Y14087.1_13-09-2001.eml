When a crude financial derivative transaction is subject to an ISDA Master a=
greement, the use of the language "NYMEX Trading Day" in reference to Floati=
ng Price does not fit the correct definitional ISDA structure.  It should be=
 "Commodity Business Day".  Please see that the appropriate financial deriva=
tive confirmation templates are revised accordingly.  If you have any questi=
ons, please call.

Currently, the use of NYMEX Trading Day is correct when used with a GTC/Anne=
x A financial omnibus form as it does fit the definitional structure.  We wi=
ll advise if and when this is changed.

Thank you.
