In addition to the Concentration Limit NA Gas P/L notification issued below,=
 I believe there should also be a P/L Notification on NA Gas Commodity Group=
 Limit, but the DPR reporting does not reflect it currently.  Lavorato has a=
 "Cross-Commodity" line on the Business Unit DPR that reflected $18,670 MM V=
aR and ($23,583 MM) P/L.  This does not roll up into the NA Gas Commodity Gr=
oup line which had $55,509 VaR and ($67,838 MM) P/L, both below the $85 MM C=
ommodity Group limit, but it was appropriately included in the Business Unit=
 VaR and P/L. =20

I obtained the detail of this cross-commodity line by reviewing the Concentr=
ation Limit DPR:

	VaR	P/L	=09
Gas	  18,580 	  (24,659)	 (a)=09
Power	       233 	        376 	=09
Residual Fuel		        545 	=09
F/X		        155 	=09
Total		  (23,583)	=09
			=09
Business Unit DPR:			=09
NA Gas	  55,509 	  (67,838)	=09
Gas in Cross-Commodity		  (24,659)	 (a)=09
Total		  (92,497)	=09
			=09


According to the Policy, all commodities traded within a business unit shoul=
d have a limit approved by the CRO.  I can see how we might want to allow so=
me leeway in the application of that requirement, but not to the extent of $=
18.6 MM VaR.  So my recommendation is:

1) Require the Gas and Power position in Lavorato's cross-commodity books to=
 be rolled up into Gas and Power Commodity Group results on the Business Uni=
t DPR, and compared to the Commodity Group VaR limits established for Gas an=
d Power.  This would not have caused a VaR violation today as we recently in=
creased the commodity group limit for Gas to $85 MM, only a P/L notification=
=2E  And while Power is not material now, it has been in the past, and could=
 easily be again, and Power is a standard Americas commodity group.

2) Grant an "Other" VaR limit of $X (a small amount) that authorizes Lavorat=
o to trade other commodities. That at least limits this other activity and w=
ill require him to discuss with the you if he wants to take an exceptionally=
 large position in a commodity other than Gas and Power.

I think protecting the integrity of the Commodity Group limits is also impor=
tant from the perspective that the Business Unit management is not really re=
sponsible for the Concentration Limit DPR (Lavorato and Kitchen do not even =
have access to view it!), and they are not on the distribution list for noti=
fications on those limits. So as far as Lavorato/Kitchen is concerned, as cu=
rrently reported they had no P/L notifications today as Power made some inco=
me so the business unit only lost ($97MM) vs it's $100 MM VaR limit. But the=
 company lost ($119 MM) on gas, as noted in the e-mail below, and proper rep=
orting of all of Lavorato's gas and power positions in comparison to his cor=
responding Commodity Group limits would have resulted in a Commodity Group P=
/L notification of ($92 MM) vs. the $85 MM limit.

We already eliminated all the position limits for Gas and Power.  Although t=
he Concentration Limit DPR is accurately reflecting activity, we should prob=
ably make sure the VaR and P/L is being clearly reported on the Business Uni=
t DPR as well, as that is the one that much of management of the company is =
still focused on.

Do you agree?   We can discuss when you're back in the office.

Regards,
Cassandra.
