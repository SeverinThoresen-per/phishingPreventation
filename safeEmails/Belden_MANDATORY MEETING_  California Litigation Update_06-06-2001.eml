Given all of the recent news about California-related litigation, I thought =
that it would be a good idea to hold an information session for people on th=
e desk about what is happening with Enron on this front.  I have asked Richa=
rd Sanders, who is ENA's chief litigation lawyer, to make a special trip to =
Portland to talk to us about it.  He will be prepared to review the foundati=
on of all of the current lawsuits that are ongoing and what these lawsuits m=
ean to Enron and to us as traders and marketers. =20

I strongly encourage you to come to this meeting as I think that you'll find=
 it very useful.=20

Date:  Thursday, June 7
Time:  3:30 p.m.
Place: Mt. Hood
Re:      Update by Richard Sanders

Please confirm with Debra that you have received this and that you intend to=
 attend.  Let me know if you can't make it.
