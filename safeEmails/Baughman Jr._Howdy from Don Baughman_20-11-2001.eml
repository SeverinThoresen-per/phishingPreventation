Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried =
to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to catch=
 up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger. =20

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In addit=
ion, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  W=
e are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.  I am doing w=
ell at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and trading.  Enron,=
 as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some trouble.  We are reason=
ably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002.  Family is doing we=
ll; my sister is about to have her second baby.  Travis is back from his yea=
r and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account ma=
nager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of h=
unting & fishing.  Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, de=
er hunting. =20

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired! FANTASTIC!=
  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?  Hopefully consuming =
large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy B=
uffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the hous=
e and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

Adios,
