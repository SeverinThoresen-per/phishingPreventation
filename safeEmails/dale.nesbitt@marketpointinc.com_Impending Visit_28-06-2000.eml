Vince:

I sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
at your offices on July 5 or July 7 in Houston to follow up our earlier
discussions.  I notice I have two email addresses for you, so I am sending
this to both.  I am not sure the earlier transmission got to you.

Would you be available the afternoon of the 5th or the morning of the 7th to
continue our earlier discussions?  Give me an email or phone shout at
650.218.3069.

Thanks

Dale Nesbitt
