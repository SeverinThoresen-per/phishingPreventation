but am having trouble with certain of the functions.  I will work with HR=20
here to get this done.  I selected the same list of reviewers online that I=20
emailed you earlier.  Thanks.

ESA is in the middle of doing mid year reviews.  They have an automated=20
system which I do not think I have access to because I work for ENA.  HR her=
e=20
is checking on how I can do the reviews for Andrea, Cecilia and Pia. =20

With respect to ENA, if you are doing midyear reviews I would suggest the=20
following reviewers, yourself, Lynn Aven, Andrea Calo, Maria Pia Beccaccini,=
=20
and Mike Guerriero.

Let me know if I need to do anything else.=20

Thanks,
