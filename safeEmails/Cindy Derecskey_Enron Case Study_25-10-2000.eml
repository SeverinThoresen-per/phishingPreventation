Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself.  I currently work with Christie Patrick an=
d=20
Michael B Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with yo=
u=20
and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case study. =
=20
Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few convenient=
=20
times that work with your schedule.  I will work with our management and do=20
my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews that fit with your=20
outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with: Ken Lay - chairman and CEO, Jeff=
=20
Skilling - president and COO, and Andy Fastow - CFO.  If you feel that you=20
may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to work=
=20
something out the same day, so you don't have to travel back here.  I will=20
forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once the=20
interviews are scheduled.  Do you anticipate drafting specific questions?  I=
f=20
so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch base=
=20
very soon.

Regards,
