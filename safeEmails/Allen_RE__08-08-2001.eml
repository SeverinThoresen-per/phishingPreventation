Ceci,

I received the list of properties you mailed.  Thank you very much.  I
would like to stay updated on the market in Hood River and the
surrounding areas in Washington as well.  I would be interested in lots
as well as homes.  In case you don't still have it, my address is 8855
Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
