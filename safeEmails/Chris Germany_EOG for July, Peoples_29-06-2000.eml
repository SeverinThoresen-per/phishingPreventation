ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio=20
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take=20
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would=
=20
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from=20
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it look=
s=20
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi=
=20
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was=20
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may=20
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in=20
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer=20
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this=20
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.
