I got a call from Rome's lawyer, who wants to call the whole thing off becau=
se he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants.  I told him we were ready =
and willing to proceed.  He was going to call the mediator to see if he coul=
d cancel without incurring the mediation fees.  So, I'll keep you posted.  M=

Michelle:
 I am currently leading the due diligence effort for Northern Natural Gas an=
d Transwestern Pipeline as it relates to the Dynegy merger.  Dynegy has sche=
duled an all day due diligence session this Thursday beginning at 9 a.m. whi=
ch obviously conflicts with the Bill Rome Mediation.  First thought: can we =
re-schedule? Second thought: the Dynegy meeting will be here at Enron - I ca=
n be in and out of the meeting but need to be here in the building.  In addi=
tion, how long will this take?  I would rather not re-schedule the mediation=
 if at all possible but can't re-schedule the Dynegy meeting either.

Kevin
