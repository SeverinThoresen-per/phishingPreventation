Dear Stacey-

What is your view point on this?  It appears to me that what Rod is saying i=
s that this is not a valid doorstep finding because of the other controls th=
at they have around the process.  However, I would think that commercial hav=
ing a credit watch report would be beneficial at the beginning of each tradi=
ng day (or at least a list of the CP's that are approaching their limits) so=
 they know what CP to focus on.  What are thoughts?  Does commercial here ge=
t a credit watch report daily?  Do they use it?  Please call me to discuss w=
hen you get a chance.  Thanks, Stacey.  I appreciate your input.

Christy

Let's discuss when Minna returns (next Monday).  Simply providing the exposu=
re relative to credit lines does not indicate that the next transaction is c=
redit approved - and I am concerned that this would be construed as such.  B=
ecause positions are volatile, the tenor and size of the next transaction al=
so determine approval.  As well, contractual terms play a role in the approv=
al of the next transaction.  For example, with margining rights above a cont=
ractual level, exposure can be actively managed.  Clearly, a real time appro=
ach which capture exposure and potential exposure against 'soft' and contrac=
tual lines would be ideal.  Senior management in RAC is aware of this object=
ive and efforts are underway to improve systems towards this end. =20

Nevertheless, if you think that a CreditWatch list would assist the commerci=
al team in managing credit risk in this market, I am sure that some report c=
ould be generated periodically. =20

Dear Rod/Minna-

Thank you for the response.  I apologize for the confusion.  I understand wh=
at is being said about the allocation of resources, but how is commercial in=
formed when a counterparty is approaching their credit limit?  I think the f=
inding is that a real-time credit system would be ideal, but that the curren=
t IT environment does not support it.  I think that what is being said is th=
at commercial should understand where counterparties stand before the tradin=
g day starts.  Or even if just the report lists those counterparties which a=
re approaching their limits.  Is that something that is easily pulled togeth=
er on a daily basis?  Please advise.  Thanks,

Christy Lobusch

Christy, Orjan:

I apologize for not responding earlier.  To be perfectly honest, I had assum=
ed that Minna Taponen (who manages credit risk for Nordic) was copied on the=
 correspondence.  We should probably speak to clarify on issues, but below i=
s my initial comment.

Currently, credit is managed on a pre-approval consent basis. No counterpart=
y is approved until the commercial team has made such a request and a review=
 is performed and lines set.  This is not say that the 'rules' are not occas=
ionally violated, but the credit approval system is in place.  RAC/CRM could=
 generate a CreditWatch list, but this would not necessarily improve the pro=
cess or reduce credit risk.  Minna could produce and maintain such a report,=
 but I would require to justify that this is a worthwhile allocation of her =
resource.

Thanks,
Rod

Your name is all over this...how would you like me to handle? We can do this=
 from a systems perspective easily but I don't think that's the issue.

Let me know.

Dear Debbie-

I don't know if you are the person that I need to talk to, but I was hoping =
you could point me to who I need to talk to about getting a credit watch rep=
ort distributed to the Oslo commercial team.  Also, do you know if the issue=
 is really that the report is not prepared and distributed or is it just tha=
t the report is not distributed.  Please advise.  Thanks, Debbie.

Her'e sthe comments regardiong Credit from the Oslo review. Could you please=
 adress this issue to someone in Credit and give me some feedback?

I've sent it to Rod Nelson several times as I thought he was the right perso=
n, but he never gave any answer.

Thanks!

=D8rjan



Observation
No Credit Watch Report is distributed for commercial personnel to reference.

Root cause
Credit support has been managed in London by a RAC resource which has preven=
ted a complete set of credit tools from being developed.   =20


Action step
Agree. Credit limit monitoring should be performed on a real time basis. Thi=
s is being restricted by the current IT environment. In the interim a daily =
report should be prepared and distributed to traders showing counterparty li=
mits and current utilisation of those limits.


Responsible
Rod Nelson, Credit
