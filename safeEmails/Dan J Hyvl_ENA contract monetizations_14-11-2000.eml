Barbara & Anne,
 I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only neede=
d=20
to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred=20
to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization,=20
the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for=20
the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore,=20
transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however,=20
Joe would like as much up front notice as possible.
