Dear Bernard,

I am grateful for your reply.  I assume that you need nothing further in the=
=20
way of documentation from me regarding the liquidator issue at this time.  I=
f=20
that is not correct, I trust that you will let me know immediately.  In the=20
future, in order to streamline these matters, please include me in the=20
communication loop.  I realize that you did not know that I would be involve=
d=20
in the the process of re-extending the liquidation of EGLE.

I need your (and/or Michel's) immediate help in substituting a new=20
liquidator.  Please let me know what qualifications are necessary at your=20
earliest convenience.  I want to have the necessary papers filed in France=20
before year end unless there is a reason that this absolutely cannot be done=
=2E

Bernard,

Please call (or have your office call) or fax me Monday and let me know
whether you got the liquidator's documents that I had sent by Federal
Express to you.  I am concerned that since I heard nothing from you Friday,
you have not received them.

Britt
