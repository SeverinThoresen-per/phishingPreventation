Dear Vince & Grant,

Thanks very much for the offer to go to Houston as a Manager to work with=20
Tanya Tamarchenko on VAR and credit risk within the Houston Research Group,=20
as we discussed on the phone yesterday.  I felt that it would be useful to=20
bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this=20
morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in=20
Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine=
=20
from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an=20
urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, ha=
s=20
kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of=
=20
the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  =
I=20
expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign=20
assignment representative in the near future.

I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to=
=20
make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make=20
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working=20
with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in=20
terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement. =
=20
The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enro=
n=20
Corp is too dramatic and requires me to "burn bridges" and my return to Enro=
n=20
Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support=20
structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs=20
(flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely=
=20
reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they=20
justify making the contract a three year (local) one.

I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &=20
value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have=20
identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and a=
n=20
"Excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also=20
"Excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my=
=20
existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off=20
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,

Anjam
