Hello Ken

As we have not had a recent "daily update" from you - I write inquiring abou=
t the status of OUR company.

We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NO=
T from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in =
the management's communication philosophy.

We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday -=
 again through the press!  Communication failed again.

Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial state=
ments for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the=
 press!

Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together=
 the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals=
?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too. =20

Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  Th=
ere appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!

On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currentl=
y have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believe=
d in the company.  I also have numerous share options. =20

Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and =
in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you =
had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter pa=
rt of last year and most of this year.

Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.

I would be interested to hear your views.
