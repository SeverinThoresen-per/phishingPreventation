Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another=20
contract under HPLC and assign that one.
What do you think?  I understood that the purchaser of HPl was to get all=20
Texas deals and since this was in ENA for regulatory reasons, just like=20
Entex, it would be assigned to the new marketing entity that was being set=20
up.  Has something changed so that these utility accounts are not going to=20
the purchaser of HPL business?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River=
=20
Sation) to refect a swap from index to fixed price.  Can someone send me the=
=20
original deal so that I can see what needs to be amended?

Feb 01
5,000 a day=20
$6.28 + .199 instead of Index + .199

After months of email negotiations, the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale=20
Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and The City of San Antonio,=20

to assign to the new entity being set up for the non HPL Texas deals that=20
need to remain separate from HPL. =20
