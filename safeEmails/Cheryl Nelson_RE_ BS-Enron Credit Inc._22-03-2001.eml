Sara, I just the message you just left about playing phone tag with Anna at=20
Bear Stearns.  As the lotus notes and the attached correspondence indicates,=
=20
I was proactive today in contacting Anna to follow through since she did not=
=20
return my last call a few days ago.  Since we already have a meeting set up=20
for tomorrow at 10, I guess her message to you must be old (unless she is no=
t=20
the person responding to her email).  I also spoke this week with the=20
attorneys representing the other brokerage firms and resent comments to them=
=20
after they confessed that they had misplaced the previous ones.  Thus, from=20
my perspective, we have been diligent in trying to open the accounts.

I too would like for us to discuss the other tasks that have to be done. =20
However, I cannot meet today to do so at all.  I am troubleshooting several=20
ABSOLUTELY URGENT tasks that have to get done today for ITG and for the CYNE=
T=20
deal.  I am available to meet tomorrow at my earliest convenience.

 As you may or may not know, we had two other "EMERGENCIES" with respect to=20
brokerage accounts having to do with Frost, Cynet and another -- I cannot=20
even remember which.  And, aside from these, we just executed four agreement=
s=20
in the past week.  =20

I want to reassure you that I believe to the best of everyone's ability we=20
are as diligent as possible in getting these things done.   I will contact=20
Keegan to set up a meeting as soon as possible tomorrow to talk about Enron=20
Credit Inc.
