I am going to start periodically attending the SE power origination weekly m=
eetings.  Mike attends the Midwest origination meetings and I have gotten ve=
ry positive feedback from the originators.  I'll find out what the Services =
group and Northeast origination has in the form of regular meetings.  Are th=
ere any that we should attend for EES?  Let me know if I should ask them.
