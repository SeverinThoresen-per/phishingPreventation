Let me first apologize for this being so late.  I had to consult with Legal.=
  Below are the answers to the questions asked last week in Ed's staff meeti=
ng:

1.  Will the employees receive a sheet of paper telling them how much they w=
ill get?  At the time payouts are made employees should receive some sort of=
 confirmation of what $ amount is paid and what $ amount is deferred.  The e=
xact method of this communication is being worked out currently.  Amounts pa=
id and confirmed will most likely be posted for employee reference on ehronl=
ine similar to our benefit programs.
2.  What is going on with the SEC?  With relation to the KERP program, the S=
EC had several questions they posed to Dan Leff, Steve Cooper and Robert Jon=
es.  Their questions were answered efficiently, and as you all now know the =
KERP plan has been approved by the courts.
3.  Who is on the Management Committee?  At this time the Management Committ=
ee consists of the below listed:
Stephen Cooper*
Jeffrey McMahon*
Ray Bowen*
Stan Horton*
Jim Hughes*
Mike McConnell*
Scott Josey
Dan Leff*
Tim Detmering
Jeff Donahue
Mitch Taylor
Dick Lydecker
Cindy Olson
Mark Palmer
Greg Piper
Jordan Mintz
Rob Walls*
*Denotes Executive Management Committee
4.  Is the $1.85M quarterly floor payment in the LIP guaranteed?  Yes.
5.  Are the LIP quarterly floor payments forward or backward?  The LIP floor=
 payments are quarterly payments that are off-settable to the milestone paym=
ents.  In other words, the LIP floor payments are paid on a draw in advance =
of us meeting the milestones.  The milestone payment would be off-set by any=
 payment made under the quarterly floor requirement.

I hope this address your questions adequately.

Thanks-
