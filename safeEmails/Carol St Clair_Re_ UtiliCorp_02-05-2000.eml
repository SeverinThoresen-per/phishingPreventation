Hello Carol,

I am ok with deleting this section entirely from the contract.  We have=20
margin rights and the threshold is relatively low given the size and quality=
=20
of this credit.

Thanks
Brant

There is one issue that is left to resolve.  In the CSA, we define=20
independent amount as any amount specified for a party in any Confirmation o=
r=20
if no amount is specified, 0.  They wnat to either delete this entirely or=20
add language requiring some type of notice to the credit dept. of the party=20
that has to put up the independent amount before it becomes effective.  What=
=20
do you want to do?
