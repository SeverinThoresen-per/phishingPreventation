To forecast Entex:

We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low=20
and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day,=20
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database=20
is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provide=
s=20
an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, th=
e=20
sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 3=
8=20
to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is=20
then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is=20
calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply=20
information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate. =20
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;=
 =20
Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex=20
takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating=20
volumes each day), etc.

Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor t=
o=20
estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days=
=20
that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been=20
caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates=20
more in line.

Let me know if you have any questions.
