Gentlemen -

Dabhol events over the last week to 10 days have not been encouraging:

We made claim against the GOI Guarantee for the December invoice.  Under the=
=20
terms of the GOI Guarantee, the GOI has 30 days (of which about 23 are left)=
=20
to make payment.  The December invoice is now about 50 days overdue.

The issuer of MSEB's letter of credit has stated publicly that it will not=20
renew MSEB's letter of credit posted under the PPA.

We are preparing an arbitration against MSEB based on MSEB's=20
"mis-declaration" claim of offset against the January invoice.  The "meet an=
d=20
discuss" is scheduled to take place this Friday.  An arbitration proceeding=20
could then be filed in early April on this issue.  Linklaters is preparing=20
the arbitration submission.

We believe that 5 public interest suits have recently been filed in Nagpur=20
(another city in Maharashtra).  It is possible that one of the suits has=20
already been "admitted" by the judge or judges without Dabhol Power Company'=
s=20
participation in the admission evaluation (which is apparently quite=20
unusual).  We continue to investigate the nature of these suits.  We are not=
=20
entitled, as a matter of right, to see the suits until we have been served=20
and have designated our counsel.

The project continues to be assaulted on a number of regulatory fronts:

-   We have been ordered to cease testing on Phase II of the plant.  The=20
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) contends that we do not have the=20
proper permit to test (although this position is different than the position=
=20
MPCB ultimately took on Phase I).

-  The Chief Minister in Maharashtra has stated publicly that he has directe=
d=20
the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to scour the plant and find a reason=
=20
to shut the plant down for environmental deviations.  Local officials (who=20
were more balanced based on long-standing relationships with DPC) are=20
apparently being replaced by officials who will likely be quite zealous.

-  A local administrator has ruled that some of our quarry leases are not=20
valid.  We will appeal this ruling but DPC still needs to quarry until late=20
this year.  The local administrator's ruling may further encourage other=20
persons to contest the validity of other leases (if only to seek a second=20
"windfall" payment for the same land).
