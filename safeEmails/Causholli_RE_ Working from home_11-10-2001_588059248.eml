Dave,

I am fine. I thought Karen told you about me working from home today. I am r=
eading the tissue book that I just received from Esko Uutella Consulting in =
Germany.

I am also working on Abitibi's mills and send it to you by email. I asked Gr=
eg Bruch about the mills but he did not know the information as much in deta=
il as we had it.

Thanks,
Monika
