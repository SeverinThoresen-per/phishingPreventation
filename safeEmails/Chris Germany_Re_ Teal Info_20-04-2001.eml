I am so glad you are going.  Here is the scoop.  Think about your flights
and let me know.  If you would rather drive w/ Berk and I and another guy
that works here, you are welcome!!!
But, you know you will never catch as many fish as Judy.  She is just
amazing.  No one can touch her!


May 2-4 -       Fly to the lodge (Corpus) on Wednesday afternoon or evening
