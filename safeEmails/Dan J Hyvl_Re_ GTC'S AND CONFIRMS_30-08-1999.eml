Re 1. I don't believe that the traders on 35 are appropriately covered based=
=20
on what Dan has told me.  Is that a concern?  If so, it is possible to=20
manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time.

Re 3.  I understand what Mary is saying, but in these cases that I'm=20
referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The=20
meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are=20
still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into th=
e=20
system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client=20
services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer. =20
But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because clien=
t=20
services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in=20
violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on th=
e=20
meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business=20
decission though.

I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still=20
flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be=20
to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of=
=20
the recorded line.

Julie,=20

In response to your concerns below:

1.  The traders on 35 are currently attempting to install a recorded line to=
=20
be used when negotiating.

2.  The difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that Unify=20
will not prevent the payment from going out the door.  I do not believe Unif=
y=20
Settlements drafts based on contract status, it drafts on any Sitara deal=20
that replicated down, and Sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract. =20

3.  We have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and=
=20
enhancing Unify to hold payment as long as there was VP approval to hold=20
payment, but Mary Cook said that this process would be in violation of the=20
UCC based on the fact that we would partially perform (by accepting the gas=20
via the nom/scheduling process).  With this partial performance, withholding=
=20
the payment would not be appropriate under the law. =20

Please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments.

Thank you,=20
Melissa

While going through our confirmation process, there was some concern raised=20
on deals that we are not confirming.  I'm sure you are aware of the concern=20
that George W. had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producer=
s=20
when they were trying to get a firm contract signed.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl=20
today and I wanted to relay to you his thoughts.

His first concern was if the Asset Traders were trading on a recorded phone=20
lines.  Apparently the GTC's specify that if there is a dispute with what is=
=20
on the confirmation, the recorded phone call would be the back up.  He said=20
that if these calls are not recorded, then we should not be using the GTC's.=
 =20
In the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is=20
signed (example: a ticket was submitted today to start back in June), then w=
e=20
should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued an=
d=20
tracked.  His decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a=20
contract is marked unexecuted, Unify would not make payment.  If that is not=
=20
the case, we could still put the contract and deal in the systems, and have =
a=20
VP signed off that payment would not go out the door.

If deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line, Dan said that we would=20
need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door.  Like=20
for example, have the producer sign a one month contract.  Which I'm not sur=
e=20
you would want to do that.  Otherwise, he said that the trades should be sen=
t=20
down to 31 so they will be recorded.

I hope this makes sense.  Please call me, and let me know your thoughts.

Julie
