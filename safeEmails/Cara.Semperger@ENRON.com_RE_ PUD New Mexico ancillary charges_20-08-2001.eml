It seems that PNM is charging an unreasonable amount for losses.  Is there a=
ny way we could address this.

Thanks,
Holden

Guys-

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follow=
s:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 =
per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based=
 on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the=
 market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be h=
earing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring d=
own  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  Thi=
s taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   examp=
le from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not ac=
counting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.
