I need some further clarification.  As I understand it, some, if not all, of=

the meters that reside in Beaumont and South Texas Divisions are included in=

Exhibit C.  Are we saying that the "extend and blend" transaction excluded=20
some volume previously included?  That is inconsistent with the analysis=20

I have asked Arhur Andersen for a copy of the amended Exhibit C so I can=20
fully understand.  Maybe that will help clear my confusion also.

Subject: Exhibit C Delivery Points


Ami,

As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points=20
appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the=20
audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the=20
focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions.  Stated=20
differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General=20
Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division shoul=
d=20
be considered part of the Basket.

Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that=20
the DCQ obligations apply  to "Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast=
=20
Divisions."  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery=20
Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was=
=20
to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan=20
Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this=20
Transaction.

Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76=20
Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the=20
Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the=20
applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.

Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior t=
o=20
December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not=20
seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered=
=20
that the "Texas Coast Division" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is=20
actually the "Gulf Coast Division."  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent=20
for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future=20
clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to=20
discuss these issues with you further.

I hope you find this information useful.  If you have any questions or=20
comments, please do not hesitate to call me or Aaron Roffwarg at (713)=20
221-1117.
