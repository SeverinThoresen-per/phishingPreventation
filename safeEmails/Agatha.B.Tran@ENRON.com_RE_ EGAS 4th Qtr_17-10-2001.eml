Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd=
 CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred =
out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merch=
ant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This doe=
s NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to E=
GAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send y=
ou those numbers when we are done.
