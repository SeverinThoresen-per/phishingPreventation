Hi Richard,=20
I know this is an old question, but someone had asked if the utilities in Ma=
ssachusetts were sending out Environmental Labels to the customers we supply=
 energy to.  I confirmed with all three utilities and this is not the case, =
so we need to be sending those labels out.  John Milton at NSTAR said that t=
hey might be willing to work with us on this and maybe do a mailstuffer for =
us if we provide the labels; his phone number is 781-441-3499.  No one offer=
ed any help at the other utilities.

Alex
