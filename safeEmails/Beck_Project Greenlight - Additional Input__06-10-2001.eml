SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday d=
uring your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today f=
inishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional =
items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in=
 the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting wi=
th Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be ab=
le to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your =
comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee=
 members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or addition=
s to the document before that meeting.=20

I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Mond=
ay - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely =
enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visi=
t.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however. =20
