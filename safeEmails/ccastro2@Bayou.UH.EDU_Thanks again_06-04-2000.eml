Vince and Stinson,

I would like to thank you for helping me trying to find an Internship. I
really appreciate the attention you gave to me.

I am happy to tell you that I found an internship in my area of interest
with MFRGroup.  It is a consulting company that provides management
consulting, advisory, finance, operations management and information
technology services.  I will be helping them to develop a new business
related with e-commerce B-to-B.

=46rom now on, I will be concentrating my efforts in finding a full time
position, because I will graduate at the end of the year.  I do not want to
miss Enron's deadline, and I am still very interested in EnronOnline
business.  Please keep me updated if any opportunity arises.

Thanks again

Carla Di Castro

PS: Vince, I tried to call you today, but it looks like you will be out of
the office until Monday. I just wanted to say thank you.
