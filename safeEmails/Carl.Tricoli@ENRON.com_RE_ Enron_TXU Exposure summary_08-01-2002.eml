TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provide=
d us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial pow=
er and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please pr=
ovide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michel=
le, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled "other" - is this som=
ething from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,7=
51,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to t=
he bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you. =20

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

JDS
