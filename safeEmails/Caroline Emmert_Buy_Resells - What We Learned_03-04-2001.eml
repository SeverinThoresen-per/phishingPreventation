John,

=46rom our research into Avista and others, here is what we have learned abo=
ut=20
using Buy/Resells:

Whether to select "Buy From" or "Sell To" upon deal entry is determined by=20
the ultimate purpose of the BR, as shown here:

Purpose: =20
Pay the Customer (sleeve or other service they have provided to EPMI)

Type is Buy From
Pricing is:  Buy =3D EPMI price
      Sell =3D Customer price

Charge the Customer (services or other, like transmission recapture)

Type is Sell To
Pricing is:  Buy =3D Customer price
      Sell =3D EPMI price

I hope this helps to determine the correct way of entering a buy/resell, and=
=20
will alleviate settlement discrepancies in the future.  If you agree with=20
this, feel free to share it with the real time group. =20
