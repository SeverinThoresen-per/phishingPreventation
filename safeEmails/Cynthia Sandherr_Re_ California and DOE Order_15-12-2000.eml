DOE and FERC just briefed the Hill and confirmed they never issued the Order=
=20
yesterday since Bonneville released a lot more power late yesterday.  The=20
Administration advised that if the situation warrants, they will indeed issu=
e=20
the Order.  This remains a fluid situation with Richardson yesterday=20
announcing his intent to "sign an Order" which his staff had not yet written=
=20
while in the interim BPA acted so as to make his announcement moot.

We will continue to apprise you of the developments including reports of=20
FERC's surprise site inspections.
