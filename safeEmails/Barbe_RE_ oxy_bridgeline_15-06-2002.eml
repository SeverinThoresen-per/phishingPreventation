 a prepay to transact with occidental energy marketing.

Paul Darmitzel called Christy Finelli, our gisb attorney, regarding the gisb=
 agreement that Oxy emailed me.  Christy is out of the office today.  I spok=
e with her on her cell phone.  She said just before we declared bankruptcy s=
he had negotiated a gisb agreement with Oxy.  She's optimistic that they can=
 get a contract in place quickly.  She would like to wait until Monday to wo=
rk on it.  I told her that would be OK.  I am assuming that we are not in a =
position to sell Oxy gas today. =20

If necessary I could attempt to make a sale contingent on credit and a execu=
ted agreement.

If you want me to attempt to sell gas to Oxy today, please let me know as so=
on as possible.

Thanks

Robin
