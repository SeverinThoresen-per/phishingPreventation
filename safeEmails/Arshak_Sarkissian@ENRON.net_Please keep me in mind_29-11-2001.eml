Hi Louise;  I know things are tough in all areas and this is a difficult tim=
e for everyone. I just wanted to let you know that I don't know what my dest=
iny will be around here especially since we are shutting Broadband down and =
I have not received any word if I will be part of the work out team.  If you=
 know of anything that might be fit for me either for the short term or the =
longer, please keep me in mind.

Best regards & good luck,

Arshak.
