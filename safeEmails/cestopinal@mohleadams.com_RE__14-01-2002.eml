After each of your questions is my response.  It's immediately preceded by [=

Connie,

I think we finally decided how much money we want to disclaim for purposes o=
f funding the trust.=20

We will not be diclaiming the house but will try to disclaim two life insura=
nce checks, an ADD through Jimmy's employer, Marsh & McLennan, and held with=
 CNA and the credit card Travel Accidental Death Insurace held through Ameri=
can Express. I will be talking to the Larry Harman about the process of doin=
g this. It will add about 450k to the estate and take the probate assets up =
to about 1.4M or 700k for the trust.
[Connie L. Babbitt]  That sounds good.  There are always complications when =
a personal residence is put in a disclaimer trust, so I believe you are maki=
ng the correct decision there. =20

Is there any deadline or timelines on when the trust must be setup?=20
[Connie L. Babbitt]  No, but the disclaimer must be filed with the probate c=
ourt by June 11, 2002.=20

Is there a form to send to the IRS to request a tax ID for the trust?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Yes, an SS-4 Form.  We can prepare one for your mother'=
s signature.=20

My mom wants to know if we need to meet with you or when?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  I would like to meet with her.  I think she will be mor=
e comfortable if she's had a chance to meet me personally, although it's cer=
tainly not required.  I visit many of my clients at their home, so I could m=
eet at her house if that would be more convenient for her.  She may prefer a=
 meeting fairly soon to answer any general questions she may have about the =
estate, trust funding, and distributions of assets.  If our firm will be pre=
paring the 2001 income tax return, I would also need to meet with her to obt=
ain all the 1099s, W-2s, etc for the 2001 return.  A meeting around the end =
of January, beginning of February would probably be good timing for that.

When will we find out what those new regulations will really mean for our es=
tate income taxes?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Once I see the 2001 1099s, W-2s, etc and get a better g=
rip on all the income sources, we ought to be able to zero in better on the =
issues.  At first blush, I would anticipate very little tax liability for 20=
01.  I'm hoping the IRS will be issuing further guidance to address more det=
ails, e.g. spousal income, etc, over the next few weeks.  I'm sorry I can't =
give you a more definitive answer on this one.

Thanks,

=20

Geof
