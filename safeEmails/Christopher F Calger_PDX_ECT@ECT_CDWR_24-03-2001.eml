Louise,

I spoke with Mark.  I believe he is getting a little more comfortable.  He i=
s now focused appropriately on the likelihood of the bonds getting issued.  =
He is going to call around to some law firms and I will talk to some Bankers=
, just to get some other opinions.  I will have a short presentation for the=
 meeting.

Cheers,

Chris
