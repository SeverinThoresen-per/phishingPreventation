I have created the following new Product Types in the Data Manager:

AUS CDD Swap
AUS HDD Swap
JPN CDD Swap
JPN HDD Swap

These are exactly the same as the existing AUS and JPN Weather Swap Product=20
Types which you have previously approved with the exception that they have=20
been created with the trading entity as Enron North America and will be=20
denominated in USD. The intention is to give the seperate Weather desks the=20
ability to transact weather around the clock. The transactions will be=20
denominated in the domicile currency, thereby avoiding dual taxation=20
consequences.

Please go into the DataManager and offer your respective approval.

Dale
