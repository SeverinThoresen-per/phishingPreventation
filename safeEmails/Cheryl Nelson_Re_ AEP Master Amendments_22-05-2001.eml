Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now. =20
Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not=20
need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will=20
change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be=20
the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it=20
possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We=20
want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on=20
both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather=
=20
than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter
