Thanks for the clarification, Larry.  I don't think we need to meet to discu=
ss this issue.  I guess that I just misunderstood your initial message to im=
ply that certain documents were still unaccessible to customers.  I'm satisf=
ied.

A customer can access all of NNG accounting documents( all invoices and thei=
r supporting documents).  However, due to tighter security coding in Busines=
s Objects compare to Actuate, reports are now only viewable by one party, in=
stead of two parties. For example, at a poi where there is an agent and an o=
perator, the agent is only able to view the Measurement Info, Daily Volume A=
llocation and Allocation statements.   IT is researching a fix to a situatio=
n like this.

If you still would like to meet with me to explain further, give a demo (or =
have  lunch meeting with just the three of us!), let me know.

Thanks=20

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Document=
s are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalanc=
e invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view b=
oth the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also vi=
ew the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalan=
ce, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement I=
nformation) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to A=
ctuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps =
and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for insta=
nce, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will =
also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas tha=
t are needed.

See me if you have questions.=20
