Group,
Virginia is exactly correct on this point.  MAKE IT A HABIT!  The majority o=
f inadvertancy that we have contributed to (and there hasn't been that much)=
 has been a result of confusion on times and duration of trades. =20
Thanks,
Bill

Dear Real Timers,

As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the impor=
tance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make deals.  It=
 is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours that you are =
trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at the end=
 of your trade!! :) please...

There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neithe=
r trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm =
relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades.

Please see or e-mail me with any questions.

Thanks.

Virginia
