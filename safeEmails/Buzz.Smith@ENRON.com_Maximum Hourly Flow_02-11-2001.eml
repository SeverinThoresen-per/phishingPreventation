To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum=
 Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cen=
t.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6%=
 is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 =3D 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 =3D 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 100=
0 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affe=
ct the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any l=
ateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 =3D 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ b=
y 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.
