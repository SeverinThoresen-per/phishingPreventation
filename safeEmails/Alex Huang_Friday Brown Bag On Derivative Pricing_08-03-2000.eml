Dear everyone,=20

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working=20
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all=20
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find=20
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,=20
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep=20
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let=
=20
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of=20
this group.=20

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag=20
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. =20
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20
technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that we=
 do=20
not have to reinvent the wheels. =20

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will=
=20
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from=20
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing,=
=20
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything=20
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have=20
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20
presentation style.  It could be =20
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style=20
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon the=
=20
responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin or=
=20
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and=20
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to=20
hear your presentation.=20

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give =
a=20
talk or just sit in.=20
