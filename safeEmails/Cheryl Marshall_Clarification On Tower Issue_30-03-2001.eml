I spoke with Jason Griffith with AEP this evening, and I want to clarify my=20
previous e-mail message.  The operation/business issues that we have at the=20
Gilmer tower are under control.  The tower has problems with its lighting=20
system, and it does not have its FAA license posted.  As lessee, HPL did not=
=20
want to be exposed to the potential fines that the FAA/FCC could levy agains=
t=20
the tower owner. =20

This tower supports one person, and is not a part of our critical data path.=
 =20
My concern and reason for sending the prior e-mail revolved around the FCC=20
licenses associated with the HPL owned equipment on this tower.  My knowledg=
e=20
about FCC licenses is minimal, and I wanted to ensure that removing the=20
equipment from this tower would not jeopardize the transfer of the licences=20
from Enron to AEP.  It is my understanding that the current operational=20
situation at the Gilmer tower will not effect the transfer of the licences=20
that are specific to this tower.  Please let me know if this is not the=20
case.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Marshall
