Attached is 4th part.  This is the final part.

By receipt of this transmission, you are now in possession of all the electo=

One note of clarification -- I have provided the electronic/pdf version of t=
he Florida Power & Light Company agreement.  However, at the time the binder=
 was delivered this agreement had not come my way; therefore, it is not incl=
uded in the current binder is scheduled to be included a supplemental binder=

Please advise if I may be of further assistance.
