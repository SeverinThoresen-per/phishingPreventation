Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financia=
l officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterd=
ay and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investo=
r confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough =
understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the is=
sues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.=
 =20

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He jo=
ined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief finan=
cial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., J=
eff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  I=
n 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Work=
s.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share pr=
ice.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing =
Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution=
 involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals =
of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as=
 we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of yo=
ur continued hard work.
