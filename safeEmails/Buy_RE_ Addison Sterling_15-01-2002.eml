Rick --

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM. =
 She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached=
 a link to the hospital's website that has her picture (she is much cuter in=
 person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chica=
go Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.
