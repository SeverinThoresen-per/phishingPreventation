Guess Who???  Its back on my desk.  How do you feel about doing a manual=20
invoice?  That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point.

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take=
=20
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe=20
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he=20
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice=20
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year. =20

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcas=
t=20
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the=20
invoice will be faxed over to him.


Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Darla
