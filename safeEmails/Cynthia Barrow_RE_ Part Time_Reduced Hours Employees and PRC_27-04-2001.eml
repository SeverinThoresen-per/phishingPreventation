I agree with Melissa and am in favor of a separate process. =20

PT/RH employees need to be rated on a relevant scale.  A PT employee's job=20
scope "the place the initial bar is set" is not relevant to a FT employee. =20

Facilitation and Ground rules are great but as we know they change as the=20
circumstances of a meeting change.  Consistency here has not been our=20
strength.

I also agree that the PT/RH is an important talent pool.  If we don't give=20
these folks a chance at equal rating we stand to lose the ability to offer=20
this as a legitimate employee class.

In addition, we need to consider the message sent to FT employees.  Will the=
y=20
preceive the process as fair.

Thanks

In my opinion, a part time person who may add value in the time that they ar=

able to work will invariably get "creamed" in the prc, and that might impact=

our ability to tap into this talent pool (assuming we want to).  I agree tha=

a part time person can't possibly add as much value (in most cases) as a ful=

feedback without a ranking (like the non-exempts).

All,=20

As you know I have been tasked with soliciting your views and suggestions on=

PT/RH employees and PRC.  From my personal point of view I don't think we=20
should have a separate process for PT/RH employees.  I think that we should=20
cover the issue in facilitator training and have a statement in the ground=20
rules defining who is rated in PRC meetings, i.e. "all active exempt=20
employees hired after January 1, 2001  who have full time, part time or=20
reduced hours are rated in PRC."  Likewise, the new feature to provide=20
employee accomplishments in the PRC meeting may help to  balance the=20
committee's perspective on PT/RH employees.  Your thoughts?
