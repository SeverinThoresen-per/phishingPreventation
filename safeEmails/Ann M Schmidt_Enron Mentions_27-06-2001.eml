BOMBAY, India -- A planned summit of India's and Pakistan's top leaders is=20
giving new momentum to a $5 billion international gas-pipeline plan that was=
=20
once dismissed as a pipe dream. U.S. companies may be left out, though,=20
because the gas would originate in Iran.=20
The decades-old pipeline idea, from gas-rich Iran east through Pakistan and=20
into gas-hungry India, has always floundered on India's reluctance to deal=20
with Pakistan. Since gaining independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have=20
fought three wars and a bloody border skirmish two years ago that derailed=20
efforts to establish some economic cooperation. On July 14, Pakistani Gen.=20
Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup and recently named himself=
=20
president, is scheduled to arrive in Agra, India, for his first summit=20
meeting with India Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Pakistan officials have told reporters they expect the pipeline to be=20
discussed. India's foreign ministry won't confirm that, but Mr. Vajpayee gav=
e=20
a green light to pipeline discussions during a recent trip to Tehran,=20
industry officials said. India has previously limited itself to exploring=20
undersea pipelines that avoid Pakistan. After the trip, Iran promptly asked=20
Australia's BHP Petroleum to launch a feasibility study on a land route.=20
"There have been some studies before, but I think this is the most official,=

an Iranian official said.=20
Pipeline talks could present a quandary for the Bush administration.=20
Washington has encouraged India and Pakistan to reduce tensions on the=20

Iran. U.S. oil companies are lobbying hard for the administration to let=20
sanctions on Iran expire this year instead of renewing them for two years.=20
Though the 1,500-mile pipeline remains a long shot, it may be one of the few=
=20
topics India and Pakistan can discuss without fear of political backlash at=20
home. Neither country is likely to budge from their hardened positions on th=

$600 million a year. India could get relief from a gas deficit that has=20
fertilizer plants running on reduced fuel and power plants running on=20
more-expensive naphtha.=20
Also, India's biggest private company appears to be shifting the balance in=20
favor of an Iran pipeline. Reliance Industries Ltd., a Bombay-based polyeste=
r=20
and petroleum company that is gearing up to challenge government monopolies=20
in telecommunications and gas supply, recently launched a $10 million study=20
on importation of liquefied gas from Iran to India by ship, in partnership=20
with BP Inc. and National Iranian Oil Co. But industry officials familiar=20
with Reliance's plans said the company is expressing interest in the pipelin=

energy source for Reliance's huge industrial complex in India's northwestern=

Reliance wouldn't comment on its gas-supply plans. If the company does inser=
t=20
itself as a potential buyer of the pipeline gas, a deal could become easier=20
to negotiate than if India's state-owned gas company were the buyer.=20
Still, "What's missing really at this moment is someone who would broker an=20
arrangement," says Hugh McDermott, a principal of consulting firm Nexant Inc=

who heads a U.S.-funded project promoting energy cooperation among South=20

The less India and Pakistan are willing to trust each other, the bigger role=

the gas industry is for Iran to agree on delivery all the way to the Indian=20
border, paying Pakistan's transit fees and guaranteeing safe passage through=
=20
Pakistan. Iran and Pakistan have warmed their previously frosty relations=20
recently, but whether Iran -- or even Pakistan itself -- could really=20

province deregulated electricity at the start of the year.=20
Enron Canada Corp., the Canadian unit of Houston-based Enron, unveiled Enron=
=20
Direct Canada Corp., a new unit that will sell electricity and natural gas=20
directly to commercial and light industrial businesses in Alberta. The=20
company will go head to head with Alberta's established major utility=20
retailers -- mainly Enmax Corp. of Calgary and Epcor Utilities Inc. of=20
Edmonton -- in the battle for the roughly 120,000 business customers in the=20
province's deregulated natural gas and electricity markets.
"Obviously, we'd like to gain market share and be a significant competitor i=

Enron's announcement prompted speculation that the company might be=20

which feature a base of about one million commercial and residential=20
customers. Mr. Milnthorp wouldn't say whether Enron has talked with Atco=20
about buying the assets.=20
But Mr. Fruehauf said it "wouldn't surprise" him if Enron was interested.=20
Enron has been providing retail power to commercial customers since 1993,=20

Dabhol: Lessons for FDI
Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar

06/27/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

IT WILL be hard for foreign investors to look seriously at India until this=20
(Dabhol) dispute is resolved in a satisfactory way. So said Alan Larson, US=20
Under-secretary of State for business and agriculture, at the meeting of the=
=20
Indo-US Business Council last week.=20
Many other observers of the foreign investment scene, including Indian=20
diplomats in Washington, say the same.
Some Indians take comfort in the fact that neither Moodys nor Standard and=20
Poors have downgraded India as a credit risk. But these rating agencies rate=
=20
the safety of not FDI but of sovereign Indian paper.=20
Now, the government of India is clearly able and willing to service all its=20
foreign debt. Its forex reserves stand at a record $43 billion, and its debt=
=20
service ratio is down from a peak of 33 per cent to just 15 per cent or so.=20
In the case of Dabhol, the central government has reaffirmed that it will=20
honour its counter-guarantee. The entity that is both unwilling and unable t=
o=20
pay is the Maharashtra state government.=20
The Maharashtra chief minister has made it clear that he does not believe in=
=20
enforcement of contracts: he believes a politician has the right to renege o=
n=20
contracts simply on the ground that the price looks too high. Such wilful=20
default is far worse in the eye of the foreign investor than mere bankruptcy=
=2E=20
Maybe Dabhol will be renegotiated satisfactorily and the dust will settle.=20
Meanwhile, it is essential to distil lessons from Dabhol for FDI.=20
One lesson is that a foreign investor who negotiates a deal that yields a=20
fabulous price from his viewpoint but bankrupts the customer is not a=20
fabulous deal at all but a bad one that invites political risk on top of=20
commercial risk.=20
The second and more important lesson is that state governments in India are=20
bankrupt but individuals and corporations are solvent. Enron made the seriou=
s=20
error of thinking it was easier to collect dues from a state government than=
=20
individual consumers.=20
Other foreign investors in telecom, ports, banking and roads are faring=20
better because their bills are paid by individuals and corporations.=20
Not long ago, Maharashtra was regarded as one of the best administered and=20
most solvent states. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board used to generat=
e=20
healthy profits in excess of Rs 100 crore per year.=20
The states fiscal deterioration in the last five years has not received the=20
attention it deserves. All states were hard hit by the Pay Commission award,=
=20
and most analysts (including me) blithely assumed that `good states like=20
Maharashtra would bounce back.=20
That optimism has turned out to be misplaced. Except for Gujarat, Tamil Nadu=
=20
and possibly one or two others, state governments today seem unable to meet=20
their commitments.=20
Worse, they regard this state of affairs as somewhat unfortunate but=20
nevertheless a political necessity.=20
They are not inclined to make the wrenching changes needed reducing non-meri=
t=20
subsidies and surplus staff, while increasing the collection of taxes and=20
user charges.=20
The quality of public services keeps deteriorating, which is why ruling=20
parties keep losing elections. What election pundits call the anti-incumbenc=
y=20
factor is simply unrepentant non-performance.=20
This has been institutionalised since every outgoing regime believes that th=
e=20
other side will fail to perform too, letting it return to power unreformed.=20
For many decades of planned development, the private sector was perceived to=
=20
have little money while governments were perceived to have very deep pockets=
=2E=20
The very opposite is true today. State governments are bust, and cannot=20
deliver even basic services like primary education and health.=20
Meanwhile, the private sector is able to take up the biggest projects ever.=20
Reliance has just built the biggest oil refinery in the world with no=20
government assistance at all. Individuals today shell out Rs 20 lakh or more=
=20
for luxury cars, but governments departments cannot afford even Ambassador=20
cars.=20
So, conventional wisdom has been turned on its head. Today, the central=20
government remains the most creditworthy of all entities.=20
But, clearly, individuals and companies, warts and all, are more capable of=20
paying their dues than all but a few state governments.=20
What implications does this have for FDI? Any foreign investor must carefull=
y=20
survey potential customers first.=20
If the main or only buyer is a state government and this is the case for=20
power projects they should see this as a red flag.=20
Enron is not the only power producer that cannot collect. The NTPC cannot=20
collect in full from Kerala for power from Kayamkulam, and Andhra Pradesh to=
o=20
is in arrears of payment for private power.=20
In all, state governments have run up arrears of Rs 40,000 crore to public=20
sector suppliers alone.=20
If states cannot pay Coal India, Bharat Heavy Electricals or the NTPC for=20
supplies, why should foreign investors except any better treatment? When=20
state governments refuse to honour even bank guarantees, can they be expecte=
d=20
to honour escrow commitments?=20
However, default does not plague other investments where the customers are=20
corporations or even small individuals.=20
FDI in ports is working, because port charges are payable by shipping=20
companies, not state governments. FDI in telecom is working because bills ar=
e=20
paid mainly by companies and individuals.=20
Toll roads are working too, because the tolls are paid by individual=20
motorists and truck drivers.=20
Finally, the central government remains solvent. So FDI in Railway equipment=
=20
or defence equipment looks safe enough.=20
The problem lies not with India as a whole, but with state governments in=20
particular.=20
So the real lesson for foreign investors is beware of any projects where=20
state governments are the sole or even important buyers.=20
Assume that a political culture of non-payment is spreading where state=20
governments regard the presentation of unpaid bills as an irritant rather=20
than a badge of shame.=20
Finally, do not confuse the bankruptcy of state governments with the=20
bankruptcy of India or individual Indians.

Europe Weighs Standard Gas-Trading Contract

LONDON -- Opening up Europe's gas market is slowly getting underway.=20
One crucial element is lacking -- a standardized short-term trading contract=
=20
that will help large customers to pick and choose the best offer in the=20
market, rather than remain shackled to a traditional long-term supplier.
Energy company representatives will gather in Amsterdam today to thrash out=20
such a contract.=20
"Due to the development of gas markets in Europe, especially in Germany, the=
=20
time is ripe for creating a standard European contract," said Joerg Spicker,=
=20
a spokesman for the European Federation of Energy Traders. Mr. Spicker is=20
managing director of the German subsidiary of Aquila Energy, a Utilicorp=20
United Inc. unit.=20
EFET members will create a "template" that could be used in all the trading=20
hubs around Europe, which are emerging as delivery locations for gas sold on=
=20
a short-term basis, Mr. Spicker said. An attachment to the standard contract=
=20
would specify which hub will be used for physical delivery of the gas.=20
"One hurdle to liquidity (in these hubs) is the lack of a standard contract,=
"=20
Steve Asplin, director for Benelux operations at energy firm Enron Corp.=20
said, adding that he sees the EFET initiative as a positive step forward.=20
The standard contract is likely to be in euros per gigajoules and will enabl=
e=20
counterparties in the trade to choose which domestic law -- German, Dutch or=
=20
English -- should apply to the contract.=20
By creating such a contract, EFET aims to replicate in the gas sector the=20

h=20
were launched in 1999 and 2000 and are now widely used for the wholesaletrad=
e=20
of electricity on the continent.=20
The standardization of contract terms is deemed essential for development of=
=20
spot markets in mainland Europe, following the blueprint set by the U.K.=20
since the 1980s and in Belgium since 1999.=20
In addition, the EFET initiative comes just one week ahead of another=20

Ah, the 1990s: Sport-utilities ruled the roads. Computers, printers and othe=
r=20
office gadgets invaded homes. Energy to feed them was cheap and plentiful.=20
Conservation fell casualty to Americans' increasingly energy-dependent=20
lifestyles.
But indulgence came at a price: As consumers have discovered via soaring=20
gasoline prices and winter heating bills, payback time has arrived. And=20
deregulation of the electricity industry could lead to similar sticker shock=
=20
in coming years.=20
Now, New Power Co., a competitive electricity supplier based in Purchase,=20
N.Y., is giving consumers a way to prepare for that day. In Philadelphia and=
=20
Houston, it has begun testing an electronic gizmo that lets the utility=20
control home heating and cooling systems, plus some lights and appliances,=20
via the Internet.=20
Postal worker Bill Dobbins, who lives near the Franklin Mills Mall, is among=
=20
the 300 Philadelphia-area volunteers trying out the high-tech devices.=20
One, a remote temperature control, lets New Power adjust Dobbins' thermostat=
=20
via signals sent over the Internet by two to six degrees, so that his heatin=
g=20
and cooling system conserve power.=20
Dobbins said he joined the experiment because he's "interested in that type=20
of thing." Plus, "there's the monetary reward."=20
New Power is paying volunteers $25 to $75 to participate in the program=20
through September.=20
For New Power, which is backed by Enron Corp. of Houston, the money is a=20
pittance compared with the juicy customer data the test program should=20
reveal.=20
"What we're really interested in is consumer behavior," said Tim Vail, New=20
Power's vice president of energy technology solutions. "How does the consume=
r=20
use [the new system]? Do they use it?"=20
New Power and other electricity providers think the setup can save them big=20
bucks when supply on the electric grid is tight. Vail said the company is=20
examining how to share some of those savings with customers when and if the=20
program is delivered to a wider audience in coming years.=20
The company has divided this summer's test into three parts. The first uses=20
an automated electricity meter, which will keep tabs on a household's daily=20
energy use and help New Power understand typical consumption patterns.=20
The second part is a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, like the on=
e=20
installed in Dobbins' home. It commandeers a consumer's thermostat and=20
adjusts it two to six degrees as directed by New Power. The consumer can=20
override the automatic commands.=20
"You can't give them a widget and ask them while they're in the middle of a=20
dinner party to sweat," said Lou Budike, president of Powerweb Technologies,=
=20
an energy software company in Media that is negotiating with New Power to=20
provide more-detailed usage information to consumers online.=20
Part three of the test lets consumers remotely change their thermostats or=20
switch lights on and off using any Internet device -- a trick, the company=20
says, that could come in handy for discouraging burglars and for conserving=20
power while away on vacation.=20
The centerpiece of New Power's experiment -- giving a utility the ability to=
=20
control customer devices when needed -- is actually a twist on an old theme=20
in the electricity business: Get enough large customers off the power grid=20
when demand is highest, and you greatly reduce the risk of blackouts.=20
Power on the wholesale market is also most expensive at times of day when=20
demand is highest. So getting big users off the system can save money for th=
e=20
power company.=20
In New Power's experiment, a "big user" is actually a bunch of small=20
customers who have agreed to let New Power automatically adjust their=20
thermostats based on conditions in the regional energy market.=20
New Power calls the plan "joint energy management."=20
It remains to be seen, though, whether companies such as New Power can corra=
l=20
enough small customers in this manner to turn a profit.=20
Even with small business customers, "the margin on that size of account is=20
not tremendous," said Jean-Louis Poirier, an energy analyst with PA=20
Consulting Group in Washington.=20
"The residential market is very difficult," Poirier said, because the cost t=
o=20
sign on a residential customer can range from $200 to $700.=20
Still, he said these "demand-side management" programs have great potential=20
for savings.=20
"In the industrial and commercial market, many times you can save 15 to 20=20
percent with both changes in customer behavior and capital investment,"=20
Poirier said.=20
Under state law, retail prices for electricity in Pennsylvania are capped fo=
r=20
several years. For Peco Energy Co.'s customers, the cap lasts through 2006=20
for transmission and distribution charges and through 2010 for generation=20
charges.=20
After this safe harbor for consumers expires, utilities can pass along more=20
costs to their customers.=20
In a deregulated environment, this could mean alarming price increases if=20
consumer demand cannot be quickly reconciled with supply.=20
That, in simple terms, explains California's electricity crisis of the past=20
several months: Retail customers had no incentive to respond to the turmoil=20
in wholesale power markets until it was too late.=20
But generally speaking, customers on alternative plans that adjust rates=20
based on demand or time of day can receive big discounts or rebates over=20
plain vanilla rates -- if they use electricity at the right time.=20
For instance, consumers willing to dry clothes late in the evening instead o=
f=20
during peak electricity use hours could pay less for the electricity they=20
use. Conversely, they could wind up paying more by running the dryer during=20
peak times.=20
It's an idea regulators want to see more of.=20
The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission this year ordered all utilities=20
serving the state to implement programs that deal with the customer, or=20
demand, side of the energy equation.=20
While Peco has a time-of-use rate available for residential and other=20
customer classes, spokesman Michael Wood said it is not heavily marketed.=20
The company is, however, starting its own pilot program this month with 50=20
Delaware County customers, offering a "smart thermostat" similar to New=20
Power's. Peco will offer a discount to customers who let it raise their=20
thermostats two to four degrees for up to four hours at a time, when demand=20
for electricity is high.=20
"Without that, there's no strong incentive for consumers to conserve, when=20
they don't see the benefit on a real-time basis," Wood said.=20
Vail said New Power hopes to offer homeowners throughout its territory a=20

Coal Cos Take Cautious View Of Nymex Coal Futures
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The July 12 debut of a long-awaited coal futures=20
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange has the potential to increase=20
the liquidity of the spot market for the commodity and the volatility of coa=
l=20
prices.=20
However, some coal suppliers are cautious not to overestimate the impact the=
=20
event will have on the industry.
Still, analysts say the futures contract could attract more investor interes=
t=20
to coal company stocks because it may increase the amount of information=20
investors have about the direction of coal prices.=20
Currently, about 20% of the nation's coal is sold in the over-the-counter=20
spot market, which includes trading exchanges run by Enron Corp. (ENE),=20
Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Energy Corp. (ILA). While an over-the-counter=
=20
market existed for decades, it has gotten much more volatile in recent years=
=20
as supplies of coal tightened.=20
Some company officials and industry analysts believe the coal market has=20
never been in a better position for the introduction of a Nymex contract tha=
n=20
it is now because the current supply-demand balance is much more healthy for=
=20
the industry.=20
Years of a supply glut, and the low prices that followed, forced many coal=20
companies to shut down high-cost mines. Also, industry consolidation made th=
e=20
surviving companies more efficient.=20
Over the past year, high natural gas prices and short supplies of electricit=
y=20
in some regions further strengthened industry trends by increasing the deman=
d=20
for coal from power producers, which can use coal to generate electricity.=20
Despite these favorable industry trends, vast differences in the properties=20
of coal will make it more difficult to trade than many other commodities,=20
analysts said. Types of coal are typically separated by region - for example=
,=20
East, West and Appalachian. The amount of sulfur, ash, moisture and volatile=
=20
matter in the coals also has an impact on how the fuel is priced.=20
"Coal is not a homogenous product by any means," said Michael Dudas, an=20
analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.=20
Also complicating the trading of coal contracts is the lack of flexibility=20
about where coal can be physically moved, said David Khani, an analyst at=20
Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. "It will take an industry behind the scenes t=
o=20
(make it work)," he said.=20
Another constraint is the industry's practice of signing long-term supply=20
contracts, which can sometimes stretch more than a decade. Some fear that if=
=20
too much supply remains locked into contracts, it will stall the building of=
=20
liquidity in the futures market.=20
In recent years, however, buyers have opted more often for supply contracts=20
that average three to five years in length. Often, these agreements include=20
options that allow the deals to be renegotiated if there is a dramatic chang=
e=20
in prices.=20
In order for coal to trade successfully, it will need to clear these hurdles=
=2E=20
Dudas warned that not every contract the Nymex launches succeeds, and said h=
e=20
will be among those waiting to see how things develop.=20
"I'm not sure how much liquidity we might see in the start," he said.=20
Peter Ward, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc., also raised concerns about=20
liquidity. He said his initial perception is that it will be tough to trade =
a=20
coal contract because so little coal currently is traded in the spot market.=
=20
Others were more optimistic.=20
It may take a while to take off, said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst=20
Wayne Atwell, but Nymex trading should make for a deeper market.=20
Khani said the contract is important for the industry because the equity=20
market needs to see easily where coal prices are trading.=20
"The price of coal is somewhat of an enigma to a lot of people," he said.=20
"(Investors) are making the judgment that coal prices fall with oil and gas=20
prices, but coal prices are holding very firm," he said. Coal Suppliers See=20
Futures As New Industry Tool=20

Some coal suppliers are less doubtful about the contract's ability to be=20
successful. However, they expect it will take some time before there is=20
enough interest to affect their earnings significantly.=20
Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) views the Nymex contract as a tool that it can use to=20
hedge its exposure in the market, said Henry Besten, vice president of=20
strategic marketing.=20
Although Besten expects the exposure on Nymex will increase the liquidity of=
=20
the current spot market for coal, he also said it is a natural extension of=20
the trading activity that already exists.=20
Besten also expects the exposure on Nymex will introduce financial players=20
into the market, which may increase the volatility of coal prices.=20
Although Arch will take advantage of trading opportunities to try to increas=
e=20
its profits, the St. Louis company doesn't think of trading as a separate=20
revenue stream.=20
The event may ultimately be more significant for Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU),=
=20
which is a more active trader of coal.=20
About 3% of Peabody's revenue, and roughly 3% to 5% of its earnings, come=20
from its trading activities, said Vic Svec, a company spokesman. He added=20
that Peabody, the largest private-sector coal company in the world, doesn't=20
provide specific segment detail.=20
According to Svec, the St. Louis company began expanding its coal-trading=20
business once it saw the market was moving toward real-time trading.=20
Coal trading provides Peabody with an additional tool through which it can=20
fulfill its contracted orders, sell its uncontracted coal and produce a=20
sales-trading book of business, he said.=20
Svec said it was too early to determine what impact the Nymex contract may=20
have on its revenue growth.=20
"It has the potential to improve the liquidity in an emerging trading=20
market," Svec said.=20
It also may be too soon for others to judge as well. An official at Massey=20
Energy Co. (MEE), a Richmond, Va., coal company, declined to comment on the=20
upcoming contract and said the company was still "studying the situation."=20
Officials from several other coal companies didn't return phone calls asking=

for comment.=20
The upcoming futures contract also will give large industrial users of coal=20

Wood singled out gas transportation into and within the state as "something=20

Enron to Start Commercial Power, Gas Sales in Alberta (Update1)

Enron to Start Commercial Power, Gas Sales in Alberta (Update1)

     (Closes shares.)

     Houston, June 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has started selling electricity and natural-gas
supply contracts to companies in Alberta, the Houston-based
company's first direct sales effort in Canada.
     Enron, already Canada's biggest wholesale marketer of gas and
electricity, will offer long-term, flexible contracts to
businesses in Alberta, said Rob Milnthorp, chief executive of
Enron's Canadian unit. The company has already started marketing
the energy contracts to Alberta's 100,000 businesses.
     The company said Alberta businesses use about 120 million
gigajoules of gas a year and about 2,800 megawatts of electricity
an hour. A megawatt is enough to light about 1,000 average U.S.
homes.
     Alberta opened its energy markets to competition this year,
the first of Canada's provinces to do so. It later placed price
caps on retail electricity prices that are set to expire next
year.
     Enron Direct won't immediately sell energy to retail
customers in the province, Milnthorp said.
     ``Right now we're in the commercial marketplace. The
residential market will be evaluated,'' he said.
     Enron bought the output of a central Alberta electricity
plant for C$294.8 million ($194.6 million) in a province-run
auction of power generating plants in August. Milnthorp said Enron
will spend a further C$1 billion to operate the plant over the
life of the 20-year contract.
     The Sundance B plant, owned by TransAlta Corp., produces
about 706 megawatts, enough to light 706,000 average U.S. homes.
Enron has been selling power from the plants on a wholesale basis
through Alberta's power grid.
     Since 1990, the company has been buying natural gas from
producers in Alberta, the biggest exporter of the fuel to the U.S.
Under the government's deregulation plan, it can to sell gas
directly to customers using existing pipeline.
     Shares of Enron rose 12 cents to $44.19.


Enron Says Indian Court Defers Decision on Jurisdiction

Enron Says Indian Court Defers Decision on Jurisdiction

     Houston, June 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said an Indian
court deferred a decision on whether a regulatory agency has the
jurisdiction to rule in a dispute between the company and a
regional government that is refusing to pay its power bills.
     The Mumbai High Court gave the Maharashtra Electricity
Regulatory Commission, the regulatory agency, six weeks to decide
whether it has jurisdiction to settle a dispute on termination of
the seven-year-old power-purchase agreement. Enron called the
ruling ``positive.''
     Enron owns Dabhol Power Co., owner of a $3 billion power
plant in Maharashtra state. The project's sole customer is the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which said May 24 that it's
canceling an agreement to buy power from the Dabhol plant.
     The cancellation came after Dabhol Power started proceedings
to end the contract. The board owes 3 billion rupees for power
supplied in December and January.
     Dabhol Power argued that the board didn't have the right to
terminate the contract, and the Maharashtra board referred the
dispute to the commission.
      Dabhol Power sued, arguing that the commission was created
in 1999, after the power purchase agreement was signed, and
therefore doesn't have the authority to decide the dispute.
     ``We are pleased that the court saw the need for timely
action,'' Enron spokesman John Ambler said. ``We continue to have
confidence in the fairness of the court system in India and will
take the steps necessary to satisfactorily resolve the issue.''
     Shares of Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of
Dabhol Power, rose 12 cents to $44.19.
