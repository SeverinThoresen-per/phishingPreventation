Carol,

I spoke with David Forster about the procedures for the auction and the=20
possibility to include a different GTC.  According to him this should not be=
=20
an issue and that we don't need to get Mark Taylor's approval, as this has=20
already been cleared by him for other transactions.  I am going to meet with=
=20
the EOL people again and I will forward you and the team any changes in the=20
procedures if they arise.

Gaurav
