FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage W=
ednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserv=
ed, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   =
I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, askin=
g that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserv=
ed parking spaces in the garage. =20

I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week,=
 however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with =
them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces? =20

I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their =
visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved pa=
rking space that I never get to use! =20

Thanks.  --Sally=20
