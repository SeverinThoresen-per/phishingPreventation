Dan, since you are the guru of these unwindings and whether there are others=
=20

Sandi, I am sending this to you for Data Room background knowledge.

I wanted to update each of you on a number of matters:

1.  On Tuesday of next week we plan to give copies of the Proposed Stock=20
Purchase Agreement and Lease (sublease) to the interested bidders.  The firs=
t=20
data room visits are scheduled to occur on Thursday the seventh.   Chris is=20
going to circulate a revised draft of the Stock Purchase Agreement to=20
everyone later today and everyone on the Enron team should have their=20
comments to me by Friday evening. =20

2.  With respect to the lease, in response to David's inquiry regarding=20
section 3.06, I think we should leave in all the parts of 3.06.  With respec=
t=20
to subpart (v) would it be possible to leave it in but just handle the issue=
=20
of title etc as a rep.  Also, I would like to add a change of control=20
provision to the Lease and provide for a parent guarantee from an entity wit=
h=20
a credit rating acceptable to Enron.  I have yet to receive AnnMarie's=20
comments and questions, but I think you should go ahead and generate a new=20
draft for distribution Friday and AnnMarie will have the opportunity to=20
comment on the revised draft.  I would ask that the revised lease be reviewe=
d=20
by Trina Chandler and Ed Osterberg as well.  Gail, please give me a call and=
=20
we can coordinate getting the revised draft lease to the appropriate=20
parties. =20

3. With respect to the unwind descriptions and the right to use agreement, I=
=20
would appreciate an update and an estimate on when the unwind descriptions=20
and a draft of the exclusive Right to Use agreement would be available.

4.  We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead=20
and transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo=
=20
the marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex=20
contract as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enro=
n=20
and sell the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be n=
o=20
need for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash=
=20
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one=20
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are=20
checking on them now.)

That is all for now.  I will keep you posted as things develop (and change!)=
=2E
