Dave,

Just wanted to update you on the correlations. Luis did not have any high yi=
eld fibers prices that we talked about yesterday. The only thing available w=
as the mixed paper prices which I tried to correlate to tissue but the corre=
lation coefficient came at 15%.

Also, I spoke with Ryan Ogden at Bureau of Labor Stats and it didn't seem li=
ke they had the prices for those recycled products. In any case, I asked him=
 to email me whatever they have in their website in terms of paper prices an=
d I am expecting that email today. Hopefully smth good will come out of that=
=2E
