I like the cedar t-111 version better.  Why don't you tell this shop teacher=
 not to be to comfortable and that you will be taking his job in two years.

Phillip,

Which one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price.

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in=20
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you=20
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are=20
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner=20
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only=20
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most=20
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a=20
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar=20
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have=20
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2" wide door opening.  I would think that=20
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your=20
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold=20
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually=20
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is=20
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum=20
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe=20
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize=20
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your=20
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently=20
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up=20
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be=20
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your=20
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the=20
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday=20
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to=20
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Sincerely,

Mel Nelson
