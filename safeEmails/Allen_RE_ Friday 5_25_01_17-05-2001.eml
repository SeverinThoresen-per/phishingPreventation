Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, rece=
ptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charge=
d to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrati=
ve staff. =20

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 bei=
ng that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the sessio=
n start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  Th=
is would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time=
 permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel
