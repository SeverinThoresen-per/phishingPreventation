service issues from the desk.=20

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of u=
pstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliverie=
s to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, th=
e reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which=
 as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contr=
act for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respon=
d to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to=
 insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issue=
s into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated. =20
