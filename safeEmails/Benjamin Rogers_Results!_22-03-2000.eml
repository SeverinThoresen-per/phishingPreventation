Professor Titman:
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA=20
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it=20
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences,=20
recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my=20
chances and possibly compensate my disability.  After talking with you and=20
Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place t=
o=20
continue learning about energy-finance. =20
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent=20
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what=20
ever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking a couple of graduate=20
level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to=20
demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I als=
o=20
plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be =
a=20
monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment=20
that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.
 Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an=20
Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.  I know that with my industry-wide=
=20
and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund. =
=20
I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very=20
good. =20
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a=
=20
pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy an=
d=20
finance in the future.  Also, if you think of anything else I can do to=20
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know. =20
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
