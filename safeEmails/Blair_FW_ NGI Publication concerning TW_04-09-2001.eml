Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals=20
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the p=
ipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its =
recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for con=
tracts at substantially higher negotiated rates.=20
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Tran=
swestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its =
available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Produc=
ts II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. B=
ut she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson w=
ere considered "moot" by the pipeline until after the available operational =
capacity was posted.=20
"Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before" capacity became availa=
ble, "it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted" at=
 that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, th=
e day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwest=
ern, were "null and void." The only "relevant" ones were those that Transwes=
tern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted.=20
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FER=
C and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about a=
vailable capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its=
 pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson.=20
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern e=
xercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to ship=
pers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the =
pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation se=
rvice to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused =
on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a tota=
l 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March.=20
Richardson and Sempra "clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the=
 posted capacity before it was posted," Miller said in prepared rebuttal tes=
timony. The two companies "had the right to the capacity only 'after' they s=
ubmitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern =
determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agr=
eed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra," she noted.=20
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the=
 contrary, "Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have=
 been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity avai=
lable under substantially higher negotiated rates," Miller testified.=20
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR=
) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold =
capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 =
<http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). =
In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and sh=
ippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at t=
he maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter i=
nto negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securi=
ng some of the capacity if and when [it became] available." But Miller count=
ers that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim."=20
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data requ=
est by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both compa=
nies replied "no" when asked whether "any employee of Transwestern or any Tr=
answestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not =
provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."=20
The "capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recours=
e rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transw=
estern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictio=
ns, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not b=
id for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, includi=
ng Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the =
recourse rate."=20
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotia=
ted-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit.=
 Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that=
 Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1=
=2E3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a "comparable" amount fro=
m Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a "substan=
tially higher" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she did=
n't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit=
 from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million.=20
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffe=
rs would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to=
 acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commi=
ssion's negotiated-rate policy "does not require a minimum level of profit t=
o shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could h=
ave gotten a better deal or made more profits."=20
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider ch=
anges to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case "i=
s the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate po=
licy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group o=
f pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged."=20
