Hello Lindy Lou,

It was such a wonderful surprize to get the nice Halloween card and the ador=

t did Missy, Anthony and Andrew do for Halloween? How is their school year g=
oing? How is the BIG Tone?
Adam and Claire had fun-Adam was Harry Potter and Claire was a lion too!Thin=
gs are really good for me. I cut my hours down to 32 hours a week and it has=
 made all the difference in the world in terms of feeling like I can cope wi=
th this job. It has been taking a toll on me-lots of young patients our age =
dying and stuff. Anyway, things are Great! Marty man is doing good. I worked=
 out with Jody Jurgens last week and it was her 1 year anniversary of being =
married. She's married to a very nice guy. My mom just got back from 18 days=
 in Ireland-her 3rd time. She had a good time. Teresa and her clan were in O=
maha for the game this saturday-what a blowout and Brian and his girlfriend =
(of 2 years) came over. We love her too. We told Brian if they break up were=
 keeping her. Anyway I digress. I was just so touched to get that card from =
you and thought with all that is going on in the country right now, I've rea=
lly reviewed in my life the things that really matter to me, what's really i=
m!
portant. I just want you to know I think of you often. I have pictures of yo=
u and Tony (holdint the baby shoes) and now 2 pics of Sam up in the kitchen =
