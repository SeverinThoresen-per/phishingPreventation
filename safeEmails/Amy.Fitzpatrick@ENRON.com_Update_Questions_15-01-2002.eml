Sally -

I have 2 questions from the list that you provided this evening.

1.  Daren Farmer is on the list for Gas Logistics.  Jeanie advised that Dare=
n resigned and his last day is Friday.  Need a replacement.

2.  Israel Estrada is on the list for Documentation, however, he is no longe=
r showing in our database.  Do we need to add back?

Thanks again!
Amy
