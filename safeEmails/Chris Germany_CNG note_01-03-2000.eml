Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant=20
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many=20
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz=20
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed. =20
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen=20
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable,=20
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,=20

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.=20

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian=20
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.=
 =20
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson=
=20
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,


        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development
