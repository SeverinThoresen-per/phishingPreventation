I'm not sure, Alma, but I thought it is Ricki.

Shelley, Alma coordinates the pager activity for most of the people in the g=
roup, but yours is not one of them.  Would you like Alma to track down the p=
erson at Skytel to return your pager to or would you prefer she just hand it=
 over to Ricki?  We do not want to continue to pay for your pager now that y=
ou have a blackberry.

Rick

any idea who pays for Shelley's pager?
