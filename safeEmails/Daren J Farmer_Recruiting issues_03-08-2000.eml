Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to=20
interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times,=20
even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clyne=

fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately=20
called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is=20
good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to=20
discuss information with me.

improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting m=

decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top=20
of this now.

Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.
