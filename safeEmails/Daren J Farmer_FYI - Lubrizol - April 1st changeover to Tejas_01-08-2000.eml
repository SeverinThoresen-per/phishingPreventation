This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.  We did not get this info.,=20
so Sitara was not adjusted.

Subject: April 1st NG Cut Over




Lee,

On Saturday, April 1st, Lubrizol will cut over natural gas supply from Enron
to Coral at Lubrizol's Bayport plant.

In order to accomplish cut over activities, we will need a technical
representative(s) from Enron at Lubrizol's Bayport plant to participate in
the activities and to insure Enron's interests and assets are protected.

Would you please make arrangements to have an Enron technical
representative(s) report at 12:00 noon, April 1st, to the Main Guard House
at Lubrizol's Bayport plant and ask for Lubrizol's David Massigill.  David
is coordinating all the cut over operations.

If you have any questions about this, please contact me (at the numbers
indicated below) or David Massigill at (281) 479-2851, ext 2511.

Thanks and best regards.

Ray
