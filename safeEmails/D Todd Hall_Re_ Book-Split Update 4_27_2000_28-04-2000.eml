Sally,

I wanted to forward the latest update for the Book-Split Project.  Although=20
you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting, I want you t=
o=20
know that much work and time are being put into this effort.  Paul and Grego=
r=20
are the two Desk Directors for Continental Power who report to Joe Gold. =20
It's good to hear some feedback from them.

As you know, Kristin has now shown some interest in the EBS job with Barry=20
now that Fallen is moving.  When Barry and I first spoke about the position=20
which I would fill, I told him the Fallen might want Kristin since he knows=20
her and has worked with her the last 2 years.  Although the job sounds=20
interesting (Barry's a good salesman), there is not room for both Kristin an=
d=20
myself.  I'll keep you updated on my discussions with Barry.

Thanks for being a sounding board,
Todd
