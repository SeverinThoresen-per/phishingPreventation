S&P and NYBOT Launch New Index Futures and Options Contracts

New York, NY, October 19, 2001 - The New York Board of Trade (NYBOT)
, in partnership with Standard & Poor's, began trading futures contracts thi=
s morning on the S&P Commodity Index (SPCI) - a new standard for commodities=
 pricing. Officials from the New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Devel=
opment as well as NYBOT and Standard & Poor's presided over the launch.

Standard & Poor's, a leading provider of global financial information and in=
vestment analysis, and the New York Board of Trade, a global marketplace for=
 alternative investment products, developed the SPCI to bring greater defini=
tion to traded commodities as an investable asset class. The SPCI was introd=
uced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9, 2001. The SPCI futures and options =
allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios=
 through a single, transparent access point to the investment opportunities =
found in commodity futures markets.=20

"The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11, an=
d on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event, allowing N=
YBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhat=
tan, is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers," said=
 Michael G. Carey, President, New York City Economic Development Corporation=
=2E "Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and=
 trading capital of the world."

"To contribute successfully to long-term portfolio goals, an alternative ass=
et should have certain key characteristics, namely a proper benchmark, trans=
parency, liquidity, simplicity, cost efficiency and flexible trading capabil=
ities," said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D. Fichtel. "SPCI futures and opti=
ons are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for =
a real alternative asset. We believe that these new contracts will prove par=
ticularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment=
 strategies in these difficult economic times."

The NYBOT SPCI futures contract lists six active contract months (January, F=
ebruary, April, June, August, November). Expiration is the second Friday of =
the listed futures contract month, and the contract is cash settled. The fut=
ures contract is valued at $100 x the Index (current contract value approxim=
ately $100,000). Trading hours initially will be 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (New Yo=
rk Time). Options on futures are also offered (see contract specifications).=
=20

"SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure t=
o a diversified commodity basket," said Robert Shakotko, Standard & Poor's M=
anaging Director of Index Services. "Investors around the world recognize th=
e S&P reputation for equity indices and index products. We now bring these s=
ame business strengths to commodities."=20

The SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains, meat and liv=
estock, metals, softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa), fibers, and energy. The index =
utilizes real-time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the co=
mmodities futures markets in New York and Chicago. Key features of the SPCI =
include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment tha=
t eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities.=20

The new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other in=
dex-linked investment products. They offer an easy and efficient way to mana=
ge commodity index funds, commodity-linked insurance products, or commodity =
exposure in multi-asset products. As with its equity indices, Standard & Poo=
r's has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial ins=
titutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative in=
vestment product.

End-of-day index values and index history are available through both the S&P=
 Index Services website at www.spglobal.com <http://www.spglobal.com/indexma=
incommodity.html> and NYBOT's Website at www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com=
/>. The SPCI is calculated every 15 seconds and is available through traditi=
onal real-time quote vendors via the NYBOT; the ticker symbol will be 'I'.=20
