Lynn:

This is a busy place and I know you're quiet busy also.  Sometimes the only =
alternative to communications is emails.

I just wanted to get in touch with you and just let you know that this facil=
ity was finally sold.  The buyer is EOTT.  I have been offered a position wi=
th EOTT and their benefits seem to be comparable to Enron's however there ar=
e some changes.  After 19 years I hate to leave Enron, so I just wanted to s=
ee if you would keep me in mind if any positions become available.  Working =
in the scheduling and nominations area for you with NNG has been the most re=
warding experience in my career and I would love to get back to an areas whe=
re I felt that I excelled.  I know that there has been some changes in the l=
ast few years, however, there is nothing holding me back at this time.   I c=
ertainly would have stayed if my family situation would not have been what i=
t was 5 years ago.  I was not looking for a job, God just seemed to drop it =
down at  time that I needed to do something. =20

Speaking of family, my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful, beauti=
ful, responsible and extremely lovable daughter.  We have become such great =
friends.  The adolescence years gave both of us some major growth in our liv=
es for the best.  She is living in England right now, working and going to c=
ollege.     I am very proud of her.

We are in a transition month, we become EOTT employees effective August 1.  =
I will try to touch base with you i the next couple of days.

Thanks for your consideration.

Nelda
