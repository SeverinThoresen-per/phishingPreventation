FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for=20
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I=
=20
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was n=
o=20
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at=20
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match u=
p=20
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

Thanks,
Mark
