Lynn,

I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for th=
e  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from=
 the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to b=
e the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns =
on this matter please let me know. Thank you.=20

One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for al=
l the individuals involved in this testing.

Terry Kowalke
