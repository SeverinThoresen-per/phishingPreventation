Dear Ken,

	With everything that has happened in the past few weeks, I think we all rea=
lize how dangerous this world truly can be.  As an employee, I appreciate th=
e security measures that Enron has implemented over the years; however, I th=
ink the events of September 11th show that maybe we haven't gone far enough.=
  Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, there are=
 many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houston Polic=
e Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide good basic p=
rotection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Police  would b=
e unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourselves.  The =
Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to respond to l=
ife and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for, a security =
team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or police service.  Th=
ere may come a time, God forbid, when we just have a few moments to act and =
the police may not be available.  If we can't defend ourselves in the first =
few minutes of an act, it could be too late.  I served in an anti-terrorist =
unit in the U.S. Army and have a few ideas that I think could help.  If this=
 is in the realm of possibility, I would be happy to discuss this with whome=
ver you designate.  I do feel safe here at work but planning for the worst, =
before it happens, seems very prudent in these times.  Thanks!

Craig Buehler
