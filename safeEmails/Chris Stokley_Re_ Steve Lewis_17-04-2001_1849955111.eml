Stewart,
	How amazing that this is exactly what we agreed to this morning. You then a=
pparently decided to put yourself back into the process and schedule a meeti=
ng that I did not agree to attend. I made it very clear that it would be dif=
ficult for me to attend a meeting today, but that I could try to break free =
for 2:30. I then thought that it would be on ME not yourself to schedule thi=
s meeting if I was able to break lose from my meeting by 2:30.I left my sche=
dule open most of last week in order to resolve this issue. However, we neve=
r got a response from Steve to allow us to close this item. Before any phone=
 call takes place to Steve tomorrow, you and I will talk about the handling =
of this item going forward. Please stop by at your earliest convenience so t=
hat we can put this issue to rest.


							Chris
