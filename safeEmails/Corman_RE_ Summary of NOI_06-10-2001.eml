I don't think that it is absolutely imperative to attend.  However, we may b=
e able to help Joe define some of the customer benefits of electronic servic=
e.  Can one of the Tobys attend?

Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Documen=
ts, RM01-11. Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to all=
ow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for inter=
ventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two pro=
posals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a =
cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for ou=
r pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.=20
