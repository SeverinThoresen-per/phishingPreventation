Subject:	Wire Transfer Processing

Treasury, SAP, and GCP have been working together for a number of months to =
resolve payment issues.  During this time, Treasury has been reviewing each =
wire transfer manually.  It is now time to move to the next step and allow o=
ur banking system to provide these edits and focus our attention on just the=
 wires that fail the edits.

Treasury has partnered with GCP and SAP to quickly resolve any vendor master=
 and data entry related issues.  This team will be working with business uni=
ts as needed to expedite the correction and reprocessing of payments to meet=
 the commercial needs of Enron.  We will need your cooperation to expedite t=
he turn around on any items in your area.

More detailed resolution procedures will be developed next week and communic=
ated to all of you. =20

Thank you for your help in this process.

Mary Perkins
