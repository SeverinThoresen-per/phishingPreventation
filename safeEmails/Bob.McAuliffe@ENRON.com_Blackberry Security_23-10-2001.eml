Louise,

Jenny Rub asked me to follow-up with you and pass on a summary of security/e=
ncryption on the Blackberry wireless devices.  Sorry it took a couple of day=
s to get this back to you, but I wanted to absolutely re-confirm some of the=
 information before I got a response to you.

We selected the Blackberry service over other wireless email services for tw=
o reasons:

It uses a "push" technology -- mail and calendar information is pushed to yo=
ur Blackberry device without having to connect to a network, logon and "pull=
" the information.
It is the most secure of the alternatives we evaluated.

All Outlook/Exchange email that is synchronized with the Blackberry device i=
s encrypted -- including attachments -- using triple-DES encryption.  Triple=
-DES (data encryption standard) is the most secure encryption standard avail=
able today for civilian/commercial use.  Each Blackberry device has a digita=
l certificate, which is used in conjunction with our Blackberry Enterprise S=
erver to encrypt and decrypt Exchange mail.  The Blackberry Enterprise Serve=
r is the interface server to our Exchange environment and resides inside our=
 firewall.  Therefore, all Enron Exchange mail is encrypted before it leaves=
 the Enron environment and is not decrypted until it reaches each Blackberry=
 device.

There are some limitations, however.  There are three ways to communicate wi=
th a Blackberry device -- not all are encrypted.

Your Exchange mail is synchronized with your Blackberry through the Blackber=
ry Enterprise Server -- this form of communication is encrypted using the tr=
iple-DES standard.
You can communicate between Blackberry devices using "PIN-to-PIN" paging -- =
this form of communication does not pass through the Blackberry Enterprise S=
erver and is not encrypted.  However, it is scrambled -- but not using a sop=
histicated algorithm and it can be decoded easily by a sophisticated hacker.
You can communicate with Blackberry users via Skytel's paging service by mai=
ling to username@skytel.com (e.g. bobmcauliffe@skytel.com) -- this form of c=
ommunication is sent via clear text, so it is not encrypted or scrambled.

The bottom line is that all mail sent from/to Outlook/Exchange or internet m=
ail sent to an @enron.com mail address is encrypted. =20

If you want a little more information on triple-DES encryption, a good overv=
iew is at http://www.tropsoft.com/strongenc/des3.htm or if you want more inf=
ormation on our Blackberry service, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bob
