Ed and Bill:
Per Leslie reeves, we did receive a payment from LG&E Energy Marketing so th=
e only issue remaining on them is whether the LC has been renewed.  As Ed re=
ported, El Paso renewed their LC so there is nothing to do on that.  With re=
spect to Enserco, I faxed the proposed new LC to ed and spoke with Don Perki=
ns, their credit manager (303) 568-3255.  I told him that he may be receivin=
g a call from you regarding Fortis, the Issuer.  I also told him that drawin=
g condition #1 would have to change to take out the reference to delivery of=
 natural gas and he agreed.  He was also going to talk to Lynn Evans, his at=
torney, about the procedures that need to be followed under 'Special Instruc=
tions" as I do not think that we should be sending anything to Fortis.  More=
 to come tomorrow.


Ed:
Please e-mail me, Sara and Jeff a description of where things stand with Nia=
gara based on their payment today as it sounds complicated and may require u=
s to piece together all of the contracts we have with them before deciding h=
ow to proceed.  Did you have any luck confirming the status of the  Chase LC=
?


Sara,
Let's meet in the morning.  We also will probably here from Lyn Evans, Enser=
co's lawyer.
