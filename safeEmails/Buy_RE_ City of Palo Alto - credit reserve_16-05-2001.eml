costs. (Unless you are the taxpayer). Tx for update, Rick

Rick,

The muni's in CA have had the ability to purchase power out in the market si=
nce they never signed on to CA's deregulation plan in '98.  Initially, the r=
ating agencies were bullish on the IOU's and bearish on the munis assuming t=
hat the munis would not get the benefit of recovering stranded costs in a ti=
mely manner.  However, as we've seen lately with all of the turmoil in CA, t=
heir perspectives have changed.  Also, Palo Alto's affluent customer base is=
 1/3 local and 2/3 commuters and is mainly comprised of schools including St=
anford University and the Palo Alto School District.  Palo Alto in fact has =
one of the lowest unemployment rates in Santa Clara County.

We are basing our credit terms in all of the trading contracts to reflect th=
e following:

-that we can only go to the proprietary 'enterprise' funds s.a. electric, ga=
s and water funds for recourse and NOT the general fund
-the debt covenants tied to the utility revenue bonds reflect the net revenu=
e pledge allocation of those enterprise funds to service the annual DS
-Palo Alto overall has minimal debt levels and the fact that the majority of=
 the assets in the funds are comprised of rate stabilization fund reserves
-inclusion of Palo Alto's ability to raise rates sufficient to cover operati=
ng costs and annual DS as a MAC (I truly value this covenant)
-tiered margining lines based on S&P and Moody's ratings

Hope that helps.

Tracy
