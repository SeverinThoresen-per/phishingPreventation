Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up =
to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the =
following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed un=
der US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if =
a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term S=
heet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a brea=
k-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit =
to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more informa=
tion.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want =
them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new produc=
t launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product=
 would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have t=
o post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and =
they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someon=
e may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as=
 there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and Jo=
hn and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  S=
hort answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now. =20

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post =
something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confi=
rmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain=
 customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm tol=
d we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to=
 get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I thin=
k it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind t=
his idea before we launched into development.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk=
 to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We hav=

in the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week)=
 so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and forme=
rly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two a=
reas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true cust=
omer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo al=
ong with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to corre=
cting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance =
that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obv=
iously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of op=
portunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this somethin=
g of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Housto=
n in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a me=
eting at Enron.=20
