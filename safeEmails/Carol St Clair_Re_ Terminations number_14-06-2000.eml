This would be any ETA amendment to Sections 6(a) and 6(e).  Enclosed is one=20
example.  I don't think that we did that many because this number has only b=
e=20
out there for a few weeks.

Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have=
=20
sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection=
=20
is that maybe only 1 or 2 did.

Carol,

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number.=20
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana=
=20
be handling the change notification?

Dave
