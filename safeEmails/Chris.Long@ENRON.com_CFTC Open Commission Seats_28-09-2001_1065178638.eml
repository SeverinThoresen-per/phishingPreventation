There are two open Republican seats on the CFTC.  The White House is intervi=
ewing prospective candidates.  The leading candidates are:  Walt Luken, Prof=
essional Staff Member on the Senate Agriculture Minority Staff; Ryan Weston,=
 Professional Staff on the House Agriculture Majority Staff; and Sharon Brow=
n-Hruska, an economist with the Mercatur Center and friend of Wendy Gramm's.

I have been asked by Walt Luken to be a reference for his candidacy.  Walt w=
as instrumental in the CFMA, especially on the energy/metals exemption and i=
s a pro-market supporter.  Linda and I know Walt well and believe he would b=
e a good candidate.  Lisa has met with Walt.  We know his philosophical back=
ground and he is a friend of Enron.  I would like to be able to help him by =
being a reference.

Ryan Weston is also a friend of Enron and is pro-market.  His somewhat less =
experienced that Walt, but would be a good choice as well..

We do not know much about Sharon Brown-Hruska expect she worked at the CFTC =
from 1990-1995 and holds a PhD in Finance.  Steve and Rick - Could you find =
out if we have made a commitment to Wendy Gramm on Brown-Hruska. =20

An ideal combination for the CFTC, would be to have Walt and/or Ryan.  Howev=
er, there is some consensus that a Commissioner with a strong financial back=
ground would be beneficial. =20

Please advise.
