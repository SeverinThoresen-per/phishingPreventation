Vince, recently we found out that some of the people in our group (ETS Logis=
tics - located on the 41st floor) do not have access to SAP - we called the =
SAP Help Desk and they directed us to fill out the proper forms and at the s=
ame time told us that it would take about 10 days to 2 weeks for us to get t=
hat access.  I was wondering if there is any way that we could get that soon=
er than the 10 days to 2 weeks. The people that recently sent in those forms=
 are Joe Linhart, Harry Woodson, Randy Janzen and Jacob Conklin.  Please let=
 me know what you might be able to do to accomodate us - we really need to g=
et into SAP as soon as possible.

Thanks so much for your help,

Raetta Zadow
