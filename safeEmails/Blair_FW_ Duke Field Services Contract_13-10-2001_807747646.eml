In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 10107=
3 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead=
 use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas=
 Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could y=
ou please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 mont=
hs?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily=
 Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this wil=
l give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate =
the 2 contracts.=20
Thanks,
