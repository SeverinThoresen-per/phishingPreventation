Hi Michelle... just wanted to follow-up to see if you were planning on
attending the HR NEPCO training on August 2 and 3rd (Thursday and Friday) or
if Rick was planning on attending.  If you could let me know via e-mail or
phone (425-415-3099) it would be helpful.  Also, if you have a presentation
(30 - 60 minutes) that you would like to present we have blocked you some
time.  If you have the presentation in power-point and would like to e-mail
that in advance to me as we are compiling everything together for this
meeting it would be helpful.

Thanks Michelle and I look forward to meeting you.
Connie Brown

Michelle, attached is the agenda for the NEPCO  HR field training that
Mike Indivero has scheduled for his Team.  They have allotted
approximately 30 -  45 minutes to help us introduce ourselves to the
team.  Mike and I had briefly discussed using the time to explain the
subject matter expertise and services that OLER is prepared to provide.
You indicated that you would use the opportunity to go out to Seattle,
given that I had contemplated using vacation on August  1& 2.  I can
easily alter my vacation dates and attend if the trip fails to
compliment your work / travel schedule.   Mike Indivero has a widely
dispersed HR organization and they face many challenges unique to the
merit shop / construction world.  I'm sure they will enjoy the
opportunity to meet you.=20
