This is a Sithe Energies transaction and in no way has anything to do with o=
ur
Sithe/Independence transactions.  However, we need to make sure when the
contract is terminated, none of our Sithe/Independence contracts are=20
affected.=20
These other contracts are one ANR, PEPL, Union, TCPL, Empire, and NiMo.

Thanks, Diane
