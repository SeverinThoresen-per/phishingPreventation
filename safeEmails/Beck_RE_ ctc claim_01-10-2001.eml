If I were you, I would talk to Wanda and let her know that Ken is the point =
person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trus=
t that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she =
is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical d=
ata and forward actions must be confirmed with Ken.  Let me know if you woul=
d like me to underscore this with Wanda, and I will be glad to.  Might be a =
good idea to send a note to Dave, Janet and Dan stating that legal has named=
 Wanda as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and executio=
n that Ken must be fully involved - and that you have asked Wanda to make th=
at part of her responsibility.  Copy Wanda on the note.  --Sally=20

We just need to make sure we keep an eye on her
