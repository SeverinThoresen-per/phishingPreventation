Phillip,

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.


Sincerely,


Greg Thorse
