=09
	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about c=
overage
	by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs.

	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.

		Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 wit=
h the team.

		John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with=
 the NNG team

		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with=
 the NNG team

	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

		Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams dur=
ing this time frame

	Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.

	Thanks. Lynn
