India: Reinsurance rates rise 20 pc

Asia Intelligence Wire

BANGALORE, June 27. REINSURANCE rates for India have escalated by 20 per cen=
t=20
during the last three months. This escalation comes after the premiums went=20
up by 50 per cent in March this year.=20
Industry sources attributed this to the rising claims from the power sector=20
and the increase in the potential for claims by the sector.
Such potential is estimated by the industry using a methodology called the=20
"Probable Maximum Claim" ratios.=20
After this increase, reinsurance premiums are currently in the range of abou=
t=20
0.58 per cent of the sum assured. Till March this year, the premiums were in=
=20
the region of 0.47 per cent and in January it was about 0.25 per cent.=20
The claims from the energy sector have been on account of natural disasters=20
as well as accidents. Most of the claims are currently from the private=20
sector, specially in the generation segment. This is because very few of the=
=20
transmission / distribution companies' assets have been insured. Wherever=20
insurance cover has been taken, it has been mostly in externally- funded=20
projects.=20
Current estimates of reinsured assets in the country are in the region of=20
about Rs 2,500 crore. This approximately translates into a premium outflow o=
f=20
about Rs 900 crore. This volume by international standards is treated as low=
=2E=20
In March when the premiums escalated, this was one of the reasons cited.=20
Moreover,, the sources said, during the last few months there had been a=20
weakening of the sentiment for India. Hence, the hardening of reinsurance=20
premiums. Among the reasons cited for the weakening were fears within the=20
reinsurance community that some of the force majeure clauses covering the=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) might be invoked.=20
DPC is insured for both political as well as non-political risks.=20
The fear is that the political risk component could be invoked by the projec=
t=20
promoters, Enron International, leading to high claims from the insurance=20
companies, which in turn was likely to devolve on to the reinsurers. Among=20
the reinsurers involved in providing cover to Enron international are=20
engineering insurance companies such as Munich Re.=20
The increase in premiums could also be on account of the low capital adequac=
y=20
levels of some of the new insurance entrants in the Indian market. For these=
=20
new companies, the retention levels, the ability to absorb claims into their=
=20
own balance sheet is low. Consequently, the premiums also tend to be on the=20
high side. On the other hand, the public sector companies have a capital=20
adequacy of a minimum of about Rs 2,000 crore and have high retention=20
abilities.=20
As a result, the companies that have been most affected by the premium=20

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Senate investigatory committee may seek contempt=20
sanctions Thursday against power generators that have not turned over=20

If the Senate agrees, it would be the first such move since 1929.
"These are the same documents we requested April 5, and to date the summary=20
is: three months, zero documents," said Laurence Drivon, special counsel to=20
the Senate Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation.=20
The Senate Rules Committee subpoenaed the documents - which include details=20

by law, "the Senate can take such action as it deems necessary and=20

"We're been working with this (Senate) committee for weeks now, for over a=20

Impact: Why Won't Vice President Cheney Say Who He Got Advice From on the=20
Energy Crisis?
Bill O'Reilly

O'REILLY: In the "Impact" segment tonight, why won't Vice President Cheney=20
tell us who he got advice from on the energy crisis?=20
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has asked=20
Cheney for a list of people he has talked with because some Democrats are=20
charging that big donors to the GOP are getting more access to Cheney than=20
other Americans. So far, Mr. Cheney has not turned over the list.
His office told us that the GAO has no legal right to know who the vice=20
president talked with and that making names public would discourage people=20
from seeking an audience with government officials.=20
You may remember Hillary Clinton tried to do the same thing with her=20
health-care debacle.=20
Joining us now from Arlington, Virginia, is "USA Today" energy and economics=
=20
correspondent Jonathan Weisman who is following the story.=20
JONATHAN WEISMAN, "USA TODAY": How are you?=20
O'REILLY: I -- I'm not -- I'm not getting why Cheney won't turn this over. I=
=20
mean, I know that they're saying the GAO doesn't have a right and all this=20
stuff. But so what? Just turn the list over, right?=20
WEISMAN: Yeah. Well, you know, they say that there's a principle here, that=20
they feel like they -- they won't be able to get free and unfettered advice=20
if whoever goes into the Oval Office is going to get grilled by the press=20
afterwards.=20
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I mean, a lot of people who go into=20
the Oval Office go to the press and brag about it. In fact, I talked to the=20
-- the chairman of Enron, the big natural gas company, told me all about a=20
meeting with the Cheney task force and all the advice that he had given him.=
=20
It doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean, they must just feel like it would be=
=20
embarrassing to see a big list of a bunch of energy executives who had met=20
with the Cheney task force.=20
O'REILLY: So you think that it's -- that possible -- and we -- this is=20
conjecture. I don't like to do conjecture, but because there's no reason --=20
concrete reason in my mind that this list wouldn't be put out there that it'=
s=20
possible the list is stacked to the right with GOP donors and people who are=
,=20
you know, looking out for the energy area rather than the environmental area=
?=20
WEISMAN: Yeah, it's certainly possible. I mean, I -- I actually know some=20
environmentalists and some -- kind of the -- actually, old Clinton people wh=
o=20
met with the energy task force to share their views.=20
I know that both sides did do these meetings, but, I mean, by the way they'r=
e=20
being very cautious about releasing these names, you've got to think that=20
there must -- there must be something to...=20
O'REILLY: Yeah. Well, if it's 10-1, that's not going to look too good, and=20
that's the...=20
WEISMAN: Exactly.=20
O'REILLY: ... and that's why Democrats want it. They -- they want to=20
embarrass the Bush-Cheney administration, correct?=20
WEISMAN: Oh, the Democrats are looking for any way to make a Clinton era-typ=
e=20
controversy stick to the Bush people, and this one just worked perfectly=20
because, you know, it -- it was Hillary Rodham Clinton's task force that met=
=20
secretly that got grilled.=20
In fact, it was -- it was actually a civil suit against Hillary's task force=
=20
that forced them to release all -- all their names. There hasn't been a civi=
l=20
suit filed, but these two Democratic members of Congress asked the GAO to do=
=20
an investigation, and the GAO took them up on it.=20
O'REILLY: All right. So we -- we've got to know that the motives are=20
political, that the Democrats want to embarrass Cheney and Bush, and they=20
might have an opportunity, if Cheney and Bush sought the counsel of, you=20
know, the energy industry people, the drilling people, and the -- and the=20
fossil fuel people, and then very few on the other side. So that could be=20
a...=20
WEISMAN: Right.=20
O'REILLY: ... a potential source of embarrassment, but I...=20
WEISMAN: Right.=20
O'REILLY: I believe that all -- this isn't a big story as far as Americans=20
are concerned. Just throw it out there. It's going to last for 10 seconds,=20
no?=20
WEISMAN: Well, the -- the funny thing is, when it was just, you know, Henry=20
Waxman and John Dingell, these representatives from Congress just kind of=20
badgering the White House, nobody paid much attention to it. It looked like =
a=20
little partisan spat, right?=20
As soon as the GAO, though, sent this letter saying, "Release this -- releas=
e=20
this information or else," it was elevated to a different realm.=20
Now it looks more like a battle between Congress, represented by its=20
investigative arm, the GAO, and the White House...=20
O'REILLY: Right.=20
WEISMAN: ... and it becomes a much bigger deal.=20
O'REILLY: Well, I think -- but the big deal for the people, and I don't care=
=20
about the GAO or Cheney's office or any of that, but the folks have a right=20
to know what's going on. I mean, that's the bottom line on this.=20
WEISMAN: Yeah, it looks -- it looks like they're hiding.=20
O'REILLY: Yeah. Well, they are. They are. They are hiding. Just like Hillary=
=20
Clinton hid her list, Cheney's hiding his list. That's what they're doing. I=
t=20
doesn't look like it. That's what it is. I believe in open government. I wan=
t=20
to know...=20
WEISMAN: Yeah. And then...=20
O'REILLY: ... who's going in and what they're doing because the Clinton=20
administration abused that so by having Johnny Chung in there and everybody=20
else. I don't want that to continue.=20
I'll give you the last word on it.=20
WEISMAN: OK.=20
O'REILLY: The last...=20
WEISMAN: All right. Well, let me tell you. One -- one other thing. They --=20
they make a lot of legal arguments about why the GAO doesn't have access and=
,=20
you know, I'm not a lawyer, maybe they're absolutely right, but, you know,=20
the Clinton administration also made a lot of legal arguments, and we're=20
getting -- we're getting kind of tired of legal arguments.=20
O'REILLY: I -- I know I am, and I think everybody wants open government.=20
Mr. Weisman, thanks very much for your time.=20
WEISMAN: You're welcome.=20
O'REILLY: Plenty more ahead as THE FACTOR moves along this evening.=20
Will your investments come back? The Fed cuts interest rates again, but some=
=20
still say Alan Greenspan is not doing the job.=20
And then ABC News correspondent John Stossel in the middle of yet another=20
controversy. This time over kids and the environment. We'll talk with him.=20

Senators Ask Army Chief to Step Away From Energy Issue

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press=20
WASHINGTON -- Two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee are asking=20
the new Army secretary to remove himself from any involvement with contracts=
=20
for military base utilities because of his ties to an energy company that is=
=20
pursuing the business.
Sens. John McCain (R., Ariz.), and Jean Carnahan (D., Mo.), made the request=
=20
Wednesday in response to a June 19 story by The Associated Press about Army=20
Secretary Thomas White's ties to Enron Energy Services, where he served as=20
vice chairman until earlier this year.=20
The two senators wrote the Army chief that they believe he should step aside=
=20
from the utility issue for at least a year to avoid the appearance of a=20
conflict of interest.=20
"No matter how impartial you would strive to be, the fact that you were=20
vice-chairman of Enron, have owned a substantial amount of Enron stock, and=20
recently lobbied on behalf of Enron on this very issue would raise in the=20
public's mind a question about whether your decisions would be totally=20
unbiased," they wrote.=20
Army spokeswoman Capt. Amy Hannah said Mr. White has "received the letter an=
d=20
is currently studying the letter."=20
Mr. White has said he would recuse himself from Enron-related decisions if=20
there was a clear conflict of interest. He has been consulting with lawyers=20
on the question while selling his more than $25 million in Enron stock.=20
AP reported that Mr. White has been pressing to shift control of more=20
military base utilities into private hands, a multimillion-dollar business=20
Enron is pursuing. While at the company, Mr. White played an active role in=20
pushing for such contracts.=20
Sens. McCain and Carnahan, whose committee reviewed the Army secretary's=20
nomination, told White that even if he sells his stock, "there would be a=20
clear appearance of a conflict of interest" if he takes part in any matters=20
related to Army utility privatization for at least a year.=20
At the least, the Pentagon should release its determination on whether the=20
value to the government of Mr. White's participation in the issue "outweighs=
=20
the very significant appearance problems that such participation would=20
entail," the senators wrote.=20
In a cost-cutting move in December 1998, the Pentagon ordered each branch of=
=20
the service to hire energy companies to run the electric, natural gas and=20
other utilities on military bases.=20
Mr. White said earlier this month that the program should be moving faster.=20
He noted that the Army's Fort Hamilton in New York is the only Army base to=20
turn over all of its utilities to a private company. Enron won the $25=20
million, 10-year contract in 1999.=20
"I see no reason whatsoever why the Army is in the energy business," Mr.=20
White said. "It's a stupid business practice for the Army to be running=20
itself that way."=20
Enron has a bid pending to run utilities at several Texas bases, including=20
seven Air Force bases, a naval base and the Army's Fort Bliss in Texas.=20
