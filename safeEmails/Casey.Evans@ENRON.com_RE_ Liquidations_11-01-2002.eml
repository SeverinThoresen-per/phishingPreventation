The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while =
before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations bec=
ause we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am work=
ing on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language =
in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we =
have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys thin=
k?

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the f=
in liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the =
liquidations for Dec are not final?=20

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have inc=
luded that in the book requests?
