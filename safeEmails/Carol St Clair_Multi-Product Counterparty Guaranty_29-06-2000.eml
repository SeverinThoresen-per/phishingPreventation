Mary:
Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Produc=
t=20
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each=20
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper=20
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but=
=20
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more=20
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be=20
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to=20
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the=
=20
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.


Carol
