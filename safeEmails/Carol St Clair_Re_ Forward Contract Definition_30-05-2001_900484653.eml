I believe that it was and I'm checking with Chris Long on this.  As soon as =
I=20
hear back from him I will call you.  Also, I'm having my assistant look into=
=20
where those materials that you sent ended up.  Thanks.

Carol, it would help if I knew what was on the table. For example, does the=20
proposed amendment already redefine forward contracts?  Give me a call. =20
Thanks.=20

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political=20
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".=
 =20
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine i=
f=20
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it=20
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an=20
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward=20
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with=20
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sur=

what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity t=

suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
