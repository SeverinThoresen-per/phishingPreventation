This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with=20
different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and=20
should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand=20
expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ?=20

Thanks,
Brenda
