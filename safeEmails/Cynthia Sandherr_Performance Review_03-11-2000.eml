Hi, Rick:  It is only today that I have discovered you are my "direct boss"=20
in the context of my performance review.  Since the Organizational chart=20
reflects that I report to Joe Hillings and since I have not been invited to=20
participate in any of your Direct Report Conference calls nor meetings, I ha=
d=20
no clue until today of this change.  In fact, in the almost eleven years I=20
have worked for Enron, Joe Hillings has always been my "direct boss" in the=20
context of my performance reviews.

I give you this background only because I feel disadvantaged in not knowing=20
this sooner.  Specifically, there is not a day that goes by when I do not=20
report directly to Joe Hillings about what I am doing, copy him on memos,=20
etc. whereas, I rarely, if ever, bother you with this daily reporting.  Sinc=
e=20
you are, in fact, my direct boss, it seems you should have been copied on al=
l=20
these memos, updates, etc. instead of or in addition to Joe Hillings plus it=
=20
seems I should have been included in the Direct Report meetings and calls.

=46rom this day forward, I will copy you on everything I send to Joe Hilling=
s. =20
I assume I should continue to copy Joe on everything I send you plus now als=
o=20
add Linda Robertson?  When Linda Robertson comes on board, will I remain a=20
direct report to you?  Should I now begin participating in your direct repor=
t=20
regular phone calls and attend the Direct Report meetings?  Please advise.

Further, the Performance Review written policy was understood by me whereby =
I=20
select my reviewers who must be a peer or higher, then discuss my selections=
=20
with my boss and then together I am advised who my boss agrees will be=20
reviewing me.   This time, apparently non-peers were selected to review me=20
and I am unaware of the selections made for me (other than those who were=20
selected who have told me about their selection.)  Rick, shouldn't just peer=
s=20
or higher rate me or has there been a policy change whereby everyone in the=20
company is now having a 360 review?  Further, at least one of those selected=
=20
to review me has not worked with me all year since our issue areas never=20
intersected.  Shouldn't only those who have worked directly with me be in a=20
position to review me?

Those employees whom I have worked with most closely this year who are a pee=
r=20
or higher include:  Joe Hartsoe, Tom Briggs, Joe Hillings, Dean Tarbet, Bill=
=20
Votaw and Tom White.  I would hope you would ask these folks to conduct a=20
review on my performance.

I welcome reporting to you.  I am just embarrassed to find out about this=20
good news only today in that I've done little to "report" to you.  Joe=20
Hillings can certainly testify to the fact he has received ample reporting=20
from me.  Again, I will rectify this immediately.    Many thanks!  Cynthia
