I need to push back our call 30 minutes.  Does 10:30 your time still work?

Carol,
Thank you so much for sending me an e-mail!  My traders are pushing hard to
get an agreement in place with Enron.
I have some time tomorrow morning around 10AM Eastern Time.  Would you be
available at that time to discuss?
Thanks,

Kendal Bowman

Kendal:

I have taken over some of Janice Moore's files since her departure from
Enron, one of them being the EEI Master with CP&L.  Could you please call
me when convenient to discuss where things stand and what needs to be done
to finalize it?  I will be out of the office this Friday and next Monday.
Thanks.
