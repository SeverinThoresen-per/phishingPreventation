Oliver correctly pointed out that UK Power's Temporary VaR and NOP ratchet=20
down by $1.35MM VaR and 8.5 Twh, respectively, on 1/1/01.  So instead of the=
=20
limits in the e-mail message below,  UK Power's VaR and NOP are as follows:

   now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 12/31/00 1/1/01 - 1/5/01 1/6/01

UK Power VaR   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $18.95MM $13.95MM

UK Power NOP   68 Twh   68 Twh  59.5 Twh $59.5 Twh

Subject: Upcoming Discretionary VaR Limit Changes

Per discussion with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy, the following policy limit=20
changes are anticipated.  Note:  these are subject to change given market=20
volatility.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------>=
=20
EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01

Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ---------->=20
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM

NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------>=20
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ---------------->=20
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------->=20
EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01

       -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.



Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:


   now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 1/5/01 1/6/01
EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM

NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM

UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM

Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM



Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.

Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You=
=20
can check with Ted to see if he did already.

Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the=
=20
commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an=20
extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and=20
presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and=20
Ted Murphy to approve.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I'm out on vacation this week, but=
=20
can be reached at home or on my cell phone.

Happy Holidays,
Cassandra.
