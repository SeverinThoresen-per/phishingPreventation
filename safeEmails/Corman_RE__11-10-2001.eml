Shelley,
       I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan=
 yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in =
through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and =
I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and =
maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by=
 tomorrow.  Thanks.

Dan
