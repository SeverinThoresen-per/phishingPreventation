Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart curr=
ent as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for you=
r respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in=
 to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate st=
aff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff sup=
port should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your te=
am would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the followin=
g Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

Thanks
