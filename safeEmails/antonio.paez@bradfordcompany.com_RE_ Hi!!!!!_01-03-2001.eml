Tony,

Whats up?  Hey I think that Mexico is playing US tomorrow in Ohio for the
World Cup qualifying.  Is Mexico any good?  Should we wager on the match?
Hope things are going well with you.  Talk to you soon.

My work number is (713) 853-6247 if you want to call me anytime.  I got a
promotion.  I am now trading Natural Gas Options.  We trade them over the
internet also.  We have a website (Enron Online) that we make markets on
many different commodities and we just started making option markets in
natural gas a couple of months ago.  I am helping with this.

Tell your family hi and have a great day.

John
