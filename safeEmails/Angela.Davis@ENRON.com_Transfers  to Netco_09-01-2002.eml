Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to de=
lete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining=
 access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be wa=
rned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  Howev=
er, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this informati=
on would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to=
 delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?
