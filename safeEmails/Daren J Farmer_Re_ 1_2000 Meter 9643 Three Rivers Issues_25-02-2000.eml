Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting=20
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would=
=20
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID? =20

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement=20
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it=20
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend th=
e=20
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set u=
p=20
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number=20
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set=20
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so yo=
u=20
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred
