Mark:
I know you must be very busy right now.  I do have a important favor to ask.=
  I am worried about the reaction should the names and numbers of the tradin=
g retention pool be made public.  If you get notice of if and when that is t=
o happen, advanced warning would be very helpful.  If I cannot be reached at=
 the office, my cell phone number is 713-557-3330. =20
Thanks,
John
