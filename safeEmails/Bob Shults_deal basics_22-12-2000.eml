Bob, here you go.? Lets work up a more formal  term sheet and go from there.
?
In short, for  us to accept a licensing fee and no commission when our=20
brokers hit/lift
over  the phones an EOL number with Enron traders, we're looking to receive
from  Enron:
??? - Access to EOL numbers in worldwide natural gas,  power, bandwidth, and
oil petroleum markets.? We feel strongly that  Amerex has built leadership o=
r
solid intermediary positions in all these  markets, and that should greatly
benefit Enron and EOL, as well as benefit  Amx.
??? - Until Amx notifies EOL, we interact with EOL on a  view and phone call
basis, essentially in keeping with doing business with  Enron traders just
like we do now, accept we see the bid/ask on line as well  as in voice.? But
with notice from Amx, EOL will program the Amx  interaction to allow Amx
brokers to hit/lift on a keyboard  function
??? - That Amx pays the license fee of $250k for the  first year, on a
monthly basis.
??? - At the end of the one  year period, there will be no greater increase
in the license fee than 10%,  and the license fee can be reduced, subject to
both parties'  agreement.
??? - We are keeping this confidential, and would  request that EOL and Enro=
n
does not even indicate that a broker or a Houston  broker, or some other
indirect reference of a deal with a brokerage or Amx is  made to the market.

Look forward to hearing from you.
All the best
Steve
