Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May. =20
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this=20
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us. =20

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take th=
e=20
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management=20
group.

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought f=
or
4/1 and would there be any cost?
