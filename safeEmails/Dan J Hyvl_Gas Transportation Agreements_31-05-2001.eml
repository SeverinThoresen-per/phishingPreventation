 At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and=20
intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy=20
Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed=20
this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement=20
utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve=20
them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL=
,=20
I would approve them for execution. =20
 Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the=
=20
charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get=20
out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be=20
negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the=20
transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are=20
reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services. =
 =20
 No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star=20
Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request=
=20
forms. =20
