I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event=
 by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably w=
ouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in =
the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop. =20

Would it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbanc=
e, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.

Thanks!

Michelle

I booked the Santa lunch and have you guys down for 3.  Sat. Dec. 1 at 11:30=
 am.  No cancellations after Nov. 23, so just let me know before then if the=
 other event presents a conflict.  Dress Cameron in his Christmas finery for=
 his photo with Santa!
