John, Please don't kill the messenger, but Lamar Power called along with CMS=
 Marketing today asking that the Scheduled Quantities Report please be reins=
tated.  This report included receipt and delivery volumes, a summary, as wel=
l as, Month to date information. The new report gives them very little to wo=
rk with and a lot of information they don't need on this report.
