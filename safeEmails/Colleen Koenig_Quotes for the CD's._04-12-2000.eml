Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97=20
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after=20
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not=20
included in this figure. =20

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is=20
currently being tabulated).

Colleen

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing=20
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included.=20
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming -=
