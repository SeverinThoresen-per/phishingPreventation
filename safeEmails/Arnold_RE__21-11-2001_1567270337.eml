John,

Hello and good Monday morning to you.  I briefly meet you while talking to P=
aul Racicot on Friday at Front Porch Pub.  With Matt working here in Freight=
 you probably already know we are not well off these days.  Next on the chop=
ping block is never a good place to be. =20

This is a forward question but what the hell.  I was wondering if you knew o=
f any positions available in your area.  If you can believe it I am not read=
y to leave Enron behind yet.  Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Kristin Gandy
