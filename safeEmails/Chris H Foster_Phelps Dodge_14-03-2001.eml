I spoke to Choi Lee today.  It is hard for me to remain professional with hi=
m=20
as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was ver=
y=20
cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of=20
substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below=20
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the=20
"$50 - $60" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the "70=
s=20
and the 80s."  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy=
,=20
but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't=20
have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave=
=20
it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the=20
opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect=20
they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining=20
operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With=20
APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't mak=
e=20
much money anyway.

Please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a=20
electricy price quote for a structure you are working on.

Thanks!

Chris
