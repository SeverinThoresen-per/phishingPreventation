No sir...if I can possibly remember that far back through the years of brain=
 cell depletion, our softball park was North of 610 off of Ella, I believe. =
Needless to say, glad you'll be in attendance!!!!

I'm there.  I just checked a map and saw that it is just north of Montie
Beach Park.  Didn't we play softball there back in high school?

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about
our impending "foursome"??? Very "excited"  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT
CHANGE, heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will
be Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they
DO have security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day
laborers drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and
lime, dining next to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good
Fun. Kind of like a good noodle house or other oriental type place...if
you see the natives eating there, you know it's good. Besides after
listening to Joe and Chet, I would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately "sign" to the
non-English speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon
arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Eat me, Wollam.  Did you notice the "Out of Office" message from my
email,
home slice?

Not sure what the 20 "MAN NIGHT" emails are in my inbox from yesterday,
but
noted the Thurs. night dinner.  I have conflict which I will try to
unwind
for my attendance.  However, not sure that we want to be at Tony's on
such
night, based on what my co-worker says!
