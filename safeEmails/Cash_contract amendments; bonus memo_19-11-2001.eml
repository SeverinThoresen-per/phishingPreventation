Kriste,

I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are comple=
te.  The only one in question is for Brian Redmond, whose contract we did no=
t have.  Jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to =
Twanda.  Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and =
get it to Kriste for finalizing. =20

Then (I hope) we'll be done!!!!

Thanks.

Michelle
