Hello Mr. Temple,

This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the subject =
of Fiber morphology. Attached you will find the fiber characteristics spread=
sheet - the most updated version.=20

We also have an additional question which is - why each quality parameter (t=
he column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) applica=
tion.

You can contact me for any further questions.


thanks,
