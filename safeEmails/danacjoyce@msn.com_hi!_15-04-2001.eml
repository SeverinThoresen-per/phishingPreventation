Hi Paul.  I received your message earlier this year and accidentally erased =
it.  When I called information to get your number, a really young woman (twe=
nty-something) answered the phone number I was given....  She told me I had =
the wrong number but I'm still wondering...  Anyway, hopefully you'll receiv=
e this and reply with your current home number.  Are you still in Puerto Ric=
o?  You'll have to tell me about your experience there.  Let me know if you =
receive this and I'll write back...  Talk to you soon...
