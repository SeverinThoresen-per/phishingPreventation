Rick,

Kelly Johnson called and asked for a copy of a presentation that you mention=
ed to Paula Rieker as presented recently to the Finance Committee.  She said=
 it was called "Distribution of Risk - Enron's Information Advantage".  I do=
n't believe this was included in the formal Finance Committee Book in the pa=
st year.  Do you know when it was presented and who prepared the presentatio=
n?  I will track down a copy for Paula and for our records.

Thanks for your help,

Sharon Sullo
