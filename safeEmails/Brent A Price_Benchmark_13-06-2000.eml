FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will=20
require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be=20
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is=20
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without=20
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the=
=20
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we=20
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.=
 =20
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS. =20
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S.=20
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books=
=20
into the system. =20
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in=20
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to=20
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the=20
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide=20
books need to be set up.

Thanks

JG
