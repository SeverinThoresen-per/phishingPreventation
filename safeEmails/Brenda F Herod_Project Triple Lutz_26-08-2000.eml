To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of th=
e=20
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been=20
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real=
=20
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is=
=20
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional=20
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job=
,=20
but we do need everyone thinking of "what if's."  Our risk books are complex=
,=20
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of=
=20
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the=20
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our=20
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our=20
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on=
=20
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1=
,=20
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure tha=
t=20
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the=20
Triple Lutz data room. =20

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am=20
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come u=
p=20
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @=20
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITAT=
E=20
TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!
