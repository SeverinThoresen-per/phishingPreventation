John-
I have been helping David Draper to review the NYSEG positions we currently =
have, and accurately reflect our exposure, based on LDC restrictions.  The o=
ne factor that I hope you can help with is the physical constraints in deliv=
ering gas to NYSEG off of certain pipes.  It appears as if most of our posit=
ion is based upon deliveries off CNG, which I don't believe has any physical=
 constraints.  However, we also have small positions requiring us to deliver=
 off of TCO, Iroquois and Algonquin.

Based on the pricing I see in RGS, there is obviously some issue with delive=
ring off of TCO in the winter.  I'm wondering if you can help explain this, =
as well as any other issues you are aware of here. =20

It's probably easiest to talk through it rather than e-mail about it, but I =
assumed you were trading.  You can call me at x35514 when you have some time=
=2E  (If David has already contacted you about this, let me know and you don=
't have to repeat yourself.)
