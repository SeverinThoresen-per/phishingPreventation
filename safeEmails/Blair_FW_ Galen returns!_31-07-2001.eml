FYI--I visited with Galen Friday pm and he is planning on returnning this Th=
ursday & Friday for a half day.  Next week, he will probably work half-days =
Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri.  Then we'll go from there!  His half-days will be ca=
tching the last bus from his area in the morning, and leaving on the first o=
ne back home.  He will be going down to the health center over lunch to rest=
=2E  Also, he's in a brace from his armpits to his hips which he says is ext=
remely hot.  We're ready to welcome him back, but go easy on him!
