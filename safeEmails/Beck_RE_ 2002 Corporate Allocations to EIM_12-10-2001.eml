The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee=
 members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed=
 acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI. =20

I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMaho=
n has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to =
Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has =
already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.  Kevin reduced his d=
irect costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says=
 that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conv=
ersation around that on Monday.  --Sally=20

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that=
 EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification=
 for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we =
have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasona=
ble charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination wa=
s based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected serv=
ices provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are a=
lso performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget pr=
esentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come =
to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges=
 before such meeting.
