Tanya,

This will confirm that you and my other clients have decided to go forward=20
with initiating arbitration in the above-referenced matter, despite the=20
up-front costs, and are comfortable with your own assessment of the risks of=
=20
Triad having no executable assets, as well your own view that from a policy=20
basis, this matter needs to go forward to make sure that other traders don't=
=20
try the same thing.

I will prepare an arbitration demand and submit it for the review of anyone=20
who needs to see it before it goes out.  It will be very short.  Please let=20
me know who (if anyone) would like to see a draft first.

Britt
