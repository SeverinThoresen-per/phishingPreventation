The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, =
interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a w=
oman.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door=
 and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions,=
 no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your w=
ife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I =
could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man =
for this job."

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went int=
o the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with te=
ars in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You d=
on't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to ki=
ll her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, o=
ne shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls.=
 After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood =
the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded =
with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.
