ICE Melts Resistance ToOil Swaps.

The oil hedging business is poised to take another step up the evolutionary =
ladder, after the upstart IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) confirmed plans to o=
ffer clearing services for its over-the-counter contracts from the fourth qu=
arter of this year. With similar moves also planned by the New York Mercanti=
le Exchange (Nymex), OTC contracts such as swaps are increasingly moving int=
o the mainstream. Long regarded as the wild cousins of regulated futures, OT=
C oil contracts were distinguished by their fuzzy legal status, lack of stan=
dardization, and absence of clearing services. Changes in USlaw and the spre=
ad of electronic trade have pretty much eroded the first two differences, an=
d the ICE initiative will deal with the third. The main differences now lie =
in regulation and settlement (40#02-06). ICE'sclearing services will be prov=
ided by the London Clearing House (LCH) - the clearinghouse for London's Int=
ernational Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which was taken over by ICE last month.=
 ICE will now be able to offer a one-stop hedging shop for cleared futures a=
nd derivative contracts, allowing traders to use a single location to conduc=
t full hedging strategies and to pool their risk. One advantage is that it w=
ill allow net margining between IPE Brent futures and other ICE products, su=
ch as West Texas Intermediate swaps. Clearinghouses offer financial risk pro=
tection, acting as a central party to shield traders against counterparty de=
fault. Derivatives trade at ICE is currently conducted between companies on =
the basis of bilateral credit agreements.=20
ICE'sinitiative in part reflects its increasingly fierce competition with Ny=
mex. The New Yorkexchange will this week launch its new Brent crude futures =
and options contracts, as a direct challenge to the merged ICE-IPE (40#35-04=
). In return, ICE will first introduce clearing services for two actively tr=
aded USproducts, involving West Texas Intermediate crude oil swaps and Henry=
 Hub natural gas swaps. These swaps are the planned centerpiece for Nymex'sl=
ong-delayed internet platform, eNymex(40#04-05). They also pose a potential =
challenge to Nymex'stwo core futures contracts, if trade migrates to swaps. =
Some traders view swaps as more effective hedging tools. Calendar-month WTI =
swaps, for example, are widely used to hedge against producer or refiner sup=
ply contracts, which use average prices during calendar rather than contract=
 months.=20
The evolution of swaps is also part of a deeper market trend, which has been=
 actively encouraged by the USgovernment and some big energy companies. The =
UShas been working to give derivatives a stronger legal framework since the =
late 1990s, after Russiadefaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital Mana=
gement hedge fund came to the brink of collapse. That effort culminated in l=
egislation late last year giving derivatives a stronger legal footing, thus =
eliminating the chance that parties might renege on unfavorable contracts by=
 claiming they were really unauthorized futures deals. The spread of electro=
nic trade - particularly on ICE - has accelerated the change, by encouraging=
 liquid trade in standardized products. This is no accident. In an interview=
 with PIW a year ago, John Browne, chief executive of BP - one of ICE'sfound=
ers - said that the platform had been set up in an attempt to create "a real=
 exchange market for swaps, rather than simply one-off, over-the-counter act=
ivity." This would make hedging more transparent and efficient, while erodin=
g the role of intermediaries, he said. Browne drew parallels with the earlie=
r evolution of interest-rate swaps in financial markets, into "a standardize=
d business." (39#27-08).Last week, ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprechersaid =
the exchange wants "to try to change the way the market works."
