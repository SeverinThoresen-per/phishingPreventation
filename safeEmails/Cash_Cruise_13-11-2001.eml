FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of=
 Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is=
 nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.

One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which =
can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your ped=
iatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some=
 meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing =
boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroi=
d).

Later, Michelle
