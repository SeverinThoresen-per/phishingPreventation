Here are the issues for HL&P for 11/99:

The shortage at San Jac meter 1554 (the 95%) cannot be made up at 7268=20
because not enough flow at the meters.  What can we do?  Buyback?
Adonis has nom of 10000mmbtu on day 4, should this be kept whole?   If so,=20
how?  Day 4 flowed of 153mmbtu at the aggregate meter.

Please advice. =20

Thanks
