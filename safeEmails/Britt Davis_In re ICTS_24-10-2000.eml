PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Nicole and Bob:

This will confirm our telephone conference today regarding the issue whether=
=20
Enron Metals should be sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the=20
various carriers who have tried to collect unpaid freight from Enron Metals=20
as a result of the reported insolvency of ICTS, Enron Metals' former shippin=
g=20
agent.

Bob advised that the carrier's claims he has received in the New York office=
=20
total in the neighborhood of $30,000-$35,000.  Of those, three carriers=20
apparently have claims of $5,400, $16,000 and $13,210.  With respect to thos=
e=20
three carriers, Bob's office has sent some type of letter indicating that=20
Enron Metals already paid ICTS for this shipment and that those carriers=20
should look to ICTS for payment.  The remaining claims are reportedly=20
relatively small (and Bob will be sending me his file containing those claim=
s=20
shortly).

Nicole advised that the claims she has received in the Montreal office total=
=20
in the neighborhood of $40,000.  Close to 90% of those reportedly involve=20
shipments that were completed prior to the end of April.  It is Nicole's=20
understanding that she and her office were still a part of Barclay's until=20
the end of April.  She is not, however, aware of how responsibility would=20
have been apportioned between Barclay's and MG Metals at the time for claims=
=20
such as these.  Nicole will shortly send me an e-mail which sets forth what=20
bills concern shipments that occurred after the end of April.  No notice of=20
contest letter of any kind has been sent to these carriers.

Both of you indicated that the telephone calls you had been receiving from=20
the carriers has tapered off.

Based on the foregoing, I recommended to you, and you agreed, that the best=20
strategy was to "let sleeping dogs lie"--i.e., not to attract attention to=20
Enron Metals by sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the various=
=20
carriers.  The risk here is that if one or more of these carriers does file=20
suit, you may not be able to assert any defense on behalf of MG Metals, such=
=20
as a late or inaccurate bill (and I have not researched your bills to=20
determine whether such defenses exist).  Should a carrier file suit, you=20
would probably be liable for the principle and interest, along with=20
attorneys' fees. =20

However, given our preliminary impression that MG Metals is secondarily=20
liable on these bills if ICTS defaults, and the relevatively small size of=20
most of these bills, I think a "reactive" rather than "proactive" defensive=20
strategy makes sense.=20

Nicole and I agreed that I would run down exactly how Barclay's and MG Metal=
s=20
decided to apportion liability for charges such as these at the time of that=
=20
transaction.  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Marcus if he knows the=20
right person to advise me on this (or if he has access to the relevant=20
documents).

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt =20
