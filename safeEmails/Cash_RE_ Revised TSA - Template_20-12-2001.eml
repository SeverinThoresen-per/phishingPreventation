in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it i=
s considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decis=
ion here though.=20

As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal=
 term. I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid templ=
ate or not. Let me know if you want me to check the latest version=20
