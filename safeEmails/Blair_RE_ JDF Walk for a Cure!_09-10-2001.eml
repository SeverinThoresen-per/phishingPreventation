Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October =
28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruit=
ing walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate =
to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask an=
yway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependen=
t diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every eff=
ort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and childre=
n!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it e=
ach time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot =
of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  =
It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars=
 are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to =
release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful inject=
ions. =20

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support =
to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I ho=
pe that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as=
 I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams=
 and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given t=
o each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in=
 your budget, you can purchase a "JDF Shoe" for only $5.00 and it will be po=
sted at the Big E Caf=E9 on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are=
 matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28t=
h!

Lisa Sawyer
