Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the=20
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father"=
=20
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind=
=20
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high=20
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't=20
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external=20
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to=
=20
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that=20
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen=20
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated=20
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory=20
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and=20
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it=20
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen=20
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of=20
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen=20
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and,=20
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to=20
help the Group.

Clayton
