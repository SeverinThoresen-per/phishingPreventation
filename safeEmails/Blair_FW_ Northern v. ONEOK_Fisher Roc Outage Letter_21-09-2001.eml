	Drew,

	Grant is putting the finishing touches on the proposed letter to ONEOK expl=
aining the Fisher Roc lock up period of September 12-16 and what we will do =
to resolve it.  Long and short, we are declaring that this is an "error in t=
he Inlet/Outlet meter formula", rather than a "Btu measurement error," becau=
se there was nothing wrong with Northern's chromatograph that caused this pr=
oblem.  Accordingly, we will not be using the Plant's PTR during the outage =
period, but rather a formula based on the ratio between the rich inlet and r=
ich outlet volumes for a period of time before and after the outage period, =
as per 2b.(iv) of the Measurement Agreement.

	I will circulate a draft of the letter to all by e-mail once I get it from =
Grant.  It is prepared for signature by Ken Cessac.

	Questions:
=09
	1.  Who with ETS needs to be on the copy list on this and any future letter=
s regarding measurement errors at Bushton?

	2.  Who at ONEOK (maybe more than one person?) should receive this letter?

	Many thanks for your input.

	Britt
