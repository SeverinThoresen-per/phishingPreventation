I think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because o=
ur annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.  Also, we usually =
use some other language.  I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention=
 letter.

ed to obtain employees' signatures on these contracts prior to payment.
