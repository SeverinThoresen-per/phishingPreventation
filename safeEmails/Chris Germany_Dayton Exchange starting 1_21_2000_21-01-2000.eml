This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000,=20
please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA=
=20
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The=
=20
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals=20
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or=20
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal. =20

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.
