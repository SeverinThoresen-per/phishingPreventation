The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with re=
gards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the d=
eadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-=20

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                           =
    To be forwarded to Louise      =20
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines an=
d detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possibl=
e. =20

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forwa=
rd to January 14, 2002.    =20
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                            =
    To be forwarded to Faith Killen=20
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can b=
e amortized)=20
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                       =
    Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate=20
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be livi=
ng on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we woul=
d look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuri=
ng around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence=20
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday =
and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on We=
dnesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco pe=
rsonnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a contin=
ual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsib=
ility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communi=
cation issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and =
what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of y=
ou on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate on=
ce we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good i=
dea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.=20

Happy New Year=20

Louise=20
