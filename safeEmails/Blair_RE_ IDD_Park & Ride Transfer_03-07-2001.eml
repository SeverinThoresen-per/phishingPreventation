I assumed Kaztex were nominating on the timely, but after our storage discus=
sions at today's Morning Meeting, I need to check.  I will instruct them to =
do so.  This should then clear up their accounts.=20

Thanks!

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not a=
ny NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Stor=
age on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get i=
njections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few da=
ys.

Sue

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kazte=
x for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to =
withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their ba=
lance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and =
the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held op=
en the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from =
the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on t=
he transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogd=
en and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a tran=
sport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nom=
inations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two poi=
nts without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this =
specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possi=
ble MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue b=
eing waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus =
720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up t=
his amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let =
me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.
