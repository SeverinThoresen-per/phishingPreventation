Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (deta=
ils please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many e=
Mails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced=
 web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages fr=
om leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  foru=
ms (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in w=
hich Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there =
may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discuss=
ion and research endeavors at the professorial level. =20
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for t=
he professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions amo=
ng the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and ot=
her research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for =
new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participati=
on on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on th=
e other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think=
-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRE=
CTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above=
 recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intenti=
onally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in deal=
ing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from =
information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, refere=
nces, course work, etc.=20

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in t=
his effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and=
 other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate-=
--they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of =
this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement=
-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, direc=
tly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into th=
is effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses t=
hink it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your =
senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed,=
 at least at this time,  simply as an "Enron brain drain" (I've received thi=
s realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one busines=
s person at Enron).  =20

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestl=
y to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortabl=
e telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in t=
he WeBI effort largely at the=20
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at o=
ther levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the "From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:
