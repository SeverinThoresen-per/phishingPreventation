Leaf -

I just received a call from payroll - they miscalculated your vacation payba=
ck.

Rather than the $1,113.66, you actually only owe $957.04 (they forgot to tak=
e away your OR state taxes in the first calculation).

Can you please write another check and we will void the first one?  Do you w=
ant the check returned to you?

Sorry for the inconvenience.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Amy
