Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back=20
to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking=20
forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'l=
l=20
see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that=20
weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready=
=20
for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).

Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale o=
f=20
HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready=20
to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi=
=20
decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San=20
Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has=20
wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like=20
that.

How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty=
=20
good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend=20
time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I=20
need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.

Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's=20
been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I=20
haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I=20
don't change my ways.
