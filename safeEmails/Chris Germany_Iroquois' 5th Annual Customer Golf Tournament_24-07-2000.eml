Hello

Watch your "snail mail" for your invitation to:

Iroquois' 5th Annual Customer Golf Tournament
Monday, August 21
8 am
Tower Ridge Country Club
Simsbury, CT

For a sneak peek (sorry, photos but no course map), visit their website
at http://www.towerridgecc.com/

If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact Robin Almond
at the phone number or e-mail address listed at the end of this message.

We look forward to seeing you on August 21.

-- Your friends at Iroquois.

PS - It has just come to my attention that there is a typo on the reply
page of the invitation - it says "I will/will not be attending Iroquois'
Canadian Golf Tournament".  Although the 5th and 6th holes are pretty
high up on Heublin Ridge, we haven't relocated the tournament to north
of the border, its still in Connecticut. My apologies.
