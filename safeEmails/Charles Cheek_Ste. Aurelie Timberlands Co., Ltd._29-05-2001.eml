I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process=20
upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel=
=2E=20
This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago,=
=20
whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process=20
relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states.=
=20
Currently, that agent is NRAI.=20

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies=20
requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific=20
business needs.=20

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned=20
company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific=20
business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone o=
n=20
your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company=20
is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.  =20
