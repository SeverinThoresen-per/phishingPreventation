I'm indifferent to the technicality of whether the $ is sent directly to AEP=
 or indirectly to AEP by returning the $$ to El Paso.....I  only wished to c=
larify that this mistaken post-petition payment is not property of the estat=
e.   bng

I think that is right.  So long as it is absolutely clear that the money was=
 paid in error, return the money to El Paso that was erroneously sent by El =
Paso to ENA.

I am sending a carbon copy of this to Barbara Gray to confirm that I am givi=
ng the correct advice.

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this. =
 Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for=
 purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King=
 Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP =
have called asking for their money.  Please advise.
