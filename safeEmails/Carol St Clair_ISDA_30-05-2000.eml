Russell:
I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that=20
the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be=20
signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with=
=20
resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer=20
Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything=20
would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement=20
and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what tha=
t=20
date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the=20
trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.
