many areas; global assets, EBS, and environmental come to mind very clearly.=
 =20
Her politeness, friendless, and actually openness,  indicate that she could=20

However, her abilities-clearly from the resume and from the way she explaine=

dealt with.  =20

I shall take the liberty to communicate with Amy again after she finishes he=

potential areas of contribution.
