Dear Vince,

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for
scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Susan
