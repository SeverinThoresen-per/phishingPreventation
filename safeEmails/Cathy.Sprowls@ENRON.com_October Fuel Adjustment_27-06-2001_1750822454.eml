The $133,546 open item related to fuel is for an increase of 24,954 MMBTUs t=
o ANR Pipeline.=20

There was a fuel adjustment in March reducing fuel by 24,985 and reducing ex=
pense $132,800.  That revenue that was taken to the desk in April.  That fue=
l adjustment was reversed in a subsequent month, and that is the $133,546 ex=
pense that is on the back page currently.  I have copies of the VMREP007 rep=
orts as support.  Let me know if I need to get anything additional from Volu=
me Management.

Thanks
Cathy
