Whenever we asked to give terminated information for the Estate we should in=
clude the 'Alberta ENA Bankruptcy' portfolio.  The transactions in this port=
folio are transactions entered into by Canada using a ENA contract that has =
now been terminated.

If you have specific questions, please contact Kathy Reeves.
