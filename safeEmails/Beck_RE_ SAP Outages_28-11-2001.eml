Yes, I think that it makes sense to keep the system available over the weeke=
nd for the foreseeable future.  I had operations teams accessing critical da=
ta, available only in SAP, on Friday evening and Sunday this past weekend.  =
It is very likely that our need to do so will continue, unlimited to weekday=
s.  Thanks.  --Sally=20

Normally, these scheduled SAP outages are planned with the major user bases =
via a communication released 3 weeks in advance and subsequently approved.  =
The notice you received today was a reminder notice.  This outage is due to =
our quarterly production build schedule for SAP upgrades to the HR environme=
nt ("hotpacks"). =20

We rescheduled this weekends outage earlier today after consultation with HR=
 and the tentative and future date will be mid-January.  At this point no ad=
ditional outages are planned for the remainder of the year.

The revised (cancelled) notification will go out tomorrow.
