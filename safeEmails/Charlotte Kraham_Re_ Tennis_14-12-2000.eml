Hey Elizabeth.

Well I'm not sure when we will be able to make up the game.  I was out of=20
town last week and am in St Louis as I write this to you.  I will be here=20
till Friday and then back again on Sunday night until the end of the week.  =
I=20
saw Dan yesterday during lunch and he reminded me of it too... he knows my=20
situation so I think he will understand if we end up not playing until the=20
new year.  I wish we could play it before then but it doesn't look like my=20
schedule will accomodate it... I am also leaving for NY on the 25th for Xmas=
=20
with Bryan's family till the 2nd. =20

Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thanks for getting in contact=20
with me... I am in way over my head not only with snow tonight :) but with=20
work and school. =20

Are you going out of town for Xmas? =20

Don't practice too much... I haven't played in weeks so I am back to square=20
one... I think Dan might have to show me what a racket looks like again!!!!!

Take care and I will keep you up to date on what's happening with my schedul=
e=20
and when we can get together.

Char

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and ga=
s=20
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering th=
e=20
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the=20
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less=20
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable)=20
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya
