Cecilia,
In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move o=
nly financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SO=
CAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take? =
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.
