Gas Control we need to call  Mid Am by around 5:45 P.M. (Intra day 2 process=
) to see what their intention are on Quad Cities and Cedar Rapids points if =
they are outside their 20,000 plus 5% of their order. ETS scheduler should c=
all you around this time to see if we need to allocate them based on the inf=
ormation they have given you. Also be sure and log this conversation.
