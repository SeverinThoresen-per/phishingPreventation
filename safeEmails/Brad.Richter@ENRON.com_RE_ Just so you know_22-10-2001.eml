John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. Jo=
hn was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on=
 this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bea=
ring in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mar=
k address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issu=
e since 1999.
