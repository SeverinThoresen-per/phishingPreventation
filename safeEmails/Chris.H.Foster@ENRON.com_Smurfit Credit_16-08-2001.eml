I told Ron that our gas deal was with Smurfit Stone as are our Montanan Powe=
r deal and the L/C.  Ron indicated that Smurfit Stone cannot enter into thes=
e types of transactions.  Can you please help me by contacting the appropria=
te individuals at Smurfit   and try to clarify the credit picture.

Thanks

Chris
