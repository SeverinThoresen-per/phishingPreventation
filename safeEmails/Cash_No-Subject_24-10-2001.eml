Fraser, what do you think?



You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions=
 relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance. =20

The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements is as follows=
:

	"Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee =
is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual=
 performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in questi=
on, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, =
2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be bas=
ed on an annual bonus target of $_____________."

This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's p=
eers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires t=
hat a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3=
 rating categories (i.e., 1,2,3, distributed as 10-80-10), the only the peop=
le in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria=
=2E

This result, however, would limit significantly the number of persons who ar=
e eligible to be paid the target bonus.  As a result, I would suggest that t=
he middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e.=
, 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A woul=
d be eligible for the target bonus.
