Mr. Lay,

I wanted to send you a short note and let you know that I am behind you, and=
 I am remaining focused on the job ahead.

I also wanted to thank you for your candidness in answering questions and pr=
oviding information during the All-Employee Meeting on Tuesday.  As you and =
the management team work through the issues, that we as a company face, I wi=
ll be praying for you and the team that God will give you the strength to st=
and firm on the integrity that has made this company what it is today.

"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed =
by their duplicity." Proverbs 11:3

Sincerely,
Chad Corbitt
