Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time t=
o get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard =
copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page for=
mat, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I =
tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer. =20

Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I h=
ave been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeti=
ng was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting req=
uired a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with y=
ou at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen. =20

How are your 5:00 pm meetings? =20

I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally=20


Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!
