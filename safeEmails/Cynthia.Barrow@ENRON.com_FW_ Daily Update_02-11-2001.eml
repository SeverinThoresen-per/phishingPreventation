You and all of Enron are in our prayers.  If I can I'd like to share a verse=
 that found its way to me during my morning prayer time.  I hope it blesses =
you as well.

Psalm 121 (1-3)  I lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help come from=
?  My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.  He will not =
let my foot slip. =20

I have prayed that God will stay close to your side and let you know that hi=
s works are most powerful when we need him the most.

God Bless
Cb

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain sha=
reholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help mainta=
in our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking pa=
rtners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Sa=
lomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will=
 provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Nort=
hern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support thes=
e assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and =
to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this=
 new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way t=
o increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to i=
ncrease this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additiona=
l banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed =
last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billio=
n in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our comp=
any.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Ch=
ronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/edi=
torial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone a=
nd I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these de=
velopments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/upd=
ates/>).

Thank you.
