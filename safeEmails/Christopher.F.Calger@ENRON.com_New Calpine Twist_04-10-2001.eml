It's getting strange...

Calpine wants to see our offer:

Big Prepay - $200MM - $300MM
EPMI Sells 200MW+ 7x24=20
DP: NP-15 or SP-15
Price: $61=20
Start: 7/02
Term: 5-10 years

Rationale: They have $61 DWR contracts.  At this point the DWR contracts are=
 tied to their accrual generation business.  If we pay them for the right to=
 sell $61's, they can get the cash and recognize the earnings. =20

Like the rest of this story, selling to a generator sounds strange.  However=
, if the forward market is trading below their stated price forecast, they m=
ay want to buy, not sell. =20

Perhaps we go down a parallel path: bids in the East, offers in the west. =20

Maybe we end up in a seller-financing deal: loan $ for investment in New Pow=
er and purchase of sites, equipment, ERC's. =20

Dave and I are available to compare notes and discuss strategy.

Regards,
