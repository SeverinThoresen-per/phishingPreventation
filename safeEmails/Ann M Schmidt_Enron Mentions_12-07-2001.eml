Enron Says 2nd-Qtr Net Income Rose 40% to $404 Mln (Update2)
2001-07-12 08:38 (New York)

Enron Says 2nd-Qtr Net Income Rose 40% to $404 Mln (Update2)

     (Adds analyst's comment in eighth paragraph.)

     Houston, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the top energy
trader, said second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as higher sales
of electricity more than made up for a loss in its
telecommunications business.
     Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a share, from
$289 million, or 34 cents, in the year-earlier period, Enron said.
The Houston-based company was expected to make 42 cents a share,
the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
     Energy traders such as Enron benefited from rising
electricity prices in the U.S. West. Efforts to lower prices in
California and other western states didn't succeed until late in
the quarter.
     Revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion from $16.9 billion in
the quarter. Most of that came from Enron's Wholesale Services
business, which includes electricity trading and development of
energy projects such as power plants.
     Enron had first-half revenue of $100.2 billion, almost equal
its revenue for all of last year. Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling
has predicted revenue will top $200 billion this year.

                         Broadband Losses

     Enron's broadband business, which trades space on fiber-optic
networks, had a loss before interest, minority interests and taxes
of $102 million, compared to an $8 million loss in the year-
earlier period.
     The company is firing broadband staff to reduce costs,
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. She declined to say how many people
would be fired or where the cuts would take place. Enron has
broadband staff in Houston, London, Singapore and Portland,
Oregon. Denne said Enron would try to find internal jobs for the
broadband workers and only cut those employees it can't place.
     ``Overall results were impressive in light of the losses in
broadband services,'' said First Albany analyst Bob Christensen,
who rates Enron a ``strong buy.'' ``It looks like they have
already begun to address the losses in broadband and I expect
those will decline.''
     Skilling has transformed a natural gas-pipeline company into
the biggest competitor in the business of trading commodities such
as gas and power. Enron also uses financial instruments such as
futures contracts to help protect customers from swings in energy
prices.
     In places including California, the company has a growing
business in contracts that manage energy supply for big customers
such as Owens-Illinois Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co. Contracts
increased 89 percent to $7.2 billion in the quarter, Enron said.
     Earnings were released before the market opened. Shares of
Enron fell 12 cents to $49.10 yesterday. They have fallen
41 percent this year.

Energy Commission Divides Control of Eastern Power Grid
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 2, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered yesterday that the=20
electricity transmission grid for the eastern United States be put under=20
control of two regional authorities. One group would oversee New England and=
=20
the Middle Atlantic states, and the other would be responsible for the=20
Southeast.=20
The move, which reflects the influence of two new appointees by President=20
Bush, was considered a victory for competitive energy suppliers like Enron=20
and a setback for some utilities that had sought to keep more local control=20
of transmission lines.
Energy regulators also strongly signaled that they were considering a simila=
r=20
approach for both the Midwest and the West.=20
With the deregulation of the nation's electricity business, federal=20
regulators have been struggling to determine who should have control of=20
transmission lines and how to ensure that the grid is operated in a way that=
=20
allows all sellers of electricity fair access and guarantees that enough=20
money is spent to keep things working properly.=20
In 1999, the commission told transmission owners to form regional authoritie=
s=20
that would oversee different parts of the country. Utilities and other owner=
s=20
had made numerous proposals, including more than a half-dozen just in the=20
Eastern United States.=20
But yesterday, the commission ordered those plans consolidated into two larg=
e=20
authorities, a move the agency said was needed to ''establish efficient=20
markets in the Northeast'' and to ''successfully encompass the natural marke=
t=20
for bulk power in the Southeast.''=20
The commission ordered mediators to take charge of negotiations to create=20
both authorities and report back in two months. Some industry officials said=
=20
they hoped the commission's apparent desire to speed up the process would=20
also ease concerns that badly needed transmission investments had been=20
delayed while issues over control of the grid were sorted out.=20
Competitive sellers of electricity have long sought a more centralized=20
control of transmission. They say this would help eliminate efforts by=20
utilities with longstanding monopoly territories to impede others from doing=
=20
business in their home regions. Some utilities, however, like the Southern=20
Company, based in Atlanta, have generally favored more localized control of=20
transmission.=20
Steve Kean, an executive vice president at Enron, which is based in Houston,=
=20
said the ruling was a ''giant step'' that would help end ''rampant=20
discrimination'' by transmission owners against companies that needed access=
=20
to the grid to sell electricity.=20
''There is an awful lot of administrative bottlenecks and nonsense that goes=
=20
on, not posting accurate numbers on available capacity, not scheduling=20
transactions, a lot of bunk going on,'' Mr. Kean said. ''You're going to=20
eliminate a lot of that.''=20
A spokeswoman for Southern declined comment, saying company officials needed=
=20
time to digest the order. At that time, officials ''will need to evaluate ou=
r=20
options,'' she said.=20
A spokeswoman for New England's independent system operator, which had sough=
t=20
to form its own regional authority, said her agency was disappointed. A=20
spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, which had also sough=
t=20
to form its own authority, said it needed more time to study the order.=20
While most of the five-member agency endorsed the plan, one commissioner,=20
Linda Breathitt, said in an interview that the decision was a ''dramatic=20
departure'' that turns a ''voluntary approach into almost a mandate.'' She=20
cited the influence of the commission's two newest members, Patrick H. Wood=20
III and Nora Brownell, who were appointed this year by President Bush.

SACRAMENTO -- Acting five hours after Enron Corp. sued to stop a legislative=
=20
investigation of its business practices, a state Senate committee Wednesday=20
gave the electricity wholesaler a second chance to turn over documents and=20
rid itself of a contempt citation.=20
But officials at Enron, a major player in the California power market,=20
brushed aside the gesture, saying it fell far short of meeting the company's=
=20
objections.
"Our position has not changed. . . . The issues we had at the beginning of=20
the hearing, we still had at the conclusion of the hearing," spokeswoman=20
Karen Denne said.=20
The Houston-based electricity wholesaler claimed in a letter to the Senate=20
investigative committee that it was being singled out as a "political=20
scapegoat" for the energy mistakes of California officials.=20
In the suit, Enron charged that the committee's investigation went far=20
outside the law, an allegation denied by Chairman Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana). He=
=20
also denied the scapegoat charge.=20
The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court 62 minutes before the select=20
committee investigating market manipulation was to finalize its earlier=20
finding of contempt against Enron.=20
Enron appears to be the last of eight power sellers to refuse to make=20
documents available to the committee. Seven others also had held out, but in=
=20
the last two weeks have said they will provide the records or are negotiatin=
g=20
to do so.=20
Dunn said the committee must examine the hundreds of thousands of documents,=
=20
including what Enron called its "most closely guarded secrets," to determine=
=20
whether price gouging occurred and whether remedial legislation is necessary=
=2E=20
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials are convinced that the wholesalers=20
overcharged the state $8.9 billion during the energy crisis. A federal=20
mediator has said the overcharges are closer to $1 billion.=20
But at Wednesday's hearing, an angry Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), a sponso=
r=20
of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law, charged that by suing the=20
committee, Enron was trying to "precipitate a constitutional crisis" between=
=20
the judicial and legislative branches of state government.=20
"You just went to war with the state of California and the people of=20
California!" Peace shouted at Michael Kirby, a San Diego attorney=20
representing Enron. "You are already at war economically. Now you are at war=
=20
politically."=20
Kirby replied that Enron was merely trying to defend its right to due proces=
s=20
against what he called unlawful violations by the committee.=20
He complained that Enron was held in contempt on June 28 but that the compan=
y=20
had never been given a chance to present its objections.=20
"An accused criminal has been given more opportunity to have a hearing on=20
their objections than I have [in this committee]," Kirby told the lawmakers.=
=20
Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), also an attorney, told Kirby that=20
legislative subpoenas are far different than those issued in the court syste=
m=20
and are not subject to the same restrictions because lawmakers must deal wit=
h=20
policy issues, not matters of guilt or innocence.=20
In their suit and testimony to the committee, Enron representatives charged=20
the committee had ventured far out of its jurisdiction and that only the=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could legally undertake a wholesale=20
price investigation and impose sanctions.=20
The committee asked for a vast array of documents, including those involving=
=20
business decisions and transactions in other states. But Enron claimed that=20
the committee had no authority to issue subpoenas outside California and tha=
t=20
the subpoenas themselves were flawed.=20
The company asked the court for an injunction against further investigation=20
by the committee and proposed that a "neutral" arbitrator or judge try to=20
fashion a compromise.=20
Dunn suggested that the lawsuit was an effort to intimidate the committee.=20
But he insisted it "will not impact our investigation."=20
Under contempt procedures, last used in 1929, the committee can find an=20
individual or entity in contempt. It then reports its recommendations to the=
=20
full Senate, which must ratify the committee's action. The Senate also can=20
impose sanctions, ranging from possible jail terms to heavy penalties.=20
Dunn offered Enron what he called a "middle ground" that would give the=20
company an opportunity to change its mind and comply with the subpoenas=20
instead of facing an immediate report to the Senate.=20
Under Dunn's recommendation, approved on a bipartisan 5-0 vote, the report o=
f=20
Enron's failure to comply would be compiled and written, but it would not be=
=20
delivered to the full Senate until Monday at the earliest.=20
If Enron were to reverse itself and agree to provide the records the=20
committee wants, sign a confidentiality agreement and create a Sacramento=20
repository for its records, the committee would hold the report back.=20
If compliance continued, Dunn said, the committee's contempt finding would b=
e=20
purged.=20
Dunn said he decided to give Enron a second chance because his "No. 1=20
priority is to get the documents. Contempt is the last resort."=20
Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company recently established a=20
document repository in Sacramento for records of its California operations,=20
but not the disputed documents involving business elsewhere.=20
She contended that the confidentiality agreements proposed by the committee=20
failed to "guarantee that these documents would remain confidential."=20
Another wholesaler, Mirant, also had been held in contempt by the committee.=
=20
But Dunn said that since its June 28 citation, Mirant had become cooperative=
=2E=20
The committee agreed to review Mirant's citation in a month and possibly=20

SACRAMENTO, Calif.--A Texas-based power company moved to thwart an=20
investigation of alleged price gouging in the electric industry by taking it=
s=20
case Wednesday from the Capitol to the courthouse.=20
The legal action prompted angry lawmakers to accused Enron Corp. of=20
escalating its dispute with the state.
"You just went to war with the state of California," a seething state Sen.=20
Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, told Enron's attorney at a hearing.=20
Enron's lawsuit forced the legislative investigation of alleged price gougin=
g=20
into uncertain territory with some legal experts predicting that the issue=20
might have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.=20
The lawsuit was the latest salvo in an ongoing political and economic battle=
=20
over billions of dollars companies such as Enron have made during the energy=
=20
crisis.=20
Enron filed its lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court an hour before its=20
attorney was scheduled to appear before a Senate committee that two weeks ag=
o=20
declared them in contempt for refusing to turn over thousands of pages of=20
documents.=20
The power company argued in its lawsuit that the committee had no authority=20
to subpoena out-of-state records or examine highly confidential trade=20
secrets. Lawyers also argued that the Legislature was treading on federal=20
oversight powers.=20
In a letter to committee chairman Joe Dunn, an Enron executive suggested the=
=20
probe had unfairly singled out his company for villification.=20
"It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the committee's actions are=20
designed to uncover the facts underlying the price spikes in California's=20
wholesale electric power market, or to create a convenient political=20
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for California's policy mistakes," wrote=20
Steven J. Kean, Enron's executive vice president.=20
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, suggested Enron was trying to undermine his investigation=
=20
and spark a constitutional crisis by asking the courts to overrule the=20
Legislature.=20
"This first step into the litigation arena may be the first of many in an=20
effort to intimidate us out of completing the investigation," said Dunn.=20
"This raises the stakes dramatically."=20
A few hours after Enron filed the suit, Dunn and his committee unanimously=20
reaffirmed a contempt finding and voted to send a report to the full Senate=20
next week. At that point, the Senate would have broad authority to decide ho=
w=20
to penalize Enron. It could vote to throw company executives in jail, as the=
=20
Senate did in 1929 during a price fixing investigation of the cement=20
industry. It could vote to fine Enron for failing to turn over papers. Or it=
=20
could decide on some other penalty.=20
But Dunn and the other lawmakers gave Enron another chance to rethink their=20
position and turn over the kinds of documents other companies have given to=20
the committee.=20
So far, a half dozen other companies have managed to avoid similar threats b=
y=20
turning over, or agreeing to turn over, thousands of pages of confidential=20
papers.=20
On Wednesday, the committee withdrew a contempt finding against Mirant, whic=

WASHINGTON -- Tune into television news shows this week and you may catch a=20
commercial from something called the 21st Century Energy Project, promoting=20
President Bush's energy policies. The ad is new -- but if it looks and sound=
s=20
familiar, it should.=20
The peppy background music and footage of beaming faces have been lifted=20
directly from Mr. Bush's presidential-campaign films. Former Bush campaign=20
aides raised the money for the project, wrote the commercials and booked the=
=20
ads on CNN and affiliates of ABC and Fox News. Many of the conservative=20
donors behind the ads talk regularly with the president's top political=20
adviser, Karl Rove.
To advocates of campaign-finance reform, the ad is the latest example of wha=
t=20
they see as an outrage to be stamped out: A supposedly independent group=20
seems to be doing a politician's bidding -- in this case, the president's --=
=20
despite laws intended to prohibit such coordination.=20
Yet both campaign-finance measures being considered by the House likely will=
=20
lead to a proliferation of similar ads, which are much harder to regulate an=
d=20
to identify their sponsors under current laws than are traditional=20
politician- and party-sponsored ads.=20
The House will vote today on the Shays-Meehan legislation, companion to the=20
Senate-passed McCain-Feingold bill. It would drastically limit the=20
now-unlimited "soft money" contributions to political parties that are among=
=20
the largest sources of funding for political ads, and try to strengthen the=20
separation between politicians and interest groups. Though Mr. Bush doesn't=20
favor the House or Senate bill, he is widely expected to sign into law=20
whatever legislation Congress agrees on, given the political momentum behind=
=20
the issue.=20
Jan Baran, a former Republican Party lawyer who opposes campaign-finance=20
reform, argues that the half-billion dollars in soft money that flooded the=20
system during the 2000 election cycle won't simply vanish from future=20
campaigns. Instead, he says, much of it will reappear in special-interest=20
groups' campaigns such as the 21st Century Energy Project, which are much=20
harder, if not impossible, to control.=20
"There's an undeniable truth: There will be more money spent in the next=20
election than the last election," says Mr. Baran, who represents the U.S.=20
Chamber of Commerce and several other interest groups. But, he adds, "In the=
=20
future, the money will be diverted around the regulatory system." In that=20
way, parties could steer donors to supportive outside groups, who in turn=20
would run the same political ads that the parties or their candidates might=20
have run, had they been able to raise the money legally.=20
"You will see more of these ads," says Larry Noble, a former general counsel=
=20
to the Federal Election Commission who is executive director of the=20
campaign-finance watchdog group Center of Responsive Politics. "But the tota=
l=20
extent is not clear."=20
To be sure, some contributions will dry up; some Fortune 500 companies, for=20
example, are likely to happily withhold the big checks they feel compelled t=
o=20
write to grab politicians' attention. Many reform advocates say they will be=
=20
satisfied to flush some of the money out of the system, even if some lesser=20
portion is funneled back through other, outside conduits.=20
"There's bound to be some movement of money if you block off one channel,"=20
says Thomas Mann, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution. But he=20
adds, "I think it's a great myth" that all of the soft money will trickle to=
=20
outside organizations.=20
The McCain-Feingold bill tries to weaken the quasi-independent groups by=20
restricting their political activities in the final days of primary and=20
general-election campaigns. It also would instruct the FEC to better define=20
what constitutes illegal coordination between politicians and outside groups=
,=20
as a way to prevent politicians from surreptitiously working hand in hand=20
with special interests.=20
House GOP leaders are promoting an alternative measure that would require=20
such groups to report their existence and the identity of their treasurer,=20
but not the identity of their donors. Even if the McCain-Feingold bill=20
becomes law, corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals still will b=
e=20
free to contribute unlimited soft money to outside groups, and secretly.=20
Under a more-limited law enacted last year, some outside groups are required=
=20
to report their big-dollar donors periodically. Clever election-law experts=20
already have been counseling their clients among lobbying groups to create=20
quasipolitical organizations or for-profit corporations if they want to hide=
=20
the identity of their financiers.=20
The 21st Century Energy Project is a perfect illustration of how outside=20
groups can run ads to boost politicians and their agendas, yet stay within=20
federal election laws that prohibit explicit coordination.=20
Mr. Bush mostly has shied away from taking swipes at Democrats on energy=20
issues. Mindful of the polls, he is talking more about energy conservation,=20
which Americans favor, than his proposals for increasing energy production,=20
which are more controversial. Instead of speaking with a backdrop of, say, a=
n=20
idle oil rig, he is talking about dimming the lights in the Oval Office.=20
But, he still wants to sell the country on his market-based, pro-production=20
energy plan. So Republicans, led by GOP lobbyist and former Bush campaign=20
strategist Ed Gillespie, have enlisted energy companies and a Who's Who of=20
the conservative movement to bankroll a campaign of public support for=20
increasing production to avoid an energy shortfall. The image they want to=20
conjure? Think former President Carter's energy crisis, and a return to the=20
'70s-era lines at the local gas pump.=20
As a former communications adviser to Mr. Bush, Mr. Gillespie knows as well=20
as anyone what kind of message the administration would find helpful. Yet he=
=20
says the White House has played no role in his campaign. "I told some people=
=20
over there what I was up to, as a courtesy, because I did not want to=20
blindside them with the ads," he says. "The entire debate has been driven=20
from the left. There needs to be a conservative counterpoint."=20
Mr. Gillespie paid $75,000 for this week's ads, and hopes to pull together=20
about $500,000 more for future spots. Contributors include conservative=20
groups such as Citizens for Sound Economy, the American Conservative Union=20
and Americans for Tax Reform. The group isn't required to disclose its=20

nothing to do with the commercials.=20
The ads were written and placed by media strategist Russ Schriefer, who also=

speculators who are willing to take a gamble on making profits from this=20
uncertainty.=20
One of the main reasons for doubts about coal as a commodity is that it has=20
little history of wide price fluctuations, a key ingredient in bringing=20
together buyers and sellers. And of the roughly 1 billion tons of coal burne=

in the United States annually, 80 percent is bought through long-term=20

Skeptics also contend that the exchange is overestimating the industry's nee=

But those assumptions were under assault as Nymex's Central Appalachian=20

The price of coal per ton doubled in a matter of weeks last winter in some=20

"Welcome to the free market," he said. "The pace of deregulation will=20
encourage more and more activity on the exchange. At least that's the hope."=
=20
The swapping of coal contracts is not entirely new.=20
Energy traders, including Mirant, Enron Corp. and Aquila Inc., helped build=20
an international over-the-counter exchange on which some 1 million tons of=20
coal can switch hands on any given day. Some days, not a single transaction=20
takes place.=20
Just how much daily volume Nymex coal futures will add to the mix is=20
anybody's guess.=20
Nymex Executive Vice President Neal Wolkoff said, "If it starts in the low=20

viewed as a successful marketplace.=20
"We don't expect this to approach anywhere near the size of natural gas and=20

At the very least, Wolkoff said, the Nymex coal futures will benefit the=20

But critics believe Nymex's coal futures will suffer the same low trading=20

COPENHAGEN -(Dow Jones)- Vestas Wind Systems A/S (K.VWS), the world's larges=

clean energy.=20
Chief executive officer Johannes Poulsen told Dow Jones Newswires this=20
weekthat worldwide demand for turbines will outstrip the company's present=20
capacity in 2003.
As a result, Vestas is poised to expand production. It plans to do this=20
organically through the construction of new plants and the expansion of=20
existing ones, rather than through acquisitions, he said.=20
"We need more capacity as far as we can see with our forecasts," he said. "W=

feel it's easier to grow organically than by acquisitions and probably also =
a=20
more natural solution, when the growth is caused by industry growth."=20
In line with earlier predications, Vestas estimates that sales for 2003 will=
=20
be around 14 billion kroner ($1=3DDKK8.7126), more than double the DKK6.5=20
billion the company pulled in last year.=20
"We need to increase capacity for that," Poulsen said. "But we have not=20
decided where it will be."=20
The U.S. is a near-certain target. Poulsen said Vestas is planning to build=20
production facilities there. The company currently has a sales and service=20
force of about 120 for importing turbines in the U.S., but no manufacturing=20
capability there.=20
"We are preparing ourselves for production investments in the U.S.," Poulsen=
=20
said, declining to give details. "The extension of the tax credits will be=20
the trigger."=20
The U.S. production tax credit for power from renewable sources is set to=20
expire at year's end, but President George W. Bush has asked Congress to=20
renew it. That is expected to happen later this year. Confident Of=20
Maintaining Market Share=20

Getting production to meet demand is tough, particularly when demand=20
increases between 30% to 35% annually, according to the European Wind Energy=
=20
Association.=20
NEG Micon A/S (K.NEG), Vestas' chief Danish rival and the world's second=20
largest maker of turbines, nearly went under a couple of years ago, when the=
=20
pressure to produce was exacerbated by problems with its gear box.=20
But Vestas has proven it's more than just a weather vane blown about by gust=
s=20
of demand. It's built up a reputation as a company able to deliver a quality=
=20
product on demand.=20
That performance has sent its stock price rocketing more than tenfold since=20
it's initial public offering. At 1125 GMT, the share was trading at DKK380,=20
compared with a mere DKK29.80 where it closed on its first day of trading=20
Nov. 5, 1998.=20
Despite the sector's furious growth rate, the Danish company is confident it=
=20
can hold onto its 32% share of the world wind turbine market, which includes=
=20
the market share of Spain's Gamesa Energia, of which Vestas holds 40%.=20
"We expect to be able to maintain our market share in this fascinating,=20
growing industry by being in the markets where things are happening and bein=
g=20
able to expand our capacity when needed," Poulsen said.=20
Already the company has taken big steps to meet the rising demand in Europe,=
=20
which will require 60,000 megawatts of capacity by 2010 if the growth rate=20
continues at its present level, the EWEA estimates.=20
Last month, Vestas said it would set up fully owned production facilities in=
=20
Scotland, while in May it said it would build a blade plant in Germany.=20
"Those are capacity expansions in countries where the market is supposed to=20
be," and will carry the company through 2002, Poulsen said.=20
Helping fuel demand is the European Parliament's directive on renewable=20
energy, approved earlier this month, that allows member countries to proceed=
=20
with their incentive schemes for encouraging wind power and requires grid=20
operators to accept power from wind producers.=20
Industry experts say the directive will reassure investors that wind energy=20
isn't a speculative venture of long-haired environmentalists but a long-term=
=20
energy solution.=20
Already there's a "decent framework" in place in Denmark, Germany, France,=20
Spain and Italy, said Poulsen, who predicts the wind turbine manufacturing=20
industry will be dominated by four to six producers.=20
"The existing players have the capacity to maintain their positions in the=20
industry," he said.=20
According to the EWEA, the top suppliers are Vestas and Gamesa, Micon,=20

FERC Raises Uncertainty for Midwest Power Grid Operators
By Jon Kamp

Dow Jones Newswires=20
CHICAGO -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's apparent plans for the=
=20
future of the country's power grid throw into question a recent settlement=20
regarding control of the grid in the Midwest.
Although the commission didn't order any changes in the Midwest, its=20
indication Wednesday that it wants a single independent operator to run the=20
grid in each of four regions appears to contradict arrangements in the=20
country's midsection, where two grid operators plan to share control.=20
"Our main concern right now is the uncertainty that is going to pervade=20
things," said a senior Washington industry official familiar with the=20
situation.=20
The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc. and the Alliance=20
RTO -- which together would control the flow of power from the Great Plains=20
to Virginia -- this spring struck a deal under which they would offer a=20
single transmission rate to members of either group.=20
The Midwest ISO said it doesn't expect major changes to arrangement as a=20
result of FERC's actions. FERC itself in May approved the grid operators'=20
joint-operating settlement, and the commission indicated Wednesday the=20
settlement still had its unanimous support, Midwest ISO spokeswoman Mary Lyn=
n=20
Webster said.=20
"Yes, there are two [operators] in the Midwest, but they act as one," she=20
said. "We have no reason to believe that the FERC is asking us to do anythin=
g=20
in the Midwest."=20
In draft orders Wednesday, FERC said transmission owners in the Northeast an=
d=20
Southeast need to form one large grid operator for each region. FERC also=20
said it would consider ordering parties in the Midwest and West to enter=20
talks to move in a similar direction.=20
The steps were a big move for FERC, which has been criticized by some for=20
moving too slowly to put the country's power grids in independent hands.=20
Recently seated Bush-administration appointees have shifted the balance of=20
power on the commission to favor supporters of more aggressive action.=20
"We're moving ahead sharply," said Commissioner William Massey, backed by ne=
w=20
arrivals Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania. Mr. Massey=20
lauded the commission's "new resolve" to forge a handful of large grid=20
operators nationally.=20
Power marketing companies like Enron Corp. (ENE) and Mirant Corp. (MIR),=20
which have long pressed FERC to take a more active role to reduce utility=20
control over transmission access and trim back multiple transmission charges=
,=20
immediately voiced strong support for FERC's moves.=20
Steve Kean, an executive vice president at Enron, said the company would lik=
e=20
to see FERC's plan for single regional transmission organizations extend=20
beyond the Northeast and Southeast to areas like the Midwest.=20
"I hope the commission is going to extend this process to the rest of the=20

The Washington official, however, said the new FERC orders could threaten th=

Enron Sues California Senate; Panel Urges Contempt (Update4)

Enron Sues California Senate; Panel Urges Contempt (Update4)

     (Adds Enron's document repository in sixth paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, July 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
the world's largest energy trader, sued a California state Senate
committee to quash a subpoena for documents and accused the panel
of trying to scapegoat the company for the state's power woes.
     The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation
in the Wholesale Energy Market responded by voting for a second
time to recommend the full state Senate hold Enron in contempt.
The company may face fines or other punishment if it refuses to
turn over the documents. The vote was 6-0.
     Enron is fighting a committee subpoena issued last month
demanding thousands of pages of documents relating to energy
trading in California. The panel is probing whether generators
manipulated the power market. Soaring wholesale prices last year
left utilities unable to buy power, and the state began purchasing
energy on their behalf.
     ``It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the
committee's actions are designed to uncover the facts underlying
the price spikes in California's wholesale market, or to create a
convenient political scapegoat,'' Enron Executive Vice President
Steven Kean wrote in a letter to the committee.
     The full Senate won't receive the committee's recommendation
until next week, giving Enron time to turn over the documents,
said Committee Chairman Senator Joseph Dunn, a Democrat.
     ``The next move is now up to Enron,'' Dunn said.
     Enron has rented a document repository in Sacramento, and is
assembling documents to turn over, said Michael Kirby, an attorney
who represented Enron during today's hearing.
     The company and Dunn's committee first must come to an
agreement on confidentiality, he said. Houston-based Enron has
offered about 25,000 pages of documents, Special Counsel to the
Committee Larry Drivon said.

                        The Lawsuit

     Enron's suit, filed in Sacramento Superior Court, claims that
federal regulators have sole jurisdiction over wholesale-energy
trading and that the Senate subpoena is too broad, according to a
copy of the suit released by Enron. Enron also accused the
committee of singling it out for blame when dozens of companies
sold power to the state.
     The committee has subpoenaed almost 20 companies and
agencies, including generators and the state's largest investor-
owned and municipal utilities. The subpoenas were originally
blocked by a separate state Senate committee, which criticized
them for being overly broad.
     The subpoenas were altered and then approved. They ask for
more than 70 separate items, including documents tracking all
power sales in California, e-mails, phone logs, records of any
``trading strategies'' and financial records.
     The committee voted last month to hold Enron and Mirant Corp.
in contempt if they failed to turn over the documents. The
committee referred that contempt vote against Enron to the full
Senate today.

                        Others Comply

     Mirant has already turned over about 160,000 pages of
documents, Drivon said. The committee voted to nullify the
contempt charge against Mirant. AES Corp. Duke Energy Corp.,
Dynegy Inc., NRG Energy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc. and Williams
Cos. have begun to comply with the subpoenas, Dunn said.
     During today's hearing, members of the Senate select
committee said Enron has been less forthcoming with information
than the other companies, and its tone has been more combative.
     ``We have gotten no indication that Enron ever intends to
comply with the subpoena, and that's why we're here,'' said
Democratic Senator Debra Bowen, a member of the committee and
chairwoman of the Senate's utilities committee.

                       `Never Had Hearings'

     Enron's attorney said the company complied with the subpoena
by detailing its objections to the document requests in a June 28
letter. Enron is being held in contempt without due process, Kirby
said.
     ``We have made objections and we have never had hearings on
the objections,'' Kirby told the committee.
     California claims energy generators and traders overcharged
the state by $8.9 billion. Talks ordered by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to settle those allegations broke down this
week without an agreement. Energy generators and traders had
offered California a total of $716 million in refunds.
     FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner asked federal
regulators to determine appropriate refunds, if any.
     California Governor Gray Davis said that if the state isn't
awarded the full $8.9 billion, it will sue the energy companies.
     ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion
in refunds, we will see you in court,'' Davis said yesterday.
