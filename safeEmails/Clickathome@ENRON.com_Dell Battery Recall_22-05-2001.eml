As you may have heard, Dell is voluntarily recalling certain batteries from =
some of the Dell Inspiron laptops.  The recalled batteries were sold with th=
e Inspiron 5000 series notebook computers, comprising both the Inspiron 5000=
 and the Inspiron 5000e models (please see the bottom of your computer for m=
odel ID).  The systems and/or batteries were shipped to customers between Ja=
nuary 7, 2000 and March 21, 2001.

As a result, you will have the opportunity to return your battery in exchang=
e for a new one.  We appreciate your patience through this process.  Dell is=
 committed to your continued service and is sincerely apologetic for the sit=
uation.
