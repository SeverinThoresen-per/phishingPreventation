The incremental financing cost, by my calculation is less than 100,000 and i=
t=20
was determined to be prudent in light of ENA's interest in keeping these=20
off-balance sheet, regardless of their use in Canada or the US.  My estimate=
=20
is based on 26MM balance, four month average duration (staggered payments),=20
6% interest rate and 15% withholding tax.  Matt Berry of ENA Finance and=20
Morris Clark were part of our discussion on this matter.  The reason that we=
=20
do not look at it over an extended term is becasue this West LB structure wa=
s=20
put in place as a bridge until Enron determined if the machines were to be=20
used in Canada or the US.  At that time Enron would put in place either a=20
Canadian or US permanent structure that would be more tax-efficient.

I am available to talk about this further.  Let me know.

Chris

John, the attached is a summary by Greg of the financining for the turbines=20
purchased from New Brunswick Power.

In summary, ECC pays the bank, West LB directly in three installments under=20
an off-balance sheet lease financing arrangement.  The first installment of=20
$US 9MM was made Dec. 1/99.  The next installment is due Feb. 1/00 of $US=20
8MM, and the third installment is due roughly March 31/00 of $US 8MM. The=20
"drag" on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its=20
off-balance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax=20
purposes, and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a 15%=20
withholding tax payment on the interest (not principal) component of each=20
lease/financing payment.  An off-balance sheet financing with a Canadian=20
resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency, and=20
this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be=20
required to restructure the turbine financing.  The withholding tax if we=20
keep this structure will total roughly C$ 500,000 over all of the=20
lease/financing payments (Chris Calger has the exact figure).  Any decision=20
to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transactio=
n=20
costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident off-balance=20
sheet lender.  In addition, if we decide to keep the turbines, or sell or=20
transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party (depending on commercially wha=
t=20
it is we decide to do with them), additional work may be required to take=20
title to the turbines, or to assign/restructure the West LB financing and th=
e=20
New Brunswick Power purchase agreement.  I am confident that the bulk of=20
commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled=20
internally, but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside=20
counsel.

We are also obligated to pay GST, but this is ultimately reimbursed through=20
the lease financing (althoguh there is a time value of money component that=20
is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made).

Subject: WestLB Transaction

Peter, referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanic=
s=20
of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power=20
turbines, please be advised as follows:

1.  Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement (the=20
"Agreement") with WestLB, all of ENA's interest in that Agreement was=20
immediately assigned to Enron Canada, meaning that we are directly=20
responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing=20
payments to WestLB.

2.  The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amoun=
t=20
of US$9,000,000 on December 1, 1999.  GST was payable on US$5,000,000 of tha=
t=20
amount.

3.  The next installment is due to NB Power on February 1, 2000 and is for a=
n=20
amount of US$8,000,000.  Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request=20
in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance.  WestLB=20
will then attend to paying the installment payment (plus GST) to NB Power on=
=20
Feb 1.

4.  The final installment payment is for an amount of US$8,000,000 and is du=
e=20
on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines=20
and March 31, 2000.

5.  The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB, who is not registered in=20
Canada to carry on business, is that we are required to pay withholding tax=20
of 15% on all costs of borrowing (ie. interest payments).  The interest is=20
calculated at a LIBOR rate.

6.  WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will=
=20
be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GS=
T=20
rebate, which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement.

7.  WestLB is aware that, depending on how we proceed with our required use=20
of the turbines, they will be taken out either with respect to (i) the=20
interim financing or, if the interim financing period is short (ie. if we=20
were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and=20
commence moving them), (ii) when we put the SPV in place to build the=20
project. =20

8.  If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into=
=20
the US, the withholding tax issue obviously disappears.  If we determine to=20
proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period=20
will be more than a month or so, it probably makes sense to remove WestLB=20
from the interim financing, thereby saving ourselves the cost of the=20
withholding tax.  One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as=
=20
funding agent, with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk, which=20
could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the=20
financing arrangement.  We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions=
,=20
so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is=20
viable.

I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to=
=20
proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue, but if you would like=
=20
to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to=20
discuss, I am happy to do so. =20

Greg
