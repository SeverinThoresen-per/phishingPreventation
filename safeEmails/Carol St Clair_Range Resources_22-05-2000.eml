John and Molly:
I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here i=
s=20
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already=20
notified them that they needed to post collateral:=20

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2=
=20
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us. =20

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination=20
Date.  The "Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we=20
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation=20
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they=20
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early=20
Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequentl=
y=20
provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters=
=20
that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all=20
outstanding trades.

All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they=20
won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out.
