	The accounting/Market Service SGA conference is being held this year in
	New Orleans on September 26 - 28.  I would like for each team to pick a
	candidate to attend this meeting.  If you attended last year, it would be
	good to give someone else an opportunity this year to attend.

	A few of the highlights of the conference are:
		Internet Billing presentation and discussion
		Presentation on electric deregulation
		Natural Gas Prices
		Challenges and issues for electric scheduling and accounting

	Please let me know who you candidate will be by Monday, August 27.
	If you have any questions about the conference, you can give me, Larry or
	Raetta a call.

	Thanks. Lynn
