Hi Dawn,

I am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts. =
 I do not have signed copies of several Enron Canada agreements.  Would you =
mind faxing them down to me via Twanda as soon as possible on Friday?  We ar=
e on a Lavo deadline.   Thanks.

The people are:  Chad Clark, Mike Cowan, Paul Devries, Eric LeDain, Chris Do=
rland, John McKay, and John Zufferli (only if he signed the one we did for E=
nron Canada for him-- I have the ENA one dated 12/24/99).

I appreciate your assistance.  Please call Twanda before the fax arrives, as=
 it is a central legal department fax and not a private one.

Thanks a lot!!

Michelle
