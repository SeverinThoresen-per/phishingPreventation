Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am workin=
g on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set =
up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This =
deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up =
a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL =
is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed bec=
ause it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant h=
as been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, plea=
se do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as so=
on as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciat=
ed.

Buddy
