Your info is right - although I do hope that all is not dark.  Wouldn't have=
 imagined this outcome two weeks ago.  But when Bob Hall removed his name fr=
om the Netco list, timing was critical in working with potential purchasers =
in the auction process.  There wasn't anyone else to step in, so I did so ju=
st to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition.  I spent =
many hours with the UBS operations team last week, and they are the ones who=
 decided that they wanted me to take the role.  It was the time that I spent=
 with the UBS team that changed my mind about considering the role.  My repo=
rting relationship will be to the head of American operations in Stamford, C=
T.  I am quite impressed with him.  The further negative news here was a fac=
tor as well.  Should be interesting.  --Sally=20
