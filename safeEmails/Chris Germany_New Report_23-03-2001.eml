Subject:  New Report

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports=20
that
they can run.  The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can b=
e
run by internal users as well.  Only reports that are available to all=20
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file=20
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet).  Denn=
is
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started=20
with
the various billing report options.  Since showing all reports didn't requir=
e
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything.  Good=20
idea!
