Hey Chris,

I moved to CT after I met a guy. He is from the area, but we met in CA.
So, now I live on the other coast, and I am a recruiter in the industry.
I guess I just could not stay away from it.  We recruit for energy
trading/marketing companies, front to back office.

I am happy that you are enjoying fatherhood. How are things at Enron?

Ami

I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!

What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?

Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married -
yet)
are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the
time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.
I'm
reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down.
