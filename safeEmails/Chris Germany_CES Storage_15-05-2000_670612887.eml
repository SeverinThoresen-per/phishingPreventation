Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.=
 =20
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the=20
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the=
=20
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume=20
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject=20
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal=20
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the=20
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport=20
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal=20
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have question=
s.

Thanks
