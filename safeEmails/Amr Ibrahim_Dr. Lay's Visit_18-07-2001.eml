This is very good, and succinct, summary from Ban.  Notwithstanding his=20
analysis, I think that we are going to be there for a longer-than-desired=20
period, and Dr. Ley's visit should have been kept for a more opportune time.=
 =20
Of course, I hope that I am wrong.

It follows that the likely way out shall be "renegotiation", "stabilizing",=20
then convergence with the arbitration route in "existing". =20


Best regards

Amr,

There have been differing perceptions about Dr. Lay's visit. Some including=20
myself thought that it was a wasted effort, esp. so because just the day=20
after he left, the Government of Maharashtra called for a judicial probe=20
against Enron. The terms of reference of the probe are to be announced withi=
n=20
a month. A judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts bu=
t=20
is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations. Its a bad signal esp.=20
for investors like us. It shows poorly about how the Indian polity works and=
=20
how misplaced their priorities are, esp. on crucial infrastructure related=20
issues.

Some of us were beginning to think that Dr. Lay's visit is bound to enthuse=20
the Central Government to act more positively and come with more likely=20
solutions, including a possible buyout. However, with a judicial probe being=
=20
announced even the Central Government is forced to re-think its strategy=20
twice before stepping in. Infact, it might be forced to take a back seat.

Internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for Dr. Lay to visi=
t=20
senior officials just to send a signal that "Enron had tried its utmost to=20
thrash out a solution". If necessary another visit would be planned, just to=
=20
reiterate this. This they  feel would help in the long run, esp. when we=20
arbitrate, to drive home the message that we did use all our options to=20
arrive at a solution, unlike the government which just was not forthcoming.=20
What folks here also feel is that the "Chairman of the Company should=20
definitely come to check the boxes".=20

So perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought i=
s=20
the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now.=20
The sooner the better. However, the way the judicial system works here, one=20
can only hope the Supreme Court respects our notice for arbitration in Londo=
n=20
and  helps hasten the process.=20
