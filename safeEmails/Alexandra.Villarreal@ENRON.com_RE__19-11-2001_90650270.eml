Good morning, how are you?  Quite a change huh?  I like it here.  The only p=
roblem is the heat from the monitors.  The heat, My god the heat (a Seinfeld=
 episode).  Anyway, I like it over here.  Really nice. =20

How do you like you new space?  is it okay?  I like being able to peak over =
and see you.  The table has turned.  You have to get up and look back to see=
 me now.  Ha.

I bought you something small this weekend.  I will give it to you later.  It=
 is nothing that important but I thought it was cute.=20

Oh well, I guess I better work.

Have a great day and I hope to talk to you later.

John
