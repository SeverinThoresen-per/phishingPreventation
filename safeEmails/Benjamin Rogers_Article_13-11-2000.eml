DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
----------------------------------------------------------------------------=

 Al Gore and=20

, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com=20

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speec=
h=20
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the=20
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to=20
figure it out.=20

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and=
=20
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight=20
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral=20
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last=20
line of defense?=20

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities.=20

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's=20
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the=20
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to=20
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al=20
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the=20
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work.=20

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more=20
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am=20
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a=20
difficult task.=20

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the=20
Constitution.=20

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I=20
mean?=20

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with=20
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The=20
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of=
=20
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to=
=20
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these=
=20
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards.=20

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results=
=20
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?"=20

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last=20
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria=20
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted.=20

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but=20
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud.=20

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted=
=20
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it=20
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that the=
y=20
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is t=
o=20
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next=20
president of the United States."=20

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins.=20

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for=
=20
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the=20
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a=20
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet.=20
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition=
=20
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to=20
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be =
a=20
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bus=
h=20
campaign's playbook.=20

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the=20
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. To=
o=20
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional=20
authority -- Vice President Al Gore.=20

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.
