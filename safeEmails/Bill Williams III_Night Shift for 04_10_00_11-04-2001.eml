You guys had a busy night last night and did a good job of handling El Paso=20
and getting the reports done.  However, we were not flat this morning in=20
Enpower (long 1600 mws in NP, and short 192 in SP), and because we were not=20
flat in California, the Enpower to Caps report was incorrect.  Variances=20
listed as explained in the Enpower to CAPS report were not.  Your night note=
=20
says however:

CAPS Position Manager:
Flat for both days.

Please make sure you have checked the position manager and updated your nigh=
t=20
note.
Thanks,

Bill
