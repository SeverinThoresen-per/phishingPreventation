Negotiators have 15 days starting yesterday to come to an agreement. If the=20

Morgan Stanley analyst Kit Konolidge said: "We think these numbers are way=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- If the U.S. market for bandwidth is nascent, the marke=
t=20
in Asia is still in the conceptual stage.
But if a market is underdeveloped and the potential is attractive, Enron is=20
probably interested, and it is.=20
Enron knows margins are usually very high in the early stages of any market.=
=20
The company also wants to get established early to capture big market share,=
=20
as it's done in energy markets in the U.S. and Europe.=20
Enron is focused on Asia's four least-regulated markets - Japan, Hong Kong,=20
Singapore and Australia - which account for 70% of the region's wholesale=20
leased-line revenue, said Fred Cohagan, director of global wholesale service=
s=20
in Asia for Enron Broadband Services.=20
Enron began operating a Tokyo pooling point for trading in March, the same=20
month it opened an office in Singapore, said Cohagan, speaking recently from=
=20
Singapore. The trading giant will begin operating pooling points in Hong=20
Kong, Singapore and Sydney next quarter.=20
Enron has a desk of five traders divided among Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo=20
and has commercial people on the ground in Seoul and Hong Kong. Soon, the=20
company will be willing to buy or sell bandwidth in markets for minimum=20
three-month contracts, followed by six-month and one-year quotes. It will=20
quote spot and forward markets - initially for STM1 capacity, then for STM4=20
and DS3.=20
Potential players are well defined. About 50 companies have capacity in one=20
form or another, whether through leases, indefeasible rights of use or equit=
y=20
ownership, Cohagan said.=20
Because the cost of entering the Asian telecom capacity market is high, ther=
e=20
are fewer companies of questionable financial status than in the U.S. and=20
Europe.=20
Prices for transpacific data capacity are four to six times higher than=20
transatlantic prices, said Alan Mauldin, a researcher for Telegeography, a=20
telecommunications research and data firm in Washington, D.C.=20
Ron Banaszek, director of TFS Telecom, a bandwidth brokerage in New York=20
City, gave a still greater spread between transpacific and transatlantic=20
prices. An STM1 between Los Angeles and Tokyo is probably $90,000 a month,=20
compared with $10,000 for an STM1 from New York to London, he said.=20
That's because there's about three times as much capacity in the=20
transatlantic market as in the transpacific market, Mauldin said. Growing=20
Room=20

The Asian market, however, needs some foundation work done. Standard=20
contracts need to be developed, and players need to understand the idea of=20
liquidated damages for nonperformance.=20
There's also the challenge of introducing market prices in an area accustome=
d=20
to basing prices on costs, said Ciara Ryan, head of Arthur Andersen's=20
bandwidth trading team.=20
Carriers deployed the Asian and transpacific networks according to five-year=
=20
market forecasts. They projected how much demand there would be for capacity=
=20
in five years, built networks to handle that much demand and are trying to=20
sell capacity at prices based on the cost of laying and lighting the=20
networks.=20
Carriers, which have walked away from deals to sell below cost in the past,=20
are reluctant to lower prices while waiting for demand to rise to the level=20
of supply. But the weak financial state of many carriers has forced them to=20
think again about the revenue they could be earning now from their invested=20
capital.=20
"I'd definitely say I've seen lots of interest," Cohagan said.=20
He wouldn't name specific companies, but said all the global and regional=20
carriers are interested. Enron has already done deals with global companies,=
=20
Internet service providers, corporations and regional carriers for capacity=20
in Asia, he said. Corporate interest comes from energy and software=20
companies.=20
Some regional carriers are interested in seasonal wholesale markets for=20
capacity to the United States on a weekly basis, he said. He wouldn't=20
disclose the reason for the demand for seasonal capacity, indicating that it=
=20
was proprietary information.=20
Demand is coming from companies wanting capacity to the United States from=20
Asia, rather than capacity between individual countries in Asia, said Lionel=
=20
Guerrara, a consultant with Arthur Andersen in London.=20
Some of that demand comes from European companies, he said. Because there's=20
little capacity available directly from Asia to Europe, companies on the=20
Continent buy capacity from Asia to the U.S., across the States and then=20
across the Atlantic to Europe. It's a less direct route, but it can be=20
lower-priced.=20

Indian State Ministers Defer Decision on Utility Dues to July 6
2001-06-26 11:24 (New York)


     New Delhi, June 26 (Bloomberg) -- Indian provincial ministers
deferred a decision on the steps they should take to repay about
$8.5 billion of dues owed by state power companies to generators,
to July 6, as ministers disagreed on the terms of the payback.
     The ministers today met to discuss a report submitted by a
government panel in May on how to repay the debt. The report
suggests state governments take on the liability by issuing tax-
free bonds at 8.5 percent. Not all the ministers agree with the
conditions mentioned in the report.
     State electricity companies supplying power to ``rural areas
is a social obligation, it's not only the state government's
obligation and all these issues have to be seen in the macro
view,'' Digvijay Singh, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh said.
``We have asked for some more time to come to a consensus.''
     Most of the state electricity boards in the country are loss-
making as they sell electricity to farmers at highly subsidized
rates. The accumulated losses of these boards, is about 400
billion rupees ($8.5 billion), and the inability of these boards
to repay their dues may hinder further foreign investment in the
sector.
     ``It has become necessary to take a hard look at the power
sector to make sure whoever generates power gets paid for it,''
Krishna Chandra Pant, deputy chairman of India's planning
commission told reporters. ``This is coming in the way of foreign
direct investment in the sector.''

                               Enron

     Enron Corp.'s Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., stopped
generating power in May after the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board refused to pay 3 billion rupees in dues to Dabhol. Enron is
the country's biggest foreign investor and has spent $3 billion on
building its power plant.
     The board has refused to pay, saying Dabhol's price is more
than double the rate charged by other Indian generators, and has
stopped buying power from Dabhol. It also charged Dabhol an 8
billion-rupee penalty for not supplying power at full capacity on
three days between January and March.
     The dispute is also a concern for rating agencies such as
Moody's Investors Service.
     Kristin Lindow, vice president and lead analyst at Moody's
said she was concerned about the dispute, which is widely seen as
a litmus test for foreign investment in India.
     ``Foreign investors are becoming wary because of Enron's
problem and the government's failure to honor its contractual
obligation,'' Lindow said. ``It has put up several red flags.''
