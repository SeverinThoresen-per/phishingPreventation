For your reference I am forwarding the following from Cindy Adams.  The bott=
om line is she deserves to have her record amended to expunge any negative c=
omments resulting from her tenure in Mr. Sutton's office.  I will leave it t=
o you professionals to do the right thing.  Please advise Ms. Adams on how b=
est to proceed.

Tim, absolutely.  You have my permission to pass this information on to HR a=
nd any member of senior management as I need to fill in the gap she created =
in my resume, as I am going to require references.  Not only would I like to=
 persuade Pam to put her apology in writing, I've contemplated contacting Jo=
e Sutton to set the record straight as Pam blocked me all three times I requ=
ested through HR having a meeting with Joe in the presence of my HR represen=
tative and Pam as well.  I think he should also know the truth.

Thank you Tim for your feedback, as I continue to appreciate and value your =
advice.=20

Tim, I just wanted to share with you the matter of my having received a tele=
phone call a week ago from Pam Benson (formerly of Joe Sutton's office).  Sh=
e was the admin with Joe Sutton's office who'd approached me and then insist=
ed I had to come work with her in supporting Joe's office even after I had t=
old HR and her I wasn't interested.

She was also responsible for eliminating me from Joe's office in his absence=
 upon her return from her surgery after I had supported his office  having b=
een complimented by him verbally to Pam in my presence as having taken what =
he referred to  as "the best planned trip he'd been on in years with everyth=
ing in place". (This was in reference to his trip around the world when he w=
ent to India to meet with President Clinton.)

Pam said she's "had me on her mind for a long time" then proceeded with:
"I was going to call you at home but was uncertain that the number I had was=
 correct, so decided to call you at Enron since I knew you were there."=20
"I had to call to tell you I've had you on my mind for a long time and that =
I need to tell you how very sorry I am for what I did to you, Cindy.  You di=
dn't deserve to be treated like that."  "You are a fine person" and then she=
 broke down crying on the telephone.  Pam said she hoped in her heart I woul=
d forgive her and that "she didn't deserve to talk to me". =20

She said she had retired and was calling me from her home and that "God had =
been talking to her and told her to make this telephone call and that she ne=
eded to call to apologize to me for what she had done to me." She said twice=
, "if there is anything I can do for you emotionally or financially, please =
call me and I will do whatever I can to help you."  My only response to Pam =
was, "Pam,  I  do not understood why you did it."  =20

Tim, in all of my years employed within the corporate environment, I have ne=
ver encountered anyone like Pam Benson before who would harbor jealousy to t=
he point where they would want to destroy a person's reputation among their =
peers and professional associates and manipulate someone's career.  Of cours=
e she caught me off guard calling me here at the office around 11:00 am whic=
h left me speechless.  I found her call strange as so much time has passed. =
 Her disruptive behavior only reflected her thoughts.=20

I just thought I'd share this with you.  Some people never cease to amaze me=
=2E =20

Cindy
