VTS--

I received a call from Lara Leibman, who informs me that the DOJ has=20
initiated its investigation into SDG&E arising out of the SW Marine=20
activities.  The DOJ lawyer assigned to the investigation has yet to issue a=
=20
Civil Investigative Demand in this matter due to other priorities, but she=20
intends to focus on SDG&E after the New Year.  The DOJ lawyer has requested =
a=20
meeting shortly after New Years with Lara and myself to discuss the matter. =
=20
Lara is trying to arrange a meeting sometime in the middle of the week of 10=
=20
Jan, which would allow us to caucus with Mike Kahn and Sam Miller in San=20
Francisco first, and then fly from SF to DC.  Jeff I am assuming that you=20
would be attending as well.

I would appreciate your thoughts as to how much internal discussion we shoul=
d=20
have before meeting with the DOJ, or any other suggestions.
