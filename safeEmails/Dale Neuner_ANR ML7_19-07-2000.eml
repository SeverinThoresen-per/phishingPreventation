Below are two e-mails sent to you on their respective dates. I think we are=20
ready to push on with the ANR ML7 Delivery Location and have suggested some=20
language based on comments from Kevin (e-mail dated 5-12). Kevin has called=20
and asked for this product. Please offer comments/approval.

I spoke with Mark Schrab in Logistics about the ANR ML7 Product that Kevin=20
Ruscettit would like to start trading and he wasn't able to dispell any=20
beliefs that this is a product that should not be traded, OTC or otherwise.

Mark explained that often times on this pipe there were cuts due to=20
operational constraints. I explained that we had drafted language to=20
contemplate these occurances. I then asked Mark what would happen if there=20
was a cut due to op constraints, and Mark explained that he would try to fin=
d=20
another Buyer along the pipe. I probed further, and found that there would b=
e=20
no revision of the contract, nor a re-pricing of the transaction due to the=20
re-scheduling. I then read Mark the language under consideration (making sur=
e=20
he understood that this was conceptual) and he agreed that the language=20
provided for something that we are already doing operationally. Mark had=20
never seen the language we propse for use for this Product.=20

I think Logistics may have been issuing an opinion on their point without=20
being fully aware of what we were attempting to offer, and I certainly don't=
=20
blame them for doing so - as we all make decisions based on the information=20
at hand.

I would like to proceed with this Product.

I spoke with Kevin Ruscetti, the trader, and Kevin has clarified for me that=
=20
the product he intends to trade on ANR ML7 is NOT Interruptable gas, but=20
rather subject to operational constraints like Socal Topock. He did request,=
=20
however, that we make reference to secondary firm delivery.

Below please find the op constraints language that we use. I also added a=20
secondary delivery blurb; please feel free to edit - and then I'll get this=20
in front of Kevin for his review.


The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7=20
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be=20
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on=
=20
the ANR Pipeline Company pipelines=20
based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these=20
constraints are excused=20
nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm=20
gas. In the event that the volumes=20
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints occur, Buye=
r=20
may designate=20
a secondary firm delivery location.
