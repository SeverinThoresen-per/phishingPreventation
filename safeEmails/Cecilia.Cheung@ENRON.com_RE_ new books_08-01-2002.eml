Yes, I can set up the new books if you can provide me the book short names a=
nd book codes.  But the book needs to be first set up in Global then I can s=
et it up in Tagg/Erms.  Contact Cheryl Johnson to set up new books in Global=
=2E  Once she completed then I can finish the rest.

Call me if you have any questions.

Cecilia,

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will b=
e taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluc=
tant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These book=
s are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  =
Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limi=
tations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short nam=
es.

Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.

Thanks

Kam
