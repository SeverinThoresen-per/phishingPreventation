Cassandra,

Richard asked me to review this document before the traders on the UK Gas=20
Desk would sign it.

The UK gas desk adheres to all the risk management requirements of this=20
document. However, in Section VII , Miscellaneous, Employee Trading, the=20
document would appear to prevent any of us trading equities (amongst other=20
commodities) on our personal account as Equity Trading is a Commodity Group.=
=20
We are unsure if this is the aim of this agreement.

We have asked our compliance officer, Paul Simons to clarify the impact of=20
this clause for us.

We are not ignoring the document, we are waiting for clarification.

Thank you,

David Redmond
