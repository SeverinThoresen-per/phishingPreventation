Joe,

As discussed, please repath January 2001 for contract 101559.  I have input =
the rates on the invoice that Jeff Nielsen said he agreed to.  However, ther=
e are certain paths for the same period of time that Oneok indicated differe=
nt rates for each.  They should be consistent so I input one rate for all pa=
ths on a Mid to Mid basis.  Therefore, after you repath the invoice, we will=
 still have a difference.  I want to write-off whatever balance still exists=
 after repathing.  Please prepare the write-off documentation and I will sig=
n.  We need to be sure to do this before we go into next year.  Also, this i=
s the only invoice you have provided me that had issues on this contract whi=
ch I find hard to believe.   Can you double-check to see that there are no o=
ther A/R issues for this IT contract and let me know ASAP.

Thanks!
Vernon
