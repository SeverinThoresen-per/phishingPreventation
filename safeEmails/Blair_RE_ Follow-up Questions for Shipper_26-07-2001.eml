Subject:	Follow-up Questions for Shipper

I attended a meeting with a Shipper yesterday who had questions that I promi=
sed to answer when I returned to the office.  Three of them are questions fo=
r you.

1) 	In order to use the 8:00 AM cycle for true-ups, since you cannot have a =
new path on the 8:00 AM, is it possible to put in a zero nom path to use for=
 adjustments 	in the 8:00 AM? Yes
2)	What is considered a new nom when looking at non-on-time noms?  For insta=
nce, if you have a nom on the on-time and change the ID of upstream/downstre=
am 	shippers on the 6:00PM, is this considered a new nom which jeopardizes f=
lowing gas rights - especially if it was alternate firm? (what exactly trigg=
ers the system to 	view a change to any info that was in place as a new nom)
	Key Fields trigger a new path.  John will get you the fields.
3)	Is there a way, by Contract, to not allow a nom to be put in place if it =
is outside the contract alternate points (they don't want to be hit with Max=
 Rates if their 	scheduler noms from a point they shouldn't have)?  No, the =
alternate template is all reciept points and all delivery points   =20

Also, they were delighted to hear that you would be willing to possibly come=
 to their office to give an in depth scheduling discussion and may take you =
up on it.  I'll let you know.  We will need to meet with you before you go (=
if you go - may not be necessary or requested).  Just let me know if they ca=
ll you, I am sure I can find SOMEONE to go to Virginia. =20

Thanks!
