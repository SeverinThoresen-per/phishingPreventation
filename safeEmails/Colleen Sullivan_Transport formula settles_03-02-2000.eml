Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the=20
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as=20
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as=
=20
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or=20
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), bu=
t=20
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating=20
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there ar=
e=20
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could=20
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The=20
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index=
=20
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue=20
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES=20
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using=20
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport=
=20
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and=20
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings=20
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are=20
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which=20
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other=
=20
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more=20
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you. =20
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads=
=20
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know=20
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),=20
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work=20
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling=20
daily:

CNG North City Gate =3D GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate =3D Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their=20
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate =3D GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one=
=20
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any=20
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.
