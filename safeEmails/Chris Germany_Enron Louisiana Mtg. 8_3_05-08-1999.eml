I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting=
=20
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's=20
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production=20
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to=
=20
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to=20
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)=20
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366. =
=20
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez. =
=20
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait=20
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on=
=20
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?
