Rudy-
In the contract it says that nominations for the following month are firm=20
while the 60 and 90 day ranges are just estimates.  Since taking delivery of=
=20
the smaller ship causes us to nominate another cargo within the same month,=20
we were stipulating that only the first nomination is firm as the contract=20
defines it.  With all that being said, we are still planning on working=20
together as usual for a  schedule that works for both sides.
Regards,
Dan

Dan:

Could you confirm the reference in the following:

* This nomination not to count as firm per clause 7.2 (a) (v) due to April
4-8 delivery being a small cargo.

I don't understand your point.

Thanks,
Rudy
