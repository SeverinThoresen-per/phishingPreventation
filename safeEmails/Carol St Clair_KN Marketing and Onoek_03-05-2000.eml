Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneo=
k=20
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing=20
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are=20
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently=20
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a=20
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its=20
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When=
=20
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all=20
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Maste=
r=20
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the=20
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this. =20
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master=
=2E

Carol
