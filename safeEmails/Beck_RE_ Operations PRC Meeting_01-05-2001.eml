Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At =
this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC me=
etings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On Ju=
ne 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC mee=
tings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure =
that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the=
 individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be =
to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operation=
s organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still de=
bating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team)=20

u to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar. =20

My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Cau=
sey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set =
