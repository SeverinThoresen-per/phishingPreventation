A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read =
this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages =
after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be =
rolled out next year.

Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has =

finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 3=
1st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as eac=
h trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be availab=
le at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with y=
our backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are fi=
nished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed d=
ial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece =
