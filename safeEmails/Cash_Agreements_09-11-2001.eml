John and Louise						,

I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in =
mind.

I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those pe=
rsons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready=
 to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp=
=2E  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of t=
ax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company =
name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.

Let me know if you would like any more information.  You can reach me at 3-6=
401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.

Michelle
