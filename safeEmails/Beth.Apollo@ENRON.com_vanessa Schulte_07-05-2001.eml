Just to keep you in the loop.  I have encouraged here not to go for the "Exe=
cutive Program" but to go for a regular MBA at U of H  -- there will be no t=
ime off of work, it is an evening/weekend program.

I am in the process of filling out a reference form for her.

My understanding is that this falls under the normal Enron Educational assis=
tance program and we don't have to get any other approvals.

Is this the correct approach?

Beth
