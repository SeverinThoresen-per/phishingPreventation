With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty wou=
ld have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/could n=
ot  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The que=
stion we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support from=
 OPG. 																																							With respect to point 2, I thin=
k we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's /Purchase's c=
omments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are delivered b=
y the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed not to move =
forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comfortable saying=
 this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB (o=
r at least one that they can interpret as being negative). I agree with you =
that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good. Th=
e likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain. The key =
issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC access to the data they need fr=
om HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  the gov't's interest in an indu=
stry resolution of  customer duplications prior to market opening in order t=
o avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the market, the  state of cu=
stomer education, and a contingency plan to accommodate those who are not re=
ady.  																														- with respect to EBT, I think the best =
we can do is get onside quickly with our  EBT hub of choice  and work with t=
hem on perceived difficulties 		with LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are g=
oing to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our preferred EBT hub.  	=
																							-with respect to the info from HydroOne, I  have alre=
ady raised this issue with the OEB and the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subseque=
ntly met with 		HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue.  My=
 understanding, until yesterday's discussion with Conway, was that the issue=
 was resolved 	and the information was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garret=
t  and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday =
re     		resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them as well. 	=
																													- with respect to the CIS issue, there is not m=
uch we can do since most  LDCs already have a CIS vendor; but my understandi=
ng is that at least 		one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a =
number of LDCs recently (per David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendo=
r 		to move in quickly to fill that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to =
see what may be feasible at this stage. 																										- with res=
pect to the customer duplication issue, I have already met with the senior p=
eople at Direct (last week)  to discuss this issue with them and to 	propose=
 a resolution that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party =
 (such as E&Y)  to assess the degree of overlap and whether 		there was an a=
cceptable solution to any problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of du=
plication is not high.  Direct is talking to Onsource 		and Toronto about th=
is. 	I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a simila=
r issue when the UK market opened and, if so, how it was 	resolved. . 						=
																															-with respect to customer education, I and Di=
ck Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne, Onsour=
ce, Enersource, 		and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer educa=
tion initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss this i=
dea 		 further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron of  up=
 to $200,000. 																													- with respect to the contingency=
 plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is already on side =
in recognizing the need for a contingency 	plan - it will likely be very sim=
ple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill=
 customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral 	account). The key  issue wil=
l be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not ready and what is=
 the minimum number of LDCs that 		the OEB/gov't is looking for to be ready.=
 This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as well as the OEB	=
, since ultimately the 			decision of whether enough LDCs are ready will be =
a political one.																													These are the OEB/retail focuss=
ed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I have several  ide=
as about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss with you and Pau=
l. 																																																			=09

Market Opening=09



Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 500=
MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the On=
tario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something =
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, follo=
wing Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term she=
et to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap str=
ucture.=20

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September r=
eadiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall =
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and t=
he OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce=
 a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the =
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a positi=
on that one LDC  could halt market opening.=20

Rob
