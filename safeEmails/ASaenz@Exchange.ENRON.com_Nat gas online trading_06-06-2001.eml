Hi Geoff,

Chris Gaskill said you might be able to help me out.=20

 I am working on an eCommerce report for EOL and I am trying to determine wh=
o the players are for trading nat gas online.  (Of course, all of the compan=
ies I have researched say they are leading the market)...Any way, I was wond=
ering what online trading plaforms you use for trading nat gas besides EOL. =
 If you could help me out that would be great.=20

Thanks,
Angela Saenz
