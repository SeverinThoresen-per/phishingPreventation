Louise,

I understand from Michael Brown that you are my boss again (lucky you). I al=
so understand that you have a ton of things on your plate but I have an issu=
e that needs to be addressed and your help/clarification would be much appre=
ciated. =20

I am not sure whether we are going be shutting things down or going slow ove=
r near term but the guys in the states are canceling contracts with European=
 clients that could lead to lawsuits and will severely harm the business. =20

Less urgent is a deal that is in document/credit that we have put on the bac=
kburner, which could generate significant revenues this quarter (between $30=
 and $40 million in pv on an index deal).  I would like to discuss.


regards,
bruce
