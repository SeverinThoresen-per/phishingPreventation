The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and=20
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal.=20
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to=20
Desk" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done=20
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our=20
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their=20
stuff, they should see their side.=20

        Cara,

     This is all I have so far. I would appreciate your help to make it=20
clearer.

     If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.


     Thanks,
     Kroum

Forward Obs should show two sides of a Cross-Portfolio deal.  Find out what=20
needs to be done.  Contact Monica
Lande or Kate Symes in Portland for more details
