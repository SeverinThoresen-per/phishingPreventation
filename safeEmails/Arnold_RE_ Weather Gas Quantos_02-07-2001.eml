We, at the weather desk, are designing a product that pays with gas-price ex=
posure (HDD products that pay in financial equivalents to MMBtus). The solut=
ion for this product requires the trading in gas and in weather.

We are in a point to establish the real dynamic of trading, which products t=
o trade. We would like to have some input. To whom should we talk to have th=
is guidance?

Thanks for the help,

Claudio Ribeiro
