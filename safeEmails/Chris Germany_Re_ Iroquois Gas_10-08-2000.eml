Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to=20
overlap the contract or do any segmenting. =20

Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We=20
currently only have a 2017 dkt/d term contract #125005, a 35,465 dkt/d term=20
contract #125008, an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handl=
e=20
our Canadian term supply.  We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, t=
o=20
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline.  That is a simplified summary of our=20
daily activity on Iroquois.  If you need any information, please let me=20
know. =20

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,=20
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented=20
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the=20
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement=20
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not=
)=20
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance,=20
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the=20
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too length=
y=20
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business o=
n=20
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comment=
s=20
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.
