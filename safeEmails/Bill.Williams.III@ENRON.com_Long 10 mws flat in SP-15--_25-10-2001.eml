Group,
We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.

For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24=
hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will=
 be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please s=
ell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I=
 have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy int=
o the ST-WBOM load zone.=20

Do call with questions.
Cell: 503-887-3449

Thanks,
Bill
