Dave,

I actually have asked Rodney long time ago that I wanted to be a part of the=
 Monday morning meetings but he didn't want anyone other than traders in tha=
t meeting. I guess he changed his mind. Anyways, I would love to be a part o=
f the meetings and maybe Karen and I can take turn to go in there.

Dave,

At a number of the pulp meetings we have had discussions around information =
we would like to gather in the marketplace.  Until now I had been erring on =
the side of smaller meetings to facilitate better discussion but I think it =
would be more helpful to have one person from fundamentals present at the pu=
lp meetings on Mondays at 9:00.  This should be the person that is doing mos=
t of the work on pulp.  Please let me know who you think the best person to =
attend would be.

Thanks,
Rodney
