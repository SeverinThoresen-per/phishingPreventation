We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have=20
significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working=20
some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do. =
=20
I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and =
I=20
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really wan=
t=20
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you=20
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to hav=
e=20
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money),=20
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are=20
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and=20
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be=20
acceptable to GE. =20

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls=20
scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone "quiet time" to review=20
the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it.=20

We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.

Kay
