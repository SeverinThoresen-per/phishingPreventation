You need to work for Sally Beck on this.  She is responsible for this and is=
=20
a Managing Director responsible for all mid and back office, outsourcing or=20
otherwise.  She must approve anything that goes out becuase it will effect=20
her directly.

Phillipe is also very reluctant to "sell" any systems, especially if we have=
=20
to support applications installed behind their firewall.  We are probably=20
fine with most ASP models.  You need to meet with Sally as team on this ASAP=
=2E

After meeting with Sally, let me know what everyone agreed on.  I am in all=20
day.

Thanks.

Greg and Rex,

Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo. =20

Here are a few points I think will help. =20

=A3 I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy=
 to=20
Travis McCullough this morning
=A3 At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially p=
art=20
of the bid yet
=A3 I will work very hard to keep everyone informed

The following points protect Enron from significant risk:

  1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth,=20
David, Rahul and myself)
  2)  We did not quote any price for software or services
  3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. W=
e=20
do not participate in this work.
  4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing softwar=
e=20
from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is=20
not priced.  The option would be explored during a "make versus buy" analysi=
s=20
within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).=
 =20
This gives us time to clarify our plans.

I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of=
=20
the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is=20
time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul=
=20
and hopefully he can get appropriate input.

- Steve

Who is the lawyer on this?

Can I see a copy of our proposal?

Sally Beck will have to see this first thing Monday morning and should be=20
included on all e-mail traffic related to this.

Beth Apollo should be in the middle of this as well Beth Perlman and Rahil.

Greg --

FYI.  Steve Abbanat has been working with Beth and Rahil to drive our=20

A brief update:

I spoke with the proposal leads at CGI (Greg Felton and Company) this=20
morning, and all appears to be on schedule.

=A3 Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very=20
interested
=A3 Greg received Enron's materials and they are more than sufficient for ou=
r=20
current proposal needs
=A3 I received a draft of CGI's proposed teaming agreement.  I made made edi=
ts=20
according to my knowledge of Enron's legal policies.  I will forward the=20
document to legal if CGI accepts the changes
=A3 Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to Enron=
,=20
for review, this weekend and on Monday
=A3 The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS
=A3 Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.=
 =20
We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our=
=20
internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on=20
CGI's advice.
=A3 Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how=
 we=20
might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems=
=20
solutions

Thanks for everyone's support.
Steve
