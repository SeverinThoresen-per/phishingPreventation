Ed,
 I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for=20
the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an=20
officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk=20
heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign. =20
Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this=20
counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone=20
on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the=20
contract be done in ENA's name.
