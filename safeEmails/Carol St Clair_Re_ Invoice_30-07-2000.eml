Suzanne:
Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more tim=
e=20
out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you=
=20
sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to=20
stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that=20
talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. =20
Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we=20
are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approac=
h=20
normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we=20
both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound=
=20
since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enoug=
h=20
to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the=20
christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for=
=20
that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very=20
much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.

Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I=20
would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.

I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few=20
weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do=20
so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I=20
should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I=20
apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? =20
I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet=20
(which I know you will).

As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family=20
except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill=
=20
that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty=20
(and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given=20
us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the=20
doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I=20
really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.

Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by=20
for a visit.

Carol
