Lets do what we can. It does sound like it would be less volatile if settled=
 daily. Rick

The originator who closed that deal in 1998 (or thereabouts) left a year ago=
 or more, Sandra McDonald I believe. I can have Mike Garberding look into it=
 if you like as he is very familiar with these structures. Jeff's issue, he =
called me as well, is that we post to APEA monthly yet Chase posts to Enron =
daily (or vice versa depending on the market) which can cause large exposure=
s both ways. It's probably a good idea from both of our sides to correct tha=
t from a liquidity and credit perspective. I'll ask Mike to see if anyone le=
ft at Enron is familiar with APEA to open this discussion with them. The dif=
ficult part may be amending the margin agreement as I would assume these doc=
uments were pledged to the municipal bond holders.

Jeff Delapino (sp?) from Chase has asked me to look into the above transacti=
on to change from monthly collateralization to daily. Do you know who is fam=
iliar with this deal? Rick
