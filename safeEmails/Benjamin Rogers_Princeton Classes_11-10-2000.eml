Robbie:
I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just=20
recently.  What I'm looking for is a private Math tutor.  I wasn't sure if I=
=20
had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you.  =
I=20
liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on on=
e=20
sessions. If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!
