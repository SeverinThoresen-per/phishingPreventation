Thanks for the follow up. =20

Need the cost data as early on Friday as possible.

Beth and Evan meeting went well.  All around circumstances and pressure have=
 "merged" them into one team.  Every situation has its upsides.

5:00 PM meetings are going well...making a lot of progress.  Real $'s moving=
 in the door faster.

Need a big kid to manage CSC asap.

Soccer season is over.  Elizabeth's team - 2nd place overall.  Medals, troph=
ies, the works.  All were excited - and now in bed.

Thanks and see you on Friday.  Stop by anytime.

Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time t=
o get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard =
copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page for=
mat, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I =
tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer. =20

Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I h=
ave been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeti=
ng was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting req=
uired a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with y=
ou at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen. =20

How are your 5:00 pm meetings? =20

I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally=20


Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!
