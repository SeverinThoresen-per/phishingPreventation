John,

Please forward the following message to NNG reps:


On Wednesday, July 11, Wisconsin Gas will begin sending EDI confirmations to=
 NNG at all points that they confirm.  The first EDI file should come in for=
 the July 12 Timely Cycle.  Wisconsin Gas will send NNG the confirmation and=
 NNG will respond with the confirmation response and, if applicable, an unso=
licited response on line items NNG has that Wisconsin Gas did not send.  Wis=
consin Gas will not be sending a confirmation response quick response.  This=
 confirmation process will be similar to WEPCO's confirmation process.

Thanks,
Mary
