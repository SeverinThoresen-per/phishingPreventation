Subject: Conversion of Gatherco Stations

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain=20
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia=20
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your=
=20
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was=20
"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now b=
e=20
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25=20
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000=
=20
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission=
=20
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this=20
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the tim=
e=20
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with thes=
e=20
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27=20
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any=20
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.


Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi Griffith
