Oneok sends Northern helium volumes monthly attached to their Third Party Bu=
shton Allocation Report. Oneok ran a test for November's Production which pr=
oduced some volume (approximately 1000 mcf per Sherry Rogers /Oneok) to be r=
eflected on their statement for November's production. Market Services will =
keep you undated each month by e-mail on any actual helium produced at the B=
ushton Plant.

If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 853-6600.
