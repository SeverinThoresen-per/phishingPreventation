 2 Partnerships Interests Wall Street

Enron Corp. yesterday took a $1.01 billion charge mostly connected with writ=
e-downs of soured investments, producing a $618 million third-quarter loss. =
The loss highlights the risom a pipeline com a particular slice raises anew =
vexing conflict-of-interest questions. The slice is connected with a pair of=
 limited partnerships that until recently were run by Enron's chief financia=
l officer. The company said the charge connected with the partnerships is $3=
5 million and involves the "early termination . . . of certain structured fi=
nance arrangements."
Two years ago, the chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, entered into t=
he unusual arrangement with his employer. With the approval of the board of =
Enron, Mr. Fastow set up and ran the partnerships that stood to make him mil=
lions or more, according to partnership documents. While the company says th=
at this arrangement was proper, some corporate-governance watchdogs have que=
stioned whether a chief financial officer, who is responsible for overseeing=
 the financial interests of the company, should have been involved in such a=
 partnership that was, among other things, looking to purchase assets from E=
nron.=20
The two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the much larger LJM2 Co-Investment L=
P, have engaged in billions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with =
Enron involving company assets and millions of shares of Enron stock. It isn=
't clear from Enron filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission what=
 Enron received in return for providing these assets and shares. In a number=
 of transactions, notes receivable were provided by partnership-related enti=
ties.=20
Mr. Fastow's role as chief financial officer made him privy to internal asse=
t analyses at Enron. An offering memorandum for the LJM2 partnership said th=
at this dual role "should result in a steady flow of opportunities . . . to =
make investments at attractive prices." Mr. Fastow would find his interests =
"aligned" with investors because the "economics of the partnership would hav=
e significant impact on the general partner's wealth," according to this doc=
ument.=20
In a written statement in response to questions, Enron, based in Houston, sa=
id "there never was any obligation for Enron to do any transaction with LJM.=
 Enron and its Board established special review and approval processes with =
its senior management and external audit and legal counsel to ensure that ea=
ch transaction with the LJM partnership was fair, in the best interest of En=
ron and its shareholders, and appropriately disclosed."=20
Mr. Fastow, through an Enron spokesman, declined to be interviewed.=20
In announcing the third-quarter loss, Enron said the partnership-related wri=
te-offs were part of a larger $544 million charge related to the diminished =
value of investments in a retail-power business, broadband telecommunication=
s and technology. In addition, there was also a $287 million write-off resul=
ting from its investment in Azurix Corp., a water company Enron spun off and=
 then repurchased. In all, Enron posted a third-quarter loss of 84 cents a s=
hare, compared with a gain of 34 cents a share in the year-earlier period. R=
evenue rose 59% to $47.6 billion.=20
At 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron's stock was up 67 cents a share to $33.84 in comp=
osite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but remains far below its 52-w=
eek high of $84.88. On Monday, the day before the earnings announcement, Enr=
on stock dropped by about 7%.=20
In an interview, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Lay, said the=
 write-offs were designed as part of an effort to "find anything and everyth=
ing that was a distraction and was causing a cloud over the company."=20
The quarterly loss is the latest in a series of setbacks faced by Enron rece=
ntly after years of almost unbroken success. There have been mounting proble=
ms from expensive moves into the water and telecommunications businesses.=20
And there has been a steady stream of executive departures, most notably the=
 surprise resignation in August of Enron's president and chief executive, Je=
ffrey Skilling, who said he left for personal reasons and because of the fal=
len stock price.=20
The partnership arrangement involving Mr. Fastow, the highly regarded chief =
financial officer, first surfaced in an Enron SEC filing in 1999, but only r=
ecently has it attracted Wall Street's concern. In late July, Mr. Fastow sev=
ered his relations with the partnerships, according to a company SEC filing.=
 Company officials said that move was partly related to questions raised by =
analysts and large Enron shareholders.=20
Little about the inner workings of the LJM partnerships has been disclosed t=
o date. Private partnership documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal in=
dicate that Enron agreed to a partnership arrangement with potentially huge =
financial rewards for Mr. Fastow.=20
The LJM Cayman partnership raised a relatively modest $16 million, according=
 to the documents. The more ambitious LJM2 aimed to raise at least $200 mill=
ion, the documents show. Among investors were Credit Suisse Group's Credit S=
uisse First Boston, Wachovia Corp. and General Electric Co.'s General Electr=
ic Capital Corp. The Arkansas Teachers Fund committed $30 million, of which =
$7.4 million had been tapped by late last month. Bill Shirron, a fund manage=
r there, said the LJM arrangement had "already returned $6 million to us." I=
t's been "a home run so far," Mr. Shirron added.=20
According to the LJM2 offering document, the general partner, made up of Mr.=
 Fastow and at least one other Enron employee, received a management fee of =
as much as 2% annually of the total amounts invested. Additionally, the gene=
ral partner was eligible for profit participation that could produce million=
s of dollars more if the partnership met its performance goals over its proj=
ected 10-year life. In exchange, the general partner was obliged to invest a=
t least 1% of the aggregate capital commitments.=20
In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Lay said the LJM arrangement didn't p=
roduce any conflicts of interest. Such related-party transactions, involving=
 top managers or directors, aren't unusual, he said. "Almost all big compani=
es have related-party transactions."=20
Typically, related-party transactions involve dealings with partly owned aff=
iliates or a contract with a firm tied to one of the company's outside direc=
tors. It is rare for a top executive to be in a position where he could have=
 conflicting fiduciary responsibilities. The LJM2 offering document states t=
hat the responsibilities of Mr. Fastow and other partnership officials to En=
ron could "from time to time conflict with fiduciary responsibilities owed t=
o the Partnership and its partners."=20
Some institutions approached as potential LJM investors demurred partly beca=
use of such potential conflicts.=20
Enron has publicly stated that the partnership deals were aimed to help it h=
edge against fluctuating values for its growing portfolio of assets. In the =
past decade, Enron has seen its asset base rocket to more than $100 billion.=
 As a result of this rapid growth, Enron has at times been strapped for capi=
tal and has sought ways to bring in outside investors to help bolster its ba=
lance sheet.=20
Charles LeMaistre, an outside Enron director and president emeritus of the M=
=2ED. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, said he viewed the =
partnership arrangement partly as a way of keeping Mr. Fastow at Enron. "We =
try to make sure that all executives at Enron are sufficiently well-paid to =
meet what the market would offer," he said.=20
Enron's interest in retaining Mr. Fastow may have been heightened by an exod=
us of top managers who were cashing out large stock-option grants after the =
company's success in 1999 and 2000. Mr. Fastow's yield from options for the =
12 months through Aug. 31 was $4.6 million, according to disclosure reports =
compiled by Thomson Financial. Mr. Lay netted about $70 million from exercis=
ing options during this period, while Mr. Skilling, the former president, re=
alized nearly $100 million.

Enron Reports $1 Billion In Charges And a Loss
By KENNETH N. GILPIN

The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, the nation's leading wholesale electricity marketer a=
nd natural gas trader, posted a third-quarter loss yesterday because of more=
 than $1 billion in one-time charges for various businesses.=20
The company reported a net loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share, in con=
trast to net income of $292 million, or 34 cents a share, in the period a ye=
ar earlier. Excluding charges, Enron said it earned $393 million, or 43 cent=
s a share. Revenue jumped 59 percent, to $47.6 billion, from $30 billion a y=
ear ago.
The charges, which total $1.01 billion, or $1.11 a share, included a $287 mi=
llion write-down on Azurix, the company's troubled water-management division=
, and $180 billion in restructuring charges at its broadband telecommunicati=
ons operation.=20
But more than half the charges were related to various investment losses, mo=
stly from Enron's stake in the New Power Company, a retail electricity joint=
 venture with AOL Time Warner and I.B.M.=20
''After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these c=
harges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings p=
otential of our core energy businesses,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman a=
nd chief executive, said in a statement.=20
Even as its stock surged last year and into this year, analysts complained t=
hat the company had a complex web of businesses and lacked clarity in its fi=
nancial reporting.=20
In the wake of the California energy crisis, the value of Enron shares began=
 a sharp retreat, and the focus on problems at some of its operations intens=
ified.=20
On Aug. 14, Jeffrey K. Skilling abruptly resigned as president and chief exe=
cutive after just six months on the job. The move forced Mr. Lay, who transf=
ormed the company from an intrastate pipeline company into an energy conglom=
erate, to resume operational control.=20
Wall Street had been expecting write-offs, and analysts said more could be c=
oming. But the news yesterday had little effect on Enron's shares, which ros=
e 67 cents, to $33.84. They are off 59 percent this year.=20
''They didn't telegraph exactly what they were going to do, or when or how,'=
' said David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ''But for many quarter=
s the topic has been how many billions are they going to write off? Now the =
question is, 'What's next?' ''=20
Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, said the write-offs were ''a step =
in the right direction.''=20
''Investors can look at this with more confidence that problems are being fa=
ced and addressed,'' he said.=20
Mr. Barone and others said the company might have to make decisions at some =
point about troubled international assets, including its power plant in Indi=
a as well as its broadband unit.=20
Earlier this year, Mr. Skilling insisted that Enron's broadband trading busi=
ness was worth $35 billion. After the restructuring yesterday, Enron has a $=
600 million investment in broadband.=20
''I don't think anyone knows what the broadband operation is worth,'' said T=
odd Shipman, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''It seems to me they don't th=
ink there is a big prospect of a short-term turnaround. They are putting the=
 whole thing in cold storage.''=20
Despite Enron's potential, analysts said Mr. Lay faced a considerable task.=20
''Management has lost credibility and have to reprove themselves,'' Mr. Flei=
scher at Goldman, Sachs said. ''They need to convince investors these earnin=
gs are real, that the company is for real and that growth will be realized. =
That has to be proven over time.''=20
The earnings report issued yesterday provides ''a little more breakdown,'' h=
e added, ''but it will take more disclosure.''

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron tries to see bright side of $1bn le=
vy - DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS FAILED INVESTMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERG=
Y AND WATER TAKE THEIR TOLL.=20
Enron, the US energy trader, yesterday attempted to reassure the market afte=
r it revealed a hefty $1.01bn charge related to its failed investments in te=
lecommunications, retail energy sales and water businesses.
The Houston-based company outlined a recovery plan, including more asset sal=
es, but the charge, along with a weaker-than-expected performance in Europe =
and no sign of improvement in its broadband division overshadowed any good n=
ews.=20
Some analysts, who had exerted pressure on the company to release detailed f=
inancial results, warned of more surprises at an analysts meeting in New Yor=
k tomorrow.=20
Moody's Investors Service placed Enron's $13bn of debt securities on review =
for downgrade. By midday in New York, the company's shares were 17 cents low=
er at $33, continuing a 60 per cent share slide this year.=20
Ken Lay, the chairman who is back at the helm after the abrupt resignation o=
f former chief executive Jeff Skilling in August, said he had three main con=
cerns.=20
Enron remains entangled in the fallout from the California energy crisis, th=
e sale of its troubled Dahol power project in India and the slump in the bro=
adband division, he said.=20
"Investors have been willing to overlook a lack of clarity with Enron but no=
w with more difficult times, they want to dig a little deeper. Enron should =
have been doing that all along," said Chris Ellinghause, analyst at Williams=
 Capital Group.=20
Mr Lay said yesterday that Enron planned to offload other assets after selli=
ng its electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Ga=
s for $1.8bn this month.=20
Mr Lay said that despite the charge, the company had had a strong quarter an=
d the fundamentals remained strong.=20
"There is some optimism for the fourth quarter and for next year. We have cl=
eaned up some operations and hopefully by doing this, we will get a sharper =
focus on the company's true strengths and growth to come."=20
Earlier, Mr Lay revealed a $618m, or 84 cents a share, loss for the quarter,=
 against a profit of $292m, or 34 cents, last time.=20
The charges included $544m for losses on investments in The New Power Compan=
y, broadband and technology investments. The company took a $180m charge to =
restructure its broadband division and a $287m loss related to Azurix, the w=
ater treatment and infrastructure business.=20
Revenue jumped 60 per cent to $47.6bn.=20
The company's main profit driver, its wholesale energy division, had strong =
results in its natural gas and electricity trading, especially in North Amer=
ica.=20
Asked if Enron intended to report any other charges, Mr Lay said: "If we tho=
ught we had other impaired assets they would be on the list today."=20

Excuse me?=20
Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, the US energy group and trader, was in the hot s=
eat yesterday trying to explain a surprise $1bn charge to analysts and the m=
edia on the company's third-quarter conference call when a hapless caller of=
fered some light relief.
"Is this the Duke conference call?" the listener asked, interrupting Lay's e=
xplanation for a hefty third-quarter loss from failed investments in telecom=
munications, retail energy sales and water.=20
(Duke Energy competes head on with the aggressive, Houston-based Enron.)=20
The conference host moved in swiftly: "You are calling about Duke? This is E=
nron's third-quarter call", as much laughter ensued.=20
Then Lay, who has promised to provide analysts with more information about t=
he company, chimed in: "Now if you'd like to ask about Duke, we'll do that t=
oo."=20
Lay's approach was noticeably relaxed - despite the poor result - and unlike=
 that of his predecessor and right-hand man, Jeff Skilling, who quit the com=
pany in August but is still fondly remembered for his use of vivid epithets =
during conference calls.=20

"They spruced up the house, but they didn't actually clean out all the cobwe=

Enron did note three areas still facing uncertainty: ongoing disputes over i=

Coale said she is concerned about further hits to Enron's balance sheet that=
 could lower its credit rating, which is currently of investment-grade quali=

Three separate deals to sell international assets for almost $900 million ar=

MARK TO MARKET: A Defiant Spring In Their Steps
By Jim Murphy

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Insouciance is the word I'm looking for.
Of late, Wall Street seems insouciant, intent on keeping the sunny side up, =
maintaining its cheer in the face of bad news.=20
Tuesday, on the earnings front, there was plenty of bad news - before stock =
markets opened, while they were open and after they closed.=20
For example, more than two hours before the NYSE opened, Enron Corp. reporte=
d its largest quarterly loss ever. But its shares closed with a gain of 67 c=
ents.=20
On the other hand, Enron shares dropped 7% on Monday, which again raises a q=
uestion never far from the minds of those who follow Wall Street: What did w=
hoever know and when did they know it? Which is the interrogatory form of "S=
ome pigs are more equal than others."=20
After the bell Tuesday, IBM reported that third-quarter earnings fell 19% on=
 a 6% decline in sales. No matter. In after-hours trading, in less than two =
hours after the news, IBM shares had gained almost $4.00 each.=20
All the major stock indexes closed higher Tuesday, with one of the most incl=
usive of all, the Russell 2000, rising 1.03%.=20
Corporate earnings releases Wednesday will be even heavier than on Tuesday. =
Many of them will contain bad news. Until, however, we see evidence indicati=
ng otherwise, bet on Wall Street again to respond with insouciance.=20
Not incidentally, economists, analysts, and the financial media all are alik=
e in how we handle a stock's response to bad news. To wit and for example: "=
Enron shares shrugged off an abysmal earnings report Tuesday to post a modes=
t gain of 67 cents each..." or, "Enron shares were toiletized Tuesday after =
the company reported its greatest quarterly loss ever..."=20
In fact, in both cases, we know only that B followed A. We don't know, and n=
ever can know, the relationship between event A and event B. Whatever the re=
lationship(s), it isn't obvious, nor can it be obtained by interviewing ones=
elf.=20
Big Al, Plus Two Nominees To His Committee=20

Everyone is waiting for Uncle Al, the markets' pal, to testify on Capitol Hi=
ll at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).=20
Fed chairman Greenspan will then tell the Joint Economic Committee of Congre=
ss all he deems it appropriate for the public to hear on monetary policy and=
 the U.S. economy, post-Sept. 11.=20
Meantime, professional Fed watchers, who are far fewer in number than amateu=
r Greenspan watchers, will be paying close attention, beginning at 9:30 a.m.=
 EDT (1330 GMT), to a session of the Senate Banking Committee.=20
The panel is holding confirmation hearings for the first two of President Ge=
orge W. Bush's nominations for Federal Reserve Governor. Fed governors are v=
oting members of the rate-setting FOMC.=20
Are these two people, both with backgrounds in commercial banking, interest-=
rate hawks or doves or somewhere in between? That is to say: Are they or are=
 they not preemptive inflation fighters?=20
One of the two, Susan Bies, is executive vice president of First Tennessee N=
ational Corp.=20
The other, Mark Olson, was once the chief executive of a bank in Fergus Fall=
s, Minn., which I would guess is a hometown bank. In 1986-87, Olson was pres=
ident of the American Bankers Association.=20
He was also, get this, a staff member of the Senate Banking Committee, which=
, by golly, is the committee holding the confirmation hearings. Of course, w=
e have no way of knowing whether familiarity bred contempt. Whether, for exa=
mple, Olson became notorious among staffers for not making a fresh pot of co=
ffee after he helped himself to the last cup in the old pot.=20
Both Bies and Olson must be confirmed by the full Senate.=20
Fifth Third=20

The name is bizarre, but the explanation is pedestrian.=20
Early in the previous century, Fifth Bank and Third Bank merged to become Fi=
fth Third Bank.=20
Perhaps the CEOs at the time both had tin ears. Or perhaps each wanted the n=
ame of his bank to survive the marriage.=20
Thanks for the answer to Todd, Brian, David and David.=20
In Tuesday afternoon's column, I wondered about the genesis of a whacky name=
 like Fifth Third Bancorp.=20
And, as Brian notes, "God help us all if they merge with Second National Ban=
k and then Fourth National Bank."=20
OPERATOR: "Second Third Fourth Fifth Bancorp. Can I hep yew?"=20

Enron=20
Enron has entered a new phase in its development: rebuilding credibility. Co=
ncerns about California, India etc have not gone away, but efforts to improv=
e transparency in its financial reporting constitute a real improvement. The=
 momentum of the core wholesale energy trading and marketing business is und=
iminished and recurring net income growth of 35 per cent, before charges, is=
 impressive. But short-term distractions do not make it easy to focus on the=
 long-term growth story.
Attention to the balance sheet is welcome - but the charges are not insubsta=
ntial. The charge for asset impairments at Azurix is hardly surprising given=
 the state of the business. The $180m for restructuring Broadband Services c=
omes on top of another $80m of losses in the quarter. Cutting broadband down=
 to a sensible size is proving expensive. The $544m for losses associated wi=
th "certain other investments" (half relating to New Power) is not the end o=
f the story, not least because broadband investments are still valued at som=
e $600m. Still, asset sales should reduce debt from 50 per cent of total cap=
ital at the end of this year to a more comfortable 40 per cent at the end of=
 2002.=20
Enron's ventures outside energy trading have not been roaring successes. The=
 long-term potential lies in convincing investors that the earnings growth i=
n the core business is real and sustainable. The multiple of 16 times 2002 e=
arnings still suggests that the market is not giving Enron full credit for t=
he prospect of 20 per cent annual earnings growth next year and beyond. Give=
n the noise, that is unsurprising.=20

Brazil Energy Rules Deter Investment as Shortages Choke Economy

Brazil Energy Rules Deter Investment as Shortages Choke Economy

     Sao Paulo, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. built a 400
million-reais ($145 million) electricity plant in Brazil expecting
to sell power to factories that face their biggest energy shortage
in more than 50 years.

     It didn't work out. Government subsidies on existing power-
supply contracts led companies to cut output as much as 20 percent
rather than seek alternative supplies. The Enron plant, fired up
for an opening ceremony Sept. 24, lies idle.

     ``We need prices that reflect the cost of generating
energy,'' said Orlando Gonzalez, president of Enron America do Sul
Ltda., the Brazilian unit of the largest energy trader.

     The obstacles faced by Enron and other utilities mean
Brazil's power industry is unlikely to get the estimated $3.6
billion annual investment it needs to meet growing energy demand.
The country needs to add 6,000 megawatts of capacity every year to
avoid rationing that has forced companies such as Alcoa Inc., an
aluminum maker, to cut energy use 20 percent since June.

     Brazil's energy policy ``is bad because it doesn't create
incentives for companies to build plants,'' said Eduardo Bernini,
president of the Brazilian unit of Electricidade de Portugal SA,
Portugal's biggest power company.

     The energy shortage, the result of inadequate investment in
new power plants combined with a drought that has reduced
hydroelectric output, caused the government to ration supplies to
companies and also to about two-thirds of Brazil's 170 million
population. This, combined with higher interest rates and a
currency that has lost almost a third of its value against the
dollar this year, will cut 2001 economic growth to about 1.6
percent from the 4.5 percent forecast in January, according to
economists' estimates.

                           El Paso Plant

     Enron isn't alone in being unable to sell its power.

     Houston-based El Paso Corp., the largest U.S. natural gas
pipeline owner, may have to idle a 870-megawatt thermoelectric
plant in Macae, Rio de Janeiro state, when it opens Nov. 7. El
Paso, which spent $500 million on the plant, says it has no buyers
for the electricity.

     Some investment already has been delayed. Enron couldn't
raise $600 million in loans to build a second gas-fired plant near
Rio de Janeiro, Gonzalez said. AES Corp., a U.S. power producer
with business in 27 countries, has failed to obtain $1.5 billion
in financing for three gas-fired plants the company plans to build
in Brazil, said Luiz David Travesso, president of the utility's
Brazilian unit.

     Brazilian companies buy most of their energy through long-
term contracts with former state-owned generators and distributors
at prices that are subsidized by the government. On average, they
pay about 40 percent less than it costs to produce energy, said
Electricidade de Portugal's Bernini.

                         Subsidies at Risk

     If companies enter additional long-term contracts to acquire
electricity they lose the subsidies on their existing contracts,
with the result that the cost of all their energy purchases rise.

     Brazil's spot electricity market, created two years ago to
enable manufacturers to cover additional energy needs without
signing long-term contracts, doesn't provide an alternative, said
Enron's Gonzalez.

     Enron abandoned plans to sell energy from its new plant
through the spot market because there were no guarantees it would
be paid, he said.

     The ``market isn't clearing trading, so you don't receive
money,'' said Gonzalez. ``We cannot run the plant without cash.''

     Some companies that sold electricity through the market
haven't paid. Tradener Comercializacao de Energia, controlled by
Cia. Paranaense de Energia, Brazil's second-biggest integrated
utility, has been waiting since April to receive 96 million reais
from energy sales, said Walfrido Victorino Avila, chief executive
of the electricity trading company.

                            Unpaid Bill

     Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, the country's largest
power generator, hasn't paid for electricity purchased through the
spot market last year. A spokesman at the company, which needed
the electricity to cover contracts after construction of its Angra
2 nuclear plant was delayed, said the account will be settled.

     From the consumers' point of view, prices on the spot market
are prohibitively high, said analysts. Prices are established by a
formula that takes into account water levels in reservoirs of
hydroelectric plants, which represent 84 percent of Brazil's
generating capacity. Lower water levels mean higher prices for
electricity on the spot market.

     A drought, which has reduced water levels to the lowest in
nearly 70 years, has caused the market price to soar to three
times what companies pay under long-term contracts, said Marcos
Severine, a power utility analyst at Banco Sudameris SA's
brokerage in Sao Paulo.

     Brazil's government has appointed new management to sort out
the spot market's problems. It has also set up a committee led by
Francisco Gros, president of Brazil's National Development Bank,
to draw up rules to encourage investment in new generating
capacity.

     Utilities are optimistic solutions will be found.
     ``We believe the government is working toward solving the
energy problems Brazil is facing at the moment,'' said Enron's
Gonzalez.

     In the meantime, generators that may help relieve Brazil's
energy crisis stand idle.


Former Montana governor named U.S. envoy in lumber dispute

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush named former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot on T=
uesday as a special envoy to try to broker a settlement in a long-running lu=
mber dispute with Canada.=20
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Commerce Secretary Donald Evan=
s cited Racicot's familiarity with the timber industry and public forests as=
 reasons for his appointment.
"This dispute has endured for decades, and it is our hope that, with the gov=
ernor's help, we can achieve a lasting market-based solution," Evans said.=20
Racicot said in a statement that he was honored and "committed to identifyin=
g a fair and lasting solution."=20
The appointment comes at a critical time in the slow-moving negotiations wit=
h Canada. In two weeks, the Commerce Department is expected to announce its =
decision on whether Canadian companies "dump" softwood lumber on U.S. market=
s at artificially low prices.=20
In a preliminary decision issued in August, the department said too-low Cana=
dian fees give Canada's lumber industry an unfair advantage and suggested a =
19 percent tariff on Canadian lumber.=20
Softwood lumber is used in framing houses. The U.S. homebuilding industry ha=
s said a 19 percent tariff would hurt American consumers by adding up to $1,=
000 to the cost of building a home, but the U.S. lumber industry says the le=
vy is needed to save jobs.=20
Trade representatives have met in long, private sessions in Washington and O=
ttawa in the last six weeks without agreement.=20
Rodney Moore, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy, welcomed Racicot's appoi=
ntment. "It indicates to us the high level of importance that the Bush admin=
istration places on the softwood lumber trade," he said.=20
Racicot, a Republican, was barred by term limits from seeking a third term a=
s Montana's governor last year. He gained national attention as a spokesman =
for Bush during the recount in Florida and was considered for attorney gener=
al but took himself out of the running.=20
He also was discussed as a potential opponent to Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., w=

Enron reports third-quarter loss due to investment writeoff

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp., the nation's top natural gas trader and the lead=
ing wholesale electricity marketer, reported a $638 million third-quarter lo=
ss Tuesday due to a onetime charge.=20
The loss for the July-September period amounted to 84 cents per share.
Without the charge, Enron would have posted a profit of $393 million, or 43 =
cents per share. That matched the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by=
 Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
In the third quarter of 2000, Enron earned $292 million, or 34 cents per sha=
re.=20
Revenue rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in the same period a year ago=
=2E=20
Enron wrote off $1.01 billion in after-tax non-recurring expenses in the qua=

 its New Power Company, broadband and technology investments; $287 million f=
or asset impairments by its Azurix Corp. division, which owns, operates and =
manages water and wastewater systems; and $180 million to restructure its hi=
gh-speed Internet venture.=20
"After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these ch=
arges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings po=
tential of our core energy businesses," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairma=
n and chief executive officer.=20
In August, president and chief executive Jeffrey Skilling unexpectly resigne=
d, citing family reasons, and his duties were taken over by Lay. Enron's sto=
ck had tumbled to a 52-week low as company proclamations that it remains on =
solid footing were met with skepticism on Wall Street.=20
Lay said Tuesday earnings from its ongoing energy and gas pipeline businesse=
s were strong.=20
"The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading m=
arket position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook," he sa=
id.=20
For the first nine months of the year, Enron earned $211 million, or 19 cent=
s a share, down from $919 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. Revenue for=
 the nine months climbed to $139.6 billion from $60.4 billion a year ago.=20

Thanks for joining us. Good to have you back on CNNfn.
KENNETH LAY, CHMN. & CEO, ENRON: It`s nice to be on CNNfn, thank you.=20
SCHAFFLER: I guess we should ask for an explanation first because there were=
 some charges in this earnings report that Wall Street`s still trying to get=
 a handle on. Explain to us why the charges were made and how that`s impacti=
ng most importantly, fourth quarter.=20
LAY: Well, first of all, as to the charges, they related primarily to the Zu=
rich`s water business, our broadband business, and the new power company whe=
re we have investments and assets and those businesses. And we try to clean =
all those up in this quarter since they seemed to be providing quite a bit o=
f distraction to the real quality and strong growth of our core businesses.=20
SCHAFFLER: And let`s talk about the core businesses going forward, because f=
or so long we talked about the broadband component of the business. What`s k=
ey now? what`s most important? what`s driving future growth?=20
LAY: Well, primarily our wholesale business, which is growing very strong, i=
n this most recent quarter, our physical volume deliveries in our wholesale =
business was up about 65 percent. Our earnings were up about 35 percent. Str=
ong growth in our retail business we`re - in fact, we`re the only company pr=
oviding nationwide energy services. And again, that had a strong quarter als=
o, adding about 12,000 new customers. We currently have about 40,000 facilit=
ies where we manage the energy activity for these customers and about 4 bill=
ion square feet of space. And then, of course, finally, our pipeline group, =
which is always just really strong and can get cash flow and earnings.=20
SCHAFFLER: You have not held your position for that long. There has been a c=
hange at Enron that occurred over the summer. What`s been the toughest chall=
enge for you as you sit down and try to figure out which way the company`s h=
eading next?=20
LAY: Well, Rhonda, as you know, I held this position for over 15 years befor=
e Jeff Skilling became CEO in February this year. So I`m basically just kind=
 of reassuming that position when Jeff decided he had to leave for personal =
and family reasons. So I really have not been out of this chair very long. B=
ut I think the main thing is just to continue to grow these very solid, core=
 businesses which in the third quarter this year provided about 35 percent i=
ncrease in net income, to about $400 million and about 26 percent increase i=
n earnings per share. And you`re right, I mean, we reconfirmed our earnings =
for 19 - or 2001 at $1.80, which is what the Street expects, and 2.15 for ne=
xt year. So it will be one more year of about 20 percent growth in earnings =
per share. And we`ve been doing that for the last three or four years.=20
SCHAFFLER: It`s decent growth, especially at a time when the economy, the ex=
perts tell us, is in recession, any worries on your part?=20
LAY: Not really, I`d like to see a stronger economy. And certainly I believe=
 the fiscal stimulus package you just discussed on your program is part of t=
hat. But by the same token, we find that we could continue to perform at ver=
y strong rates even in this somewhat slower economy that we experience right=
 now.=20
SCHAFFLER: And very quickly, because we`re almost out of time, any predictio=
n on the energy markets going forward, it is a tough business when we talk a=
bout commodities?=20
LAY: Well, I think they`ll probably continue to be volatile, just like they =
have been. Certainly the winter weather will determine in large part what ha=
ppens to natural gas prices here over the next couple of months. Beyond that=
, of course, we`ve got a very soft economy worldwide, which is really impact=
ing the oil markets. So I expect it will remain a little sluggish for a whil=
e unless we have a major supply interruption.=20
SCHAFFLER: Kenneth Lay, chairman and CEO at Enron, great to have you back on=
, good to see you again.=20
LAY: Thank you, Rhonda.=20
SCHAFFLER: Congrats on the quarter.=20

Enron CEO - Interview
Neil Cavuto

10/16/2001
Fox News: Your World
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Tell me what you think is wrong with this picture: Bombs =
dropping, oil prices dropping. The oil prices dropping part is the strange t=
hing. True enough, but in case you`re thinking things stay that way, the cha=
irman of energy giant Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) has a warning for =
you: Don`t necessarily count on it.=20
I caught up with Kenneth Lay earlier today and got his take on where we go f=
rom here.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
KENNETH LAY, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ENRON: Well, I think what`s primarily happening=
 there, of course, is the economy. I mean, the economy worldwide -- the worl=
dwide economy is so weak that we`re seeing demand off quite a bit, and of co=
urse, in the U.S. you`re seeing a lot less travel by, probably the U.S. and =
elsewhere, but a lot less travel.=20
So I think unless you have an interruption or a major curtailment by the OPE=
C producers oil prices could stay kind of soft for a while.=20
CAVUTO: So you don`t see that curtailment happening, or even, for example, s=
omething more orchestrated, like a production cut?=20
LAY: No, I think that could happen, but I think it would take something like=
 that to turn it around just because of the demand situation.=20
CAVUTO: Do you find it, though, surprising, before we get to your earnings, =
that this is happening as bombs are falling over there? Normally just the op=
posite occurs.=20
LAY: Yeah, but the bombs thus far are not calling where the oil is. Now, tha=
t would change it enormously if the bombs started falling somewhere close to=
 some major production.=20
CAVUTO: All right. Let`s talk a little bit about, you know, you beat Street =
estimates, some of these numbers. You managed a rebound in your stock from w=
here we were when Jeff Skilling left. But there are a lot of concerns out th=
ere as to whether you ever revisit those heady days of 84, 85 dollars a shar=
e. What say you?=20
LAY: Well, I think we will, but it`ll take a little bit of time. I mean, I t=
hink, at the same token that we may not see 80 to 90 dollar prices for a whi=
le, I think by most valuation techniques, why, we`re certainly still worth a=
 lot more than 33, 34 dollars when we have the kind of strong earnings growt=
h we`ve been demonstrating in our core businesses=20
CAVUTO: Does it bug you, Ken, that no one makes a big deal of it when your s=
tock is in the dumper, but everyone was coming after you and demanding energ=
y roll-backs and that sort of thing when you were sky-high?=20
LAY: That`s true. Of course, I guess you`re speaking primarily on the Califo=
rnia situation.=20
CAVUTO: Right.=20
LAY: And certainly, our shareholders -- and Enron, too -- would have been a =
lot better off had the California situation never occurred. And we did our b=
est to try to help them solve that problem, but at least back in the early d=
ays of the problem, why, there didn`t seem much interest in trying to solve =
it. They just wanted to find somebody to blame it on.=20
CAVUTO: You know, a lot of the power trading activity in this country was cu=
t off right after the September 11th attacks. I don`t remember, in the case =
of Enron, for how long. But can you update us on that?=20
LAY: Well, as a matter of fact, we did close down early on September 11th, b=
ut our people were back working the next morning at 7 o`clock. I think, that=
 first day, we only stayed in business or at least kept Enron online and in =
business for about half a day, but by the day after that, we were back into =
full business. And so we -- we`ve really had very little interruption becaus=
e of September the 11th.=20
CAVUTO: Now, I know you`re very close to the Bush administration and to the =
President Bush himself, and the president, of course, is trying to sell the =
American people on the notion that this could be a multi-year effort. Is the=
 corporate community on board with that?=20
LAY: Oh, I think we are. I think right now virtually all Americans are on bo=
ard for that. And I think the main reason is that we understand the alternat=
ive. I mean, we just cannot continue to live in fear of these terrorist atta=
cks.=20
CAVUTO: But do you worry that as a major oil player yourself that the boomer=
ang, at least from the Middle East, is on you guys, that you look to be in t=
he hip pocket of the administration, so bash those guys, penalize those guys=
, make life difficult for those guys?=20
LAY: There may be some of that, but certainly we don`t see that having any -=
- any adverse impact on our businesses, and as you know, Neil, we`re much, m=
uch larger in natural gas and electricity in Europe and North America than w=
e are oil out of the Middle East.=20
CAVUTO: And we should stress that with the 6 percent increase in natural gas=
 bonds, a 77 percent surge in power lines, this is a very different story.=20
Having said that, though, the recession word is constantly banded about. It`=
s something that stays with us a while. What do you say?=20
LAY: I -- I think we`ll come out of it next year. I can`t say if it`s going =
to be the second quarter or their quarter or maybe even fourth quarter, alth=
ough I`d probably pick one of the earlier quarters versus the later quarters=
=2E=20
But again, we -- we`ve shown, this most recent quarter, where the economy wa=
s very soft, gas and electricity prices were pretty low, that, in fact, we c=
an still make very good money even in a slow economy.=20
CAVUTO: All right. Now, when Jeff Skilling left after only six months on the=
 job as your president and CEO, your (UNINTELLIGIBLE) successor, they brough=
t you back. As I was joking before we came on here, bring back Yoda. But the=
re`s a concern that there isn`t much depth after you, Ken. I don`t mean to b=
esmirch your lieutenants. But there is a concern that after you it is slim p=
ickings. How can you assure Wall Street that`s not the case?=20
LAY: Well, it`s really quite the contrary. I will say, Neil, that I have the=
 strongest management team now than I`ve ever had at Enron, and I`ve had som=
e pretty strong teams, as you know. Going back over 15 years, I`ve never had=
 the bench strength or depth that I have right now.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
CAVUTO: All right. Kenneth Lay of Enron.=20

Enron Corp. CHMN. & CEO - Interview
Bob Pisanti (?)

10/16/2001
CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

BOB PISANTI, CNBC ANCHOR, MARKET WATCH: Lets take a look at shares of energy=
 trader Enron. They were trading lower the last I checked. Let`s see what it=
 is. Yes, off $0.18. But you could see it was higher early going but then so=
ld off at $32.91 now. Profits for the third quarter came in before the bell,=
 $0.43 a share. That was in line with estimates. As of this morning, there w=
ere 18 analysts covering it. Thirteen say it`s a "strong buy," three a "mode=
rate buy," two a "hold." Nobody is selling it.=20
And joining us now from his company headquarters in Houston is Kenneth Lay. =
He`s Chairman and CEO of Enron. Good morning, sir.
KENNETH LAY, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ENRON CORP.: Good morning, Bob.=20
PISANTI: Tell me what your feel is on the numbers. You sold off a little bit=
 today and there is also something I want that get to regarding, from Moody`=
s. But what`s your feel of the lay of the land, if you will?=20
LAY: Well, first of all, we had a very strong third quarter. Our overall net=
 income was up about 35 percent, so just a little bit less than $400 million=
 after tax. Our earnings per share were up about 26 percent. Of course right=
 on the Street`s expectations. We had very strong growth in volumes, about 6=
5 percent. Our retail business showed a very strong quarter with income befo=
re interest and taxes up about three and a half fold. So we had a good stron=
g quarter. Now, we did take some write-offs to kind of clean up some balance=
 sheet items and I am sure that that`s being evaluated. But overall we`re ve=
ry pleased with it, particularly given the current economy.=20
KPISANTI: Tell me about, for folks that aren`t familiar with it, you trade e=
nergy, explain how that works.=20
LAY: Well, basically we buy and sell energy but it`s even more than that, Bo=
b. We buy and sell natural gas and electricity primarily, but we also arrang=
e physical delivery of the product. So it`s not just a matter of making mark=
ets in the commodity, but it`s also delivering the commodity to the wholesal=
e or retail customer. And, of course, we also provide risk management servic=
es. We provide long term contracts. We have a lot of structured financings t=
hat we provide for our customers. So it`s really kind of a whole portfolio o=
f services, energy services and financial services, that we provide for our =
customers.=20
PISANTI: Your stock has been higher over the past 12 months. It is trading c=
loser to its lows. Is there a reflection there as far as what has gone on wi=
th the California market?=20
LAY: Well, I think the California market and all of the noise or publicity t=
hat came out of that certainly didn`t help us at all. Probably also broadban=
d. We have a fairly significant broad -- we had a fairly significant broadba=
nd activity where we had a lot of value in the stock was attributed to that.=
 And I think you and everybody else knows what`s happened to the broadband b=
usiness this year. But certainly all the negative comments out in California=
 didn`t help us. Now that problem is beginning to work itself out and, indee=
d, we think it will work itself out over the next few months.=20
PISANTI: Now Moody`s this morning is placing your long term debt obligations=
 on review for downgrade. They`re concerned about a number of things. Withou=
t going into a great deal of detail, I think they are basically concerned, n=
umber one, the exposure to the California energy market, as well as some of =
the areas where maybe it`s not as energy focused and you`re getting into som=
e areas maybe it`s not your expertise. What`s your response to them?=20
LAY: well, I think first of all, as far as California, we think we`re more t=
han adequately reserved for California. As I said, the regulatory decisions =
out in California as well as Washington are beginning to kind of solve that =
problem. So I think that problem will be resolved fairly soon. Now, let me s=
ay Moody`s did, in fact, put us on review, but also Standard & Poor`s and Fi=
tch did not. They`ve maintained the credit ratings right where they are and =
said stable outlook. So you have some disagreement here among the rating age=
ncies. But I think even the Moody`s pointed out that with the closing of our=
 Portland General transaction, our balance sheet will be back even in strong=
er shape than it is, or was before the write-offs.=20
PISANTI: How does the next year look for you, sir?=20
LAY: Next year looks good. We did reconfirm in our earnings release this mor=
ning that we expect to hit the fourth quarter numbers that we have been proj=
ecting and $1.80 for this year and $2.15 next year. So, again, about another=
 20 percent growth in earnings per share for next year.=20
PISANTI: well, good luck to you, sir.=20
LAY: Thank you very much.=20
PISANTI : Thanks for being with us. This is Ken Lay. He`s Chairman and CEO o=
f Enron.=20
