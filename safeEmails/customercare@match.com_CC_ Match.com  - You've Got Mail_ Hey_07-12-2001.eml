Hello again,

MAN, two emails in just as many days!  What's gotten into you, did you fall =
and hit your head?  Anyway I do enjoy them and don't worry I won't hold you =
to this routine.

No new news to report today, only a list of the casualties; over 5,000 out o=
f 7,500 in Houston and 1,100 out of 1,500 in Enron Europe.....ALL GONE!  The=
 people in our London office have the best story so far.  They were given th=
eir last paycheck on Friday, laid off, and because Enron had arranged for th=
eir housing told they would be evicted from their homes in two weeks, and th=
at they needed to find their own way back to the States.(That's a long sente=
nce) Now that's strictly rumor, but that's how we are getting all our inform=
ation, and it normally turns out to be ture.  Unlike all the BS our manageme=
nt is spraying.

So we have been out talking to the local folks about life after Enron.  It's=
 actually very promising.  I think we can relocate our whole group of 5 pret=
ty easily.  In fact we think we have almost 10 job prospects and so far 3 ou=
t of 3 would hire the whole group.  Two of us are under contract so we can't=
 do anything until they release us but that may be just a matter of time.

I think I'm taking Friday off and going skiing.  I bought new skis and just =
picked them up last night, so I really want to go!  These skis are a little =
longer than I wanted, 190's vs 187's, but what's 3 centimeters anyway.  That=
's a rhetorical question, don't answer that.

I'll let you go for now, but know I want to hear your story.  Or at least wh=
at your willing to tell.

Paul
