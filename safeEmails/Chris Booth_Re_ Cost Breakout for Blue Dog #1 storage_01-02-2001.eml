Matt,

Why do I have to pay for the cranes at GE's factory to get the turbine on a=20
rail car?  Section 10.2 1 states that the Seller shall be responsible for=20
loading Purchaser's mode of transportation upon arrival to the Delivery Poin=
t.

Also, I would expect crane would also be available at New Port News (major=20
shipyard) and Houston to off-load the turbine and or generator.

Chris

In response to your inquiry, the following is the cost breakout for the GE=20

$50,000 =3D Long Term Preservation Procedures on the GTG
$198, 000 =3D Transportation to the storage yard (contract ref: Exhibit N-1)
$78,500 =3D Handling Costs (cranes) to upload on the method of transportatio=
n
$78,500 =3D Handling Costs (cranes) to offload in the storage yard
$64,000 =3D Storage costs through 30 JUN 01 (16k per month for MAR, APR, MAY=
, &=20
JUN)

TOTAL =3D $469,000

Costs that are incurred "up-front" are 1,2,3,& 4.  After discussing this wit=
h=20
GE, this is their Lump Sum price.
