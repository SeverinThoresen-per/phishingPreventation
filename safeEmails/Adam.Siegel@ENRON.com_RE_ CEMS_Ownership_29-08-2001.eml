Ah yes, the old CEMS file.  Unfortunately there is not fast way to update it=
=2E  The information can be found in Powerdat, and in other various industry=
 publications (if a company or plant gets acquired), SEC filings, etc.  Be c=
areful if you change the file, the program that generates the SO2 reports us=
es it, and the format has to be the same for the program to read it.  Also, =
the ATS sheet has to be changed accordingly otherwise the allowance accounts=
 won't match the emissions.  If you need help, feel free to give me a call, =
or the guy in IT who wrote the code for the program is Wade Wells, he knows =
the technical stuff if the program stops working.  Trevor tells me the crane=
s didn't work out, but it doesn't seem to much matter with the compliance da=
te pushed back to 2004.  We'll get 'em on the next one.

Adam,

The CEMS ownership file under the SO2_Reprot folder.  Where did you get that=
