Alan and Wayne:
We received a letter from AEP Energy Services Inc. terminating all coal tran=
sactions with ENA as of 12/1.  The letter states that they shall begin liqui=
dating the contracts on 12/3.  We have been instructed by Sally Beck's group=
 to identify any terminated transactions that should be taken out of the boo=
k.  Should these and if so, which transactions are these?=20
