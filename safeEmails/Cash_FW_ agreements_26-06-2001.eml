Michelle, this note is in response to the 28% tax rate that is attributed to=
 paying out employment agreements. In order to move forward on exploring sol=
utions, Janice needs a blank employment agreement.  Can you help?

iew?  The sooner the better.  I have also contacted EBS and asked them to se=
nd me a copy of one of their agreements (with no names) for John's review.
Thanks,
Janice

Janice,

Can you give me more information avout the agreement given in lieu of severa=
nce pay.  What are the terms of the agreement?  What is paid to the former e=
mployee under the agreement?  What is the timing of these payments?  Are the=
y paid in the same year the employee terminates?  I will need more informati=
on as to the nature of the proposed agreement and its terms before I can rea=
ch an answer on this.  Do you have a copy of this agreement?

Thanks,

John

John,
I have been approached by HR with the following request which I would like y=
our input.
When an employee is being terminated HR is giving them an agreement instead =
of severance pay.  The question is can it be taxed by the W-4 or does it hav=
e to be taxed as supplemental pay.=20
My understanding is if an employee receives payments from an employer that a=
re not part of their ordinary wages, it is considered supplemental wages and=
 if the payment has been clearly indicated as other than ordinary wages it i=
s taxed at the flat 28% (which will soon be 27.5%).
I would appreciate your input as to whether we could set up an agreement ele=
ment in the system and tax it at the W-4 rate and not have any tax issues do=
wn the road that Enron could be held accountable, and what regulation could =
we use for support.
Thanks
Janice
