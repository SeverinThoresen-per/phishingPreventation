How do you feel about offering clearing services on EOL?  It would be a tric=
ky cash issue for Enron, but given our credit situation, it might become mor=
e necessary in order to keep large counterparties on the site.  Our discussi=
ons with Nymex have touched on the idea, and I wanted to get your thoughts.
