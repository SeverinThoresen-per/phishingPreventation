I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someon=
e coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with =
Wes and see what we can suggest.=20

With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Wha=
lley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some t=
hings for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there=
 could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to =
go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focus=
ed on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30=
 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like =
for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly me=
et with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our pro=
cesses, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also=
 count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Ne=
tco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there. =20

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before=
 she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as=
 our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org=
 charts.=20

Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that w=
as before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and =
I don't know where though.  Any thoughts?

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate =
with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob=
 in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be cons=
istent with commercial on this for the org charts. =20

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively fro=
m him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conv=
ersation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have a=
n alternative plan under way.  --Sally=20

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with re=
gards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the d=
eadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise=09
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detai=
led responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. =20
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to J=
anuary 14, 2002.=09
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen=20
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amort=
ized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on f=
loors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look =
to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring arou=
nd January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thu=
rsday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday=
, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco pe=
rsonnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a contin=
ual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsib=
ility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communi=
cation issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and =
what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of y=
ou on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate on=
ce we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good i=
dea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise
