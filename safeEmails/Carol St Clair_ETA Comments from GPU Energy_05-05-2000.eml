GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:

1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the=20
legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the=20
second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf=20
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper=
=20
exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for th=
e=20
Website password?]

2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a=
=20
similar indemnity.


I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?

Carol
