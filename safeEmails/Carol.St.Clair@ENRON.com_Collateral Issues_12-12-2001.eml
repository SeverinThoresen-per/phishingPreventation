Debbie and Tanya:
I thought it might be helpful to summarize how certain of the collateral pro=
visions in our trading agreements are impacted by the filing of bankruptcy:

1.	ISDA Credit Support Annex - Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties =
do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Defaul=
t, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an E=
arly Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment o=
bligation exists.  In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash=
 or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC=
's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us.

2.	Industrial Master - same as above except that the limitation on holding c=
ollateral only applies to cash.

3.	Annex B - the Event of Default/Early Termination Date conditions only app=
ly to requests to reduce collateral, not to a demand to post collateral.  Th=
ere is no QI requirement for holding collateral.


4.	EEI Master (without new collateral annex attached)- no conditions precede=
nt in the EEI to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requiremen=
t for holding collateral.  The new collateral annex works like the ISDA Cred=
it Support Annex except  that the limitation on holding collateral only appl=
ies to cash


5.	Enfolio Master Purchase and Sale Agreement -  no conditions precedent in =
the Enfolio to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requirement =
for holding collateral.

Hope this helps.  Call me if you have any questions.=20
