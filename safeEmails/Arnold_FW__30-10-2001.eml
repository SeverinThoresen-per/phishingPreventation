   Bank of Montreal would like to take Enron up on the offer you made this
   afternoon to help balance our short swap exposure with your organization
   and
   replace it with a third party Enron may have offsetting transactions
   with.
   Per our conversation, to offset the contracts that we are short to
   Enron,
   our position would allow us to accommodate the following transactions:

   Buying five and a half (5.5) contracts a day December 2001 (Z01) natural
   gas
   last day swaps from Enron and selling to a third party
   Buying sixteen and a half (16.5) contracts a day January 2002 through
   December 2002 (F02-Z02) natural gas last day swaps from Enron and
   selling to
   a third party
   Buying four (4) contracts a day April 2003 through October 2003
   (J03-V03)
   natural gas last day swaps from Enron and selling to a third party
   Buying two (2) contracts a day January 2004 through December 2008
   (F04-Z08)
   natural gas last day swaps from Enron and selling to a third party
