Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on =
to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me=20

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL trans=
port (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand=
 for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy=
 price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  =
Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( =3D 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I w=
ould calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP=
1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 11=
47662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 ye=
ars of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting =
that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?
