Kent,

I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.

I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some re=
gards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our =
Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to t=
he report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two=
 months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that =
we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that=
 decision if you guys collectively agree.

Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than t=
ry to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for g=
as logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the phys=
ical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this ex=
ercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to mar=
keting.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from=
 day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.

Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it. =20

Shelley,

The changes are an improvement.  Both Jo and I were thinking that we were mo=
ving toward having a summary section where the system-wide balance was addre=
ssed.  This would include things such as a summary receipt/delivery balance,=
 how gas is moving across the system at key pipeline points, how much capaci=
ty (such as at Clifton) that is used for transport vs. contract storage vs. =
operational storage (line pack changes).

Also, we were looking for some longer term trend information such as what we=
re the zones in the Market Area and other key points were using last year so=
 we can see the year-on-year trends.

We find ourselves talking about specific volumes at specific points and we f=
eel that it would add a broader feel as to what is happening on the system i=
f we can start with a broader look at the entire system and then move into m=
ore of a location by location/point information.  These were some of the thi=
ngs that we wanted to sit down and talk about to be sure that were all on th=
e same page.  Could we plan on getting together after Lynn's brown-bag lunch=
 presentation (about 1:30)?

Thanks,

Kent

Thanks.  I got your voice message.=20

 I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major =
formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can wal=
k away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm c=
oncerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & diffe=
rences in preferences of formatting style.
