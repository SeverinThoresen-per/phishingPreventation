Mark:
Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:

1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work=20
with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules=20
whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may b=

2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of=20
Liability sections of both Schedules?
