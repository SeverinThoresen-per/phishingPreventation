A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there=20
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him=20
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was =20
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he=
 =20
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his =20
surprise, the Donkey came in third.=20

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows".=
=20
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race=20
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass,=20
out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the=20
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed=20
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."=20

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get ri=
d=20
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent.=
=20
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town."=20

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to =20
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy=20
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."=20
They buried the Bishop the next day.
