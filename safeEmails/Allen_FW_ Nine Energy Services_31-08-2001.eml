Matt,
As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine =
Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Min=
ority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be ap=
proved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we trans=
act, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e=
=2E San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to s=
econdary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transact=
ions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA ha=
s with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions.=20

Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy.=
 In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Wat=
ch Counterparty.
