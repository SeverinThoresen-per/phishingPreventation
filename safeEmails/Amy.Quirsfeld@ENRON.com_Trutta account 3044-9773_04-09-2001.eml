We have new procedures with Treasury concerning our Trutta accounts -=20
Stacy and I use to manage these accounts, but now are having to go through T=
reasury to reserve funds.
They are managing our balances, but will need to know about any same day wir=
es.  If you
have a same day wire going out on the 3044-9773 account please fax Treasury =
to reserve the funds.
This is for same day wires only, all other wires that go through AP and Trea=
sury they are already aware of.
Feel free to ask me if you have any questions. Thanks for your help. =20

Amy
