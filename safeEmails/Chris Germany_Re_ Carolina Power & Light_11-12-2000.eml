Chris, thanks for the help on Friday.

I got two numbers from Tammi De Paolis.  In her voice message she referred t=
o=20
these numbers as meter numbers and then later as transfer point numbers so=20
I'm not sure which they are.  One number is 6562 and the other is 6068=20
(Public Serv. NC).

=46rom this information can you determine whether these points are on the=20
Transco mainline or a lateral off the mainline?

Thanks
