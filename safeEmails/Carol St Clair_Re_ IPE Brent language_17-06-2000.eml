Souad/Sheetal,

Do not revise these deals.  Show this language to our Crude guys.  We have=20
had a problem recently with the below.  The "Common Pricing" clause below=20
would mean that when IPE is closed then the price Platt's publishes that day=
=20
would be void.  Our guys do not like that ideology.  Therefore, check with=20
them before doing this.  Also, we should get approval from legal before usin=

the below.

Joe
