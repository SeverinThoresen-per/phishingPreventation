omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or=20
contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC=20
trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement=

and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before=20
