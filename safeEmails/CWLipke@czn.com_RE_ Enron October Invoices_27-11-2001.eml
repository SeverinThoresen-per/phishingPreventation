Megan,

I'm sorry for the delay...  I've been working hurriedly on the Colorado
invoicing first as I've been directed.  My holdup now is the PSCo invoice
from Theresa Staab (or Paul Lucci since Theresa's out 'til Wednesday) in
ENRON's Denver office.  As soon as I get that finished I can get Arizona
done.  Probably late today if I can get that PSCo invoice this morning.

-Craig

Craig:
I just wanted to check to see if you have had a chance to review the
file I sent to you for October.  I will not be in the office next week
and I need to send the invoices out before I leave.

Also,  I am still working on the CIG issue for prior months.  I have two
more months of invoices to review and am waiting to hear back from our
Denver office on the volume reconciliation.  Have you received any wire
detail from your payable department?  It would really help in finding
the cash that belongs to the CIG invoices.  Since all points were paid
together and sporadically, it is very difficult to confirm that the CIG
invoices were paid in full.  I appreciate your help and patience in this
matter.

Megan
