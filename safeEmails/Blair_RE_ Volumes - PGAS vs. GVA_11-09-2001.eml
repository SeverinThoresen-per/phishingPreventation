Gary, was wondering if you could let us know when these volumes will be corr=
ected because of the rounding.  As I'm sure you know, we are starting to get=
 more calls from our customers and we would like to reassure them that this =
problem will be corrected soon.

Thanks,

Raetta

Chris,
Gary Anderson has implemented a change request for reporting volumes to the =
customer. The requested change would have the volume statements round the sa=
me as the daily extract files.
There won't be adjustments made for the June volumes, instead, when the chan=
ge goes in, the volume statements in June will reflect the rounded volume.
I don't know the exact time estimate for this change but it won't be in befo=
re the July close. You will be hearing more about this in the future.
Thanks to ya'll for being so patient with us.
Jeff

Gary,
I hope I have stated this correctly and if you have any comments they would =
be greatly appreciated.

Subject:	Volume's Pgas vs. GVA

Jeff,

Last month  after our Commodity close NNG has had customers calling with dif=
ferences in the volumes we reported verses the volumes that Gas Measurement =
reported for the month of June 2001.  I think you are aware there  is a roun=
ding issue with the volumes due to the decimals in the new PGAS system.  I d=
on't know if this problem has been resolved or not but since July's close is=
 quickly approaching I was wondering if you could give me the status on this=
 problem and also if there will be adjustments made to the June volumes in P=
GAS to reflect the same volumes that we reported to our Customers? We apprec=
iate all the efforts that you and Gas Measurement have made to make this tra=
nsition period as smooth as possible,  thanks  for your assistance and I'm l=
ooking forward to hearing from you.

Chris Greaney=20
