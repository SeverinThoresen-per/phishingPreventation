EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=B7	Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate
=B7	SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy


California Senate & SoCal's Fate=20
With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Bu=
rton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively pow=
erful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's a=
mendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead =
revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced=
 a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been =
gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:

=B7	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorpora=
te a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (for=
merly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored clos=
er to 120 kv.
=B7	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission ass=
ets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from t=
he sale to their parent company.
=B7	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place=
 by 2010. =20
=B7	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.
=B7	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2=
=2E9B to $2.5B. =20
=B7	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact=
 language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, =
however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exi=
t fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shi=
fting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening caref=
ully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling i=
f direct access is included.)

It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats an=
d will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on =
the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov.=
 Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to v=
ote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effe=
ctively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (=
because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burde=
ns residential consumers with excessive rates) are "optimistic" about the bi=
ll's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly concei=
vable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate =
bailout package for the Assembly's approval.

Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the h=
ours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce=
 the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill=
 passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the b=
ill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that =
if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opp=
osition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote=
 count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the b=
ill into the early hours of Saturday morning.=20

Inside Edison=20
There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, So=
Cal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a genera=
tor, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the num=
ber of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely =
to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a =
plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, t=
he DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for =
power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The t=
otal amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the gen=
erators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a =
deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, thi=
s will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing agains=
t SoCal.

SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to inclu=
de any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate comp=
onent, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inabilit=
y to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate b=
ase is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too h=
igh.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the sta=
te to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power. =20

SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from=
 the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an addition=
al $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary =
bankruptcy petition.=20
