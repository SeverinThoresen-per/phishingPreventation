Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG=20
isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have=20
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we=20
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the=20
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the=20
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

Thanks, Bob
