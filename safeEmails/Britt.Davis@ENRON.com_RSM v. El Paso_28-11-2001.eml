	This will update you on the matters discussed during the joint defense conf=
erence call held this afternoon:

	1.  One defendant group has approached the plaintiff's lead attorney regard=
ing a non-suit prior to the December 5 deadline for moving, answering or oth=
erwise pleading, but has heard nothing.  Others intend to do so before Decem=
ber 5 as well.  I am trying to quickly wrap up my due diligence on Intratex,=
 and once that is done, plan to approach the plaintiffs for a non-suit of at=
 least Enron Corp. and, depending on the results of the due diligence, on In=
tratex as well.  EGM has still not been served to our knowledge.

	2.  After discussion, counsel for the defendant holding companies have agre=
ed to file on December 5 bare-bones motions to transfer venue to Harris Coun=
ty, with the intention of waiving them if plaintiffs appear disposed to push=
 back on them.  This is because of the problem I mentioned in my earlier e-m=
ail today with a venue challenge opening the defendants up to discovery on t=
he merits of the "in concert" allegations.  I will be drafting a proposed mo=
tion to transfer venue for at least Enron Corp., and will circulate it among=
 the defendants for them to use as a guide.  I may also draft a motion to se=
ver (one is arguably necessary for a motion to transfer venue to be effectiv=
e in a case like this), although it too would be bare-bones.  One of the thr=
ee required grounds for a motion to sever is that the severed and the remain=
ing causes must not be so intertwined as to involve the same facts and issue=
s.  Accordingly, I see pursuing a motion to sever on behalf of Enron Corp. t=
o be highly problematic as well.   =20

	3.   All agreed to join in a motion to require Grynberg to show authority. =
 I have previously e-mailed you a draft prepared by F&J.  We see no downside=
 to filing it and considerable upside, such as using it at least to block di=
scovery by Grynberg until it is resolved.  Please let me know if I have your=
 authority to sign the motion.  It will be filed no earlier than December 6,=
 and expressly subject to earlier-filed motions to transfer venue.

	4.  I will be working on a plea to the jurisdiction, answer, and affirmativ=
e defenses to file on behalf of Enron Corp and Intratex, subject to any moti=
on to transfer venue, and will circulate them to you for your review and app=
roval.  During the conference call, I raised the issue of adding a special e=
xception to the effect that the petition fails to state a claim, which is th=
e proper procedural vehicle for what is essentially a Rule 12(b)(6) motion u=
nder the Texas Rules.  One attorney expressed concern that filing a special =
exception could be viewed as somehow prejudicing a motion to transfer venue.=
  As you can clearly raise a special exception later, we decided not to incl=
ude a special exception in the pleadings we were filing on December 5.  We c=
an always file it later.

	5.   On Friday, November 30, at 1:30 p.m ., there will be another joint def=
ense conference call.  The discussion will be centered around whether Lazaro=
 was able to find any retainer agreement between the Zapata County Independe=
nt School District and RSM (we only have a contract between Zapata County an=
d RSM).  If Lazaro is unable to find a properly-filed contract, that may in =
itself be a breach of the Texas Open Meetings Act, and an additional ground =
for our motion to challenge authority.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt
