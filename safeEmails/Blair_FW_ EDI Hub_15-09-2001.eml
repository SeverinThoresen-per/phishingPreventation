The EDI Hub Operations group is implementing a new system for the Team EDI w=
eb page.  The move to production is planned to begin on Saturday, September =
15th at 6:00 p.m. and should be complete around 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, Septemb=
er 16th.  EDI files will continue to be processed until 11 p.m.  At that tim=
e, there will be a total disruption of EDI service until Sunday morning at 3=
 a.m.  Paging will still be in effect until 11 p.m.  To verify that all EDI =
files have been processed Saturday evening, please page the EDI production s=
upport pager at 713.327.3893.  The oncall person for the EDI Hub is Sanjay a=
nd he will have access to outstanding file information.  Also, I can be page=
d at 800.506.0472. =20

To access the new Team EDI system on Sunday morning, continue to use the lin=
ks/addresses, logon IDs and passwords that you use today.  The new system wi=
ll look like the current system, but will have a couple of enhancements that=
 will be discussed in a later memo.

If you have any questions, please e-mail me or page me.
