Hi Kate,

Firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him.  Sharad=
=20
seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected.  He asked me=20
some questions about the "bonus culture" at Enron and suggested that it was=20
not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with.  I sold him=
=20
on the value he can extract from the excellence within the Research Group an=
d=20
the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in, but he=20
still seemed reticent saying that he "needs time" which I understood to mean=
=20
that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere.  He is a great candidate=20
and it would be a real shame to lose him, given the difficulty of getting=20
good candidates.

I discussed this with Vince and given how much we need him in Research in=20
London and Vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarante=
e=20
or sign on to help him make the right decision.

I think Vince will call you or Dale to discuss this.

Regards,

Anjam
