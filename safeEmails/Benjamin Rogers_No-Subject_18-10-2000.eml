Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business=20
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, =
I=20
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron. =
=20
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I=
=20
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of=20
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas tha=
t=20
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or=20
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful. =20
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not=20
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance=20
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another=20
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the=
=20
hopes of increasing my quantitative score. =20
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.=
 =20
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to=20
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean=20
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as m=
y=20
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me ge=
t=20
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their=20
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham, =20
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this=20
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into=20
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the=20
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forwar=
d=20
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers
