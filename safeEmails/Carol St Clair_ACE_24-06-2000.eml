Guys:
Here is where I understand Bill came out on the 6.1(a) issue that we were=20
discussing.  ACE agreed to insert language that would carve out "publicly=20
available" information, but with respect to all other information that would=
=20
be covered by 6.1(a) and the Right of Recovery section, they would not agree=
=20
to limit the Enron group.
