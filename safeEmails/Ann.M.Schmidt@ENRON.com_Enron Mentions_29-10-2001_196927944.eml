Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded =

Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day tradin=

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow=
 much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a =
report issued on Monday.=20
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review f=
or downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it=
 put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second qua=
rter.=20
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgr=
ade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgra=
de by 8.2-to-1.=20
"Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particula=
rly weak for credit rating changes," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior econ=
omist. "A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the t=
hird quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early =
next year."=20
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they a=
re not a "lagging" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate =
credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months.=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the=
 weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, d=
ebt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such i=
ndustries as airlines, insurance, and travel.=20
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after=
 the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV =
operations.=20
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s rating=
s because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplane=
s.=20
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculativ=
e-grade, or "junk"-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For i=
nvestment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11.=20
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 4=
7 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy=
 trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another=
 downgrade.=20
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because in=
terest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more co=
nservatively.=20
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing =
costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business=
 revenues," he said. "That is a positive for credit quality."=20
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades out=
paced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the st=
ock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some=
 bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a "death spiral" for North America's premier energy trading =
company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an a=
lmost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the v=
iability of Cisco.=20
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself a=
s a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets=
 - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibili=
ty is in question.=20
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity i=
n the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can =
touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a com=
mitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market ge=
ts tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, t=
hen, credibility at every level is critical.=20
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light s=
trategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the=
 third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-hea=
vy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successf=
ully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infra=
structure.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting f=
rom $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however=
=2E In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news.=20
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or "shar=
eholders' equity," by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions i=
n partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That,=
 along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and a=
n inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion d=
rop in Enron's market value.=20
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rat=
ing on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving i=
t two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch=
 for further downgrade.=20
Long-Running Concerns=20

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% red=
uction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of =
additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron exec=
utives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them,=
 but few on the call believed that.=20
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about =
the company's lack of financial disclosure.=20
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a "sell" reco=
mmendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firm=
s, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in=
 brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and th=
e company doesn't invest in the securities it covers.=20
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included =
the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His =
belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past cou=
ple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately =
respond.=20
"Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story," Wasden said.=20
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a "buy" or "strong=
 buy" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concer=
ns about the quality of Enron's reporting.=20
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last wee=
k started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with=
 energy trading partners.=20
"We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practic=
es. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid compan=
y," Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical r=
eaction. "This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings tha=
t I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."=20
Keeping Talent A Challenge=20

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration =
in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict t=
heir traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bon=
ds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk m=
anagers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does.=20
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all=
 companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial co=
mpanies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been sufferi=
ng damage to its talent for some time.=20
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key l=
ieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue.=
 Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was hi=
gh and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move =
on, if they haven't already.=20
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock opt=
ions to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options a=
re now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company cou=
ld struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core busi=
ness of trading energy in North America.=20
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling=
 left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it=
 was for "personal reasons." When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position =
last week, Lay said, "In my continued discussions with the financial communi=
ty, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require u=
s to replace Andy as CFO."=20
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoati=
ng Fastow was really the answer?=20
"I don't know anybody who said that," Wasden said. "What did the CFO do, wha=
t did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"=20
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said.=20
"Enron has been a cult, more than a company," he said. "Recruiting from with=
in does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron =
needs to pull some top talent from outside."=20
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and,=
 if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover =
over time.=20
"There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operatin=
g assets, like pipelines and power plants," he said.=20
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past=
 few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choi=
ce. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.=20

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from t=
rading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company=
's credit status, industry sources said on Monday.=20
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of E=
urope's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U=
=2ES. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
"I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board a=
s quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow," said the =
head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron l=
ast week.=20
"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit," he said. "The peopl=
e that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis.=
"=20
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters decline=
d to comment.=20
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebui=
ld investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows.=20
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com=
mission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation =
run by its former chief financial officer.=20
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Euro=

Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels w=
ith more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 bil=

Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power ma=
rkets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in =
the last couple of years.=20
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK e=
lectricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the bi=
ggest five traders in the market.=20
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potent=
ial counterparties are treading with care.=20
"We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or=
 by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader)," said a senior trader at one of=
 Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named.=20
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity=
 although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning.=20
"Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a=
 problem," said one French trader.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector agai=
n looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be c=
lass-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least fi=
ve shareholder suits.=20
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court=
 and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken La=
y, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andre=
w Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absen=
ce Oct. 25.=20
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as def=
endants members of Enron's board of directors.=20
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up=
, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a co=
nflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging=
 transactions with Enron.=20
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of under=
performing assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments.=20
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chie=
f financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances.=
 As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties t=
o billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those pa=
rtnerships.=20
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's s=
hare price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trad=
es with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from earl=
y termination of the deals, among other things.=20
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law=
 firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking=
 about the lawsuits.=20
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &=
 Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release po=
ints out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 bil=
lion from class action lawsuits.=20
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of =
the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow "purportedly involved hedg=
ing transactions in the broadband market," according to Abrams and Franks v.=
 Enron et al.=20
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for=
 months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the =
only ones trading bandwidth.=20
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counter=
parties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enr=
on.=20
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done wit=
h the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow.=20
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco =
Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street =
Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper wa=
s a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enro=
n earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow.=20
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with a=
ny of those investment partnerships?=20
"I think if is too early to tell," Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Ban=
dwidth Beat. "As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles=
 from Enron."=20
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask =
Enron officials those questions, Bilek said.=20
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, sai=
d Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. "At this point, you can o=
nly talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in th=
e billions."=20
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for th=
e stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock.=20
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last yea=
r. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room=
 for losses.=20
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases=
 is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually =
a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said.=20
"Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine," he said. "Th=
is is a big case, by any means."=20
