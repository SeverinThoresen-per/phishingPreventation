Michelle,
I've just met with Cecil and Christin. We have divided the code into 3 parts=
,=20
and Cecil's
looking at the first part. Cecil, Helen and I will meet again tomorrow=20
morning to go through
the logic of the other two parts. Since Cecil is devoted completely to this=20
project, once he
starts coding, it should not take too long.=20

Best,
Alex
