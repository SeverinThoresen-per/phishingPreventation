Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we u=
pdate it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mi=
ll revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the Octobe=
r monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.=20
