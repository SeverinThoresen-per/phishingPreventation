Subject:	Outstanding Invoices

Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly =
$8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Altho=
ugh a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS =
employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our=
 vendors. =20
=20
If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pager=
s, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, aft=
er you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take th=
e appropriate action to process the invoice (s) . =20
=20
Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your=
 iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days =
of e-mail notification. =20
=20
I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices. =20
=20
I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will contin=
ue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see signi=
ficant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carol=
yn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the =
ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.

Thank you for your commitment to improving our accounts payable process and =
for paying our vendors on time. =20
