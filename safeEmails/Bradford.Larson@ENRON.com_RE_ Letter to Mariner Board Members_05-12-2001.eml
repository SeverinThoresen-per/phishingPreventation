Rick/Dave

Agree with Dave as below

Seems the mindset should be to sell everything. Scott plans to turn Mariner =
into a GOM Shelf company after he sells off the deepwater.

I don't see why the "Basin" team (who were just put on contract to pursue a =
Shelf strategy) need an extension. Presumably Mariner isn't going to have a =
Shelf play going forward (and don't have a Shelf position to preserve).

Rick,

My views are as follows:

- The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of s=
ignificant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company sho=
uld also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right t=
o continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research in=
to our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be con=
ducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).

- The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than th=
e Enron package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it m=
ay create an issue with the creditors committee for the Enron bankruptcy.

- The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my op=
inion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in =
light of the Enron situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

I don't see why the "Basin" team (who were just put on contract to pursue a =
Shelf strategy) need an extension. Presumably Mariner isn't going to have a =
Shef play going forward (and don't have a Shelf position to preserve).
