These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, =
I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither da=
te works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school h=
oliday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program ther=
e ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas,=
 so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I h=
ave a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am try=
ing to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tues=
day night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best beca=
use we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally=20

Thank you!

Below are two dates for October which are available for presentation.
Please tell me which one would work best for you all and whether you would
like to continue with a presentation or company night.
Oct 8th	6-7pm

Thank you and see you soon!
