Hi Kevin,

I have looked into your VaR question and, I don't think that your Var incera=
se is related to your Gulf Area Basis positions. =20

Between the 13th and the 16th of July you bought about (484) fixed price con=
tracts.   You went approx 4bcf shorter NYMEX, which increased your Var from =
about $500,000 to about $1,500,000 ($1 mm increase from one day to the next)=
=2E  Between the above mentioned days the NYMEX prompt price fell approx 17 =
cents.  Yesterday you again seemed to have added about (3) bcf of NYMEX shor=
ts on a down move of 14 cents in the prompt. MERC Prompot Vols are about 60%=
=2E....

So that's my take.......
I will look further into the problem if you still want me to.

Hope that helps

Thanks

Bharat

Bharat,

I feel that my var has been overstated recently due to my recent purchasing
of gulf area basis.  As I've bought, my var has continued to increase dramat=
ically.
I'm not sure of the reason, but typically gulf area basis rarely moves.  A $=
0.005
move is a rather dramatic move for example.  I spoke to Frank and he recomme=
nded
that I contact you so that you can do some investigation.  Below I've listed=
 some of
the points I'm concerned with.  Please let me know your findings as soon as =
you can or
stop down (3233C) if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.
