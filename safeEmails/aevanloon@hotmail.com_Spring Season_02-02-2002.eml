^Dear Green Roomers,

Registration for the spring season, which starts in April, is just around th=
e corner, and we need to submit money to GPSD.  The cost of the ten-game is =
$50 per player.  Some of you have already paid $25 or so to Jon for the wint=
er season, which unfortunately did not come to pass.  If I'm not mistaken, t=
he following people have already paid: Jon Gail, Jon Bloomfield, Bill Willia=
ms, Jay Flint, Jake Fox, Rick Rezinas, Scott Gates, Scott H (the keeper) , T=
ristan Brunin, Frank Ma, and Declan.  These people need to pay and additiona=
l $25.  $50 for everyone else.

Please give me an email in the next week or two if you plan on playing, and =
send checks or money to the address below.

Additionally, you are encouraged to recruit solid skill players for the team=
=2E  Especially at the beginning of the season, more players is better, and =
fresh blood is always a way to build the team.

See you all soon,
Adam Van Loon
