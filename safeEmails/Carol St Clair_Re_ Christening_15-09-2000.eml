I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I=20
can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot=

of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with=20
Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club=20
provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great=
=20
outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time. =20
Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively. =20
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles,=20
he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped=20
breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better=20
particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm=20
starting to get more sleep which is nice.

Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually her=

and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about=20
coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's=20
tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll=

get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope=20
you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having=20
you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you=
