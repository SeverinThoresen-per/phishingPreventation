Thanks for the updates.  When we had the problem with the server resynchroni=
zation, did someone from the Infrastructure team alert you ahead of time tha=
t they were going to do this during normal business hours, or did you have t=
o be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand.  Let=
 me know. Thanks. --Sally=20

Subject: Unify Operational Status


Here is a summary of Unify operations for today.  My plan was to provide the=
se reports to this audience through the end of this week, and then pick up a=
gain during next bid week.  I'll be glad to continue this type of reporting =
moving forward, please let me know if you are interested.  Alternatively, I =
could move to a weekly reporting of issues, and/or change the audience of th=
is report.  Your feedback on the matter is appreciated.

Summary of 9/28:
Heavy activity in the Gas system, especially in the afternoon.  System perfo=
rmance dropped during the afternoon, but no downtime was experienced.=20
At just after 3:00 pm, a network server experienced problems and as a result=
 one of our EDI servers was unable to accept new files.  No EDI files could =
be sent to our hub as a result.  As it turns out, the Infrastructure team wa=
s in the process of performing a critical re-synchronization on that server,=
 and the server was unable to write new data to disk for over an hour (durin=
g re-synchronization this window is typically just a few minutes).  Infrastr=
ucture typically conducts resynchronizations after-hours, but resynchronizat=
ion had failed on this box on several prior attempts, so the issue had becom=
e critical.  At 4:26 pm, the re-synchronization completed and all EDI files =
in the queue were processed normally, and our 5:00 pm intraday nom deadline =
was met. =20
Action Items:
The network servers referenced are to be decommissioned on October 5th, and =
will be replaced with newer more reliable servers.  This is part of a planne=
d project within the Infrastructure team.=20
I have discussed the issue with the Infrastructure team and communicated our=
 various intra-day processing deadlines.  They have committed to notifying t=
he Unify team in the event future emergency-type maintenance is required dur=
ing business hours.=20
On the Power side, we have caught up on all of our processing that was delay=
ed as a result of yesterday's outage. =20
