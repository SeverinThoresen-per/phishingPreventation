I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us tha=
t=20
the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase=20
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August=20
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully=20
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for you=
r=20
photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on th=
e=20
slowest possible method of getting to us.

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of=20
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that. =20

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How=20
are you doing?
