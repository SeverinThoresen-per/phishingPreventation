Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as=20
you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we=
=20
have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at=20
the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still=
=20
leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book=
=20
it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as=20
well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?
