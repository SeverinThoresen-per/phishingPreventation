=20
Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequ=
ently, his last day with us will be today.
=20
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start wo=
rking for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two famili=
ar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
=20
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had as=
ked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finali=
zed on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process =
took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was u=
nable to communicate Robert's decision until now. =20
=20
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the l=
oss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.
