THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
=20
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I=20
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all da=
y=20
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of=20
50 years."

The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50=20
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So Go=
d=20
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are=20
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that=
=20
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."

The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give=20
you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys=20
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey=20
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."

The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks? =20
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agree=
d.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep,=20
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do i=
s=20
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life=20
span."

The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing? =
=20
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way,=20
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and=
=20
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will=
=20
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agree=
d.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing=20
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to suppor=
t=20
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making=
=20
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home,=
=20
sit by the front door and bark at people!=20
