Computer Megamerger: Will Bigger Be Better? Houston Frets Over Symbol of Div=

For nearly 20 years, the city of Houston has looked to Compaq Computer Corp.=
 as a symbol of the city's efforts to diversify beyond its boom-and-bust ene=
rgy economy. But with Hewlett-Packard Co.'s proposed acquisition of Compaq, =
the nation's fourth-largest city once again is looking very much like an oil=
 town.=20
Indeed, Houston remains heavily tied to its bedrock industry: Of the city's =
economic base, 49% is related to energy, though that is down from 82% in 198=
2.
But Compaq, one of city's largest employers and best-known consumer name, he=
lped to soften the image. Jim Kollaer, chief executive of the Greater Housto=
n Partnership, the city's business advocacy group, said Compaq played the le=
ading role in its efforts. "We've used it as a major flag for recruiting," h=
e said. "Not having that banner to carry will be a loss."=20
The real impact to Houston of the acquisition is still unknown, although the=
re is widespread expectation of job losses at Compaq, which has 11,000 worke=
rs in Houston. But immediately, the prospect of losing the headquarters of i=
ts largest link to the high-tech New Economy is a psychological blow for the=
 Bayou City.=20
When skeptics looked down on Houston as a town that oil built, "we had a rea=
dy response to that," says Steve Currall, director of the Rice Alliance for =
Technology and Entrepreneurship at Rice University in Houston: "Compaq was t=
he original major magnet of human capital in the [information technology] se=
ctor" to the city.=20
Though Compaq wasn't created until 1982, its ties to Houston are deep. The i=
dea for the computer company was launched over dessert at the House of Pies =
Restaurant & Bakeries on one of the city's main thoroughfares. Plans for the=
 company are said to have been drawn up on a paper place mat. Once grown, Co=
mpaq bought the naming rights to the home of the National Basketball Associa=
tion Houston Rockets, and the company picked up sponsorship of the Houston M=
arathon. Compaq had also developed training programs with local community co=
lleges to train tech workers for manufacturing.=20
But while Compaq's name is on the basketball arena, the downtown skyline is =
dominated by towers that have the corporate logos of Exxon Mobil Corp., Texa=
co Inc. and El Paso Corp. And cranes are now building new skyscrapers for En=
ron Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. and Calpine Corp. While the energy sector sti=
ll dominates the regional economy, it is itself tremendously diversified, in=
cluding strong suits in oil and natural-gas production, petrochemicals, refi=
neries and an emerging cluster of companies involved in electrical productio=
n and distribution.=20
The city also boasts a massive port facility, a campus among the world's lar=
gest medical complexes and, of course, the National Aeronautics and Space Ad=
ministration. But Houston has mostly watched technology companies bypass it =
and head to other cities, including its intrastate rivals Dallas and Austin.=
 The boom "never took very good roots in Houston," says Bill Gilmer, a senio=
r economist at the Houston branch of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. "Once =
you get past Compaq and BMC Software and a few others, you are sort of throu=
gh."=20
Still, the city remains committed to diversifying its economy in order to av=
oid a rerun of the crushing energy downturn of the mid-1980s, when one in ev=
ery eight jobs was lost, about 225,000 in all, says Mr. Gilmer. As part of t=
hat effort, Mayor Lee P. Brown, the onetime drug czar under former President=
 Clinton, issued a statement yesterday promoting the city's attractiveness t=
o "the best and brightest workers."

HOUSTON -- Shell Energy Services, an affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, t=
he second-largest publicly traded oil company, said Tuesday that it will sto=
p selling retail power in Ohio and Texas because of a slowdown in U.S. dereg=
ulation.=20
Shell Energy will focus instead on selling natural gas in Georgia and Ohio, =
the company said.
"Volatile energy prices and an uncertain economic environment over the past =
few months have caused legislators, regulators, generators and marketers to =
reconsider their deregulation situations and strategies," Alan Raymond, pres=
ident and chief executive of Shell Energy, said in a statement.=20
The company said the slower pace of deregulation made it unlikely that it wo=
uld make a profit "in a reasonable amount of time" by selling retail power n=
ationwide.=20
Power prices in California, one of the first states to open its market, rose=
 exponentially last summer, and the state experienced a series of outages. P=
oliticians have accused the state's power sellers of profiteering in the com=
petitive market. The power sellers say there are flaws in the California mar=
ket model and the state has a supply shortage.=20
Shell Energy said it will find another marketer for its 30,000 Ohio customer=
s and will withdraw from Texas' retail choice program, scheduled to start Ja=
n. 1. Customers who selected Shell for the pilot program ahead of statewide =
deregulation will be returned automatically to their traditional utility.=20
Competitor NewPower Holdings Inc. said its New Power unit's base of resident=
ial and small-business customers continues to grow, and it remains committed=
 to retail energy competition. The company has customers in 10 states.=20
NewPower, a venture formed by Enron Corp. to compete with traditional gas an=
d electric utilities, said in a statement that natural gas presents "an attr=
active marketing opportunity," but it believes that "electricity deregulatio=
n is progressing strongly and provides a sustainable market that will only c=
ontinue to grow."=20
Shares of Shell fell 44 cents to $56.19 in the U.S. Shell is based in The Ha=
gue. Shell Energy is based in Houston.=20
Shares of Purchase, N.Y.-based New Power rose 15 cents to $14.15 on the New =

With another downturn looming, activity has dried up, saysMary Watkins.=20
Investor appetite for project finance bonds in Asiahas dwindled this year in=
 the face of credit ratingdowngrades, defaults and an uncertain economic and=
 legal environment.
According to Moody's Investors Service, there is expected to be only one cro=
ss-border project bond issue this year in Asia outside Australia and New Zea=
land.=20
Five years ago, governments across Asia thought the answer to their infrastr=
ucture funding problems was to turn to the private sector, with power statio=
ns, water plants, roads and railways being financed using funds from foreign=
 sponsors backed by international bank loans and bonds.=20
However, with another economic downturn looming, activity in the project bon=
d and bank market, which was at its height in the mid-1990s, has dried up.=20
Figures from Dealogic Capital Data ProjectWare, which tracks project finance=
 transactions, show that only two project bonds, worth about $600m, have clo=
sed this year. Both were in Australia.=20
This compares with 15 project bond issues in the region last year, worth abo=
ut $4.1bn.=20
Moody's says international investors now perceive a more palatable risk-rewa=
rd ratio outside emerging market economies.=20
Consequently, demand for infrastructure financing, which on a global scale o=
ver the next 10 years is estimated to require $1,000bn to $2,000bn of invest=
ment, far outstrips supply.=20
Batul Sharif of Project-Ware said that this year borrowers have turned to th=
e loans market, which has the possibility of political risk cover or a ratin=
g from one of the agencies.=20
"The loans market has been the better option to service the intricacies of a=
 project finance deal in a region with high political risk," Ms Sharif says.=
=20
International investors, meanwhile, have shunned project bonds in favour of =
US or high-quality Asian bonds.=20
Sean Chang, fund manager at Invesco in Hong Kong, says that companies fundin=
g or refinancing projects in the region are looking at the loan market as a =
cheaper funding option than the bond market.=20
"We are expecting a number of big issues in September and October when inves=
tors come back to the market. Investors will be looking at some selective co=
rporate bond issues," Mr Chang says.=20
Downgradings of project bond paper in Asia have soured project finance deals=
 for investors and banks.=20
Meanwhile, foreign companies, which had their fingers burnt a few years ago =
when state companies tried to renegotiate off-take agreements, are now incre=
asingly wary of throwing their resources behind billion-dollar projects in A=
sia as they did a few years ago.=20
In particular, currency volatility in the region and political tariff disput=
es of the type seen in Pakistan's Hub power project, or more recently in the=
 case of the Dabhol project in India, have served as reminders of the risks =
involved.=20
The Indian government is locked in a dispute with Enron, the US energy group=
, over payment for the $2.9bn Dabhol plant.=20
"The problem in Asia is the level of political and legal uncertainty," accor=
ding to Brian Cahill at Moody's in Australia.=20
"There is a level of scepticism. Some corporates are looking at the structur=
es in place and (concluding that) while they may be in place now, they may n=
ot be there in 10 years' time."=20
Despite the decline in support for cross-border project bonds, the funding s=
olution could come from local bank and capital markets with countries such a=
s Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea beginning to open up.=20
Given that sponsors in previous deals were caught out by the mismatch of loc=
al currency revenue and dollar-funded loans, local currency deals are provid=
ing part of the answer.=20
Citibank, which has a local bank network, says it is turning its attention t=
o managing local currency project bond deals.=20
It says that by using domestic rating agencies and working with local instit=
utions, it expects to see a rise in local currency bond issues of the type b=
eing used for Malakoff, the Malaysian power company.=20

FIs agree to reduce interest rate on DPC loans

AS part of the package for bringing down the project cost of the controversi=
al Dabhol power project, the domestic financial institutions led by Industri=
al Development Bank of India have in principle agreed to reduce 2 per cent i=
nterest rates on their loans to the project.=20
The squeeze in project cost is aimed at bringing down the tariff of the powe=
r generated by the project to a reasonable level.
We have in principally agreed to make a sacrifice take a cut on interest by =
two per cent on the loan amount. We are also exploring other the possibiliti=
es for bringing down the overall project cost, a senior IDBI executive told =
ET.=20
It could not be, however, ascertained whether the foreign lenders would also=
 take a similar cut on interest rates on their loan amounts to the Enron-pro=
moted 2144 MW project.=20
The move on the cost cut comes even as the FIs are busy negotiating with var=
ious prospective buyers of how the Enron stake could be bought by another co=
mpany.=20
This is the first ever move since the government set up a high level committ=
ee of FI representatives who have been working closely with the finance and =
power ministry.=20
It has been proposed that the domestic lenders who have a total exposure of =
about $ 1.2 billion will slash their interest rates for the debt given for t=
he Enron project. The total debt exposure of the project stands at $ 1.9 bil=
lion.=20
This will be the second cut in interest rates in this fiscal. The last time,=
 the project developers themselves had approached the state government and s=
tate electricity board authorities and had suggested this as one of the poss=
ible ways to cut tariffs. However, the deduction then was far more steep wit=
h the FIs slashing rates from 21 per cent to 16.5 per cent.=20
If the proposal goes through, the interest rates for the loans will come dow=
n to 14.5 per cent which is just about the rate at which the FIsthemselves s=
ource their funds. Sources in FI circles said that a cut in interest rate at=
 this stage is one of the ways being explored to make the project feasible.=20
The whole idea behind the cost rationalisation exercise is to find a new dev=
eloper for the project. With Enron having made up its mind to pull out of th=
e project, the Centre along with the Fis are now trying to find ways to firs=
tly complete the project and secondly find a new developer for Enrons stake.

Loss of local PC giant a blow to city's image=20
By DAVID IVANOVICH=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s planned purchase of Compaq Computer Corp. means more t=
o Houston than the loss of a headquarters.=20
It's a blow to the much-cultivated image of Houston as something more than a=
n oil and gas town.=20
Since the Oil Bust days of the mid-1980s, city boosters have touted the dive=
rsification of Houston's economy. Compaq has given them a ready-made success=
 story.=20
With its legendary start at a brainstorming session at a House of Pies, its =
meteoric rise in the personal computer world, and its strong name-brand reco=
gnition, Compaq was Houston's answer to the new economy meccas of Austin, Se=
attle and Silicon Valley.=20
"Compaq was a recognizable name on the world market, and it was one we were =
able to utilize," said Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partner=
ship. "We'll just have to look at our marketing in a little different way."=20
The diversification strategy is evident in a 12-page glossy advertising inse=
rt the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau is running in the New =
York Times this month in an effort to promote the city.=20
"Houston's technology industry presence is transforming the `Bayou City' int=
o `Silicon Bayou,' " the ad declares. "The technology sector is key to the d=
iversified economic base that has fueled the city's growth through the past =
decade."=20
Compaq and BMC Software are both mentioned in the ad.=20
After the Compaq acquisition, city leaders still intend to trumpet what is e=
xpected to be a sizable Hewlett-Packard presence in the Houston area, noted =
Jordy Tollett, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau.=20
But it won't be the same.=20
"It's not like saying the company was founded here," Tollett said.=20
Of the 21 Houston-based companies that made the Fortune 500 list last April,=
 Compaq ranked No. 2, behind energy giant Enron Corp.=20
Houston has lost its share of venerable business names over the years, inclu=
ding Tenneco, Panhandle Eastern, Texas Commerce Bank, Transco, Coastal Corp.=
 and, recently, Mitchell Energy & Development Corp.=20
White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco -- which has a large presence in Houston -- =
is soon expected to be swallowed by Chevron Corp.=20
The people who market Houston say this is not just a local problem.=20
"We're dealing with the reality of operating in a global market," Kollaer sa=
id. "This is not an issue that is unique to Houston."=20
The economic effects of the loss of a corporate headquarters is typically no=
t as great as, say, the closing of a manufacturing plant, noted Ron Starner,=
 director of publications for Conway Data, which publishes Site Selection ma=
gazine.=20
"Most of the blow is psychological," Starner said. "It's perceived prestige.=
"=20
Higher-wage manufacturing jobs typically help create several jobs in the ser=
vice sector, Starner said. "You don't see the same multiplier effect with co=
rporate headquarters jobs."=20
But Houstonians may well notice Compaq's absence.=20
For the second year in a row, Compaq is the lead sponsor for the Houston Mar=
athon. Company officials have assured marathon organizers that they will aga=
in back the event in January.=20
But the company's role in future marathons is uncertain.=20
The company also retains the naming rights for the Compaq Center, for now th=
e home of the Houston Rockets. Those naming rights expire in 2003, about the=
 time the new downtown arena is expected to open.=20
Compaq officials would not say Tuesday whether the Compaq Center's name migh=
t change as a result of the deal.=20
It also has been a large supporter of arts organizations around town, includ=
ing the Alley Theatre and the Houston Symphony Orchestra.=20
"Compaq's just always been there, providing software and actual computers to=
 help the nonprofit arts organizations," said Laura Bodenheimer, development=
 director for the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts. "We are all hoping t=

INDIA: India to revive reform, boost demand for growth.
By Himangshu Watts

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - India will step up investment expenditure, giv=
e another push to its privatisation programme and reform labour laws to revi=
ve its slowing economy, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said on Tuesday.=20
"We want to give a stimulus to the economy," Sinha told reporters after Prim=
e Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's late-evening meeting with heads of key eco=
nomic ministries.
Sinha said he hoped the measures would boost demand and speed up economic gr=
owth which fell to 5.2 percent in 2000/01 from 6.4 percent a year earlier.=20
Analysts say the government needs to take decisive measures to revive the ec=
onomy as outlook for this year also appears gloomy with exports, industrial =
production and tax revenues down.=20
Vajpayee told the ministers that there were "major areas of concern" such as=
 the industrial slowdown, although some indicators such as inflation, food s=
tocks and the current account deficit were strong, Sinha said.=20
IMPLEMENTATION=20
Sinha said the government was determined to show results.=20
"The prime minister has taken the first step towards the observance of the y=
ear of implementation," he said referring to Vajpayee's declaration in his I=
ndependence Day speech last month.=20
Promised key economic reforms such as the revamping of restrictive labour la=
ws and privatisation have become stalled under Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata P=
arty led-coalition government.=20
The government has also been rocked by a string of scandals involving the de=
fence industry, domestic stock markets and a state-run mutual fund.=20
The drift encouraged international agencies to downgrade India's ratings and=
 outlook citing a slowdown in economic reform, unchecked budget deficits and=
 mounting debt.=20
Sinha said the prime minister had asked to cabinet secretary, India's senior=
most civil servant, to suggest ways to cut red tape and coordinate with vari=
ous ministries to implement projects that would generate demand in the econo=
my.=20
He said the government would encourage timely completion of large projects. =
The Press Trust of India reported that the power ministry had listed 14 proj=
ects involving an expenditure of 12 billion rupees ($255 million) which woul=
d be started this year.=20
India's Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment, which approves privatisation of =
state-run firms, would meet shortly to discuss "new areas of disinvestment" =
Sinha said.=20
He said a new cabinet panel on strategy would be set up. "There has been a f=
eeling that we have not been discussing economic strategy."=20
LABOUR LAWS=20
The government would also set up a group of ministers to study changes in la=
bour laws and prepare a new legislation.=20
"The endeavour of the government is to...introduce it in the next session of=
 parliament," Sinha said.=20
He said Vajpayee would call another meeting soon to discuss down-sizing of s=
everal ministries.=20
Vajpayee also discussed measures to boost foreign investment, but did not di=
scuss the woes of U.S. energy firm, Enron Corp , which wants to sell its equ=
ity in its troubled Dabhol plant, which is India's biggest direct foreign in=
vestment.=20
The meeting was attended by ministers and top officials from the power, petr=
oleum, finance, disinvestment and law ministries, among others.=20
It follows a weekend move by Vajpayee to expand his coalition cabinet and sh=
uffle several portfolios after what aides said was a performance review.

Energy-Policy Debate Looms Large As Congress Returns
By Bryan Lee
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

09/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Congress returns this week after a monthlong recess=
, and energy legislation is a top priority at committees in both the House a=
nd Senate.=20
A House Energy and Commerce Committee will hear testimony on nuclear power l=
iability issues Thursday, and the Senate Energy Committee resumes its "marku=
p" of a comprehensive energy-policy bill next week.
The House passed a considerable piece of the Bush administration's energy-po=
licy package in a bill this summer, which addressed key controversies such a=
s automobile fuel economy and drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic Natural Wi=
ldlife Refuge, known as ANWR.=20
Nuclear power and electricity restructuring issues are next on the agenda in=
 the House Energy and Commerce Committee.=20
The Senate will take up those controversies in one fell swoop, with ANWR pro=
mising to be the lightning rod for public attention and debate.=20
The campaign to convince the Senate against following the House in voting to=
 open ANWR to drilling began in earnest during the weekend, as environmental=
ists released a study disputing arguments that Arctic drilling will produce =
some 750,000 jobs.=20
The jobs argument helped drum up organized labor support for ANWR, with the =
AFL-CIO coming out in favor of drilling there on the eve of the House vote, =
joining with other unions such as the Teamsters.=20
The union support was touted as tipping the scales in the House in favor of =
ANWR drilling, and the argument was expected to be persuasive on the Senate =
side, as well.=20
The new assessment, sponsored by environmental groups, downplays the amount =
of oil to be derived from ANWR to conclude that fewer than 50,000 jobs will =
result.=20
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, will take the lead in arguing for Senate sup=
port of ANWR drilling in the face of filibuster threats from Sens. John Kerr=
y, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.=20
But whatever the outcome on ANWR, the Democrat-controlled Senate is certain =
to take a different tack on energy policy than the Bush administration.=20
Democrats have criticized the Bush plan as too heavily weighted in favor of =
domestic energy production that benefits the energy concerns that contribute=
d heavily to Bush's presidential campaign. They favor an approach that promo=
tes more conservation and development of renewable energy.=20
That is certainly the agenda for Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the=
 Senate Energy Committee. The committee's markup will continue next week, wi=
th energy conservation and efficiency at the top of the agenda.=20
Bingaman kicked off his committee's voting on energy-policy legislation last=
 month, promising to weave global climate-change objectives into the heart o=
f the Senate bill.=20
This will give Democrats a chance to highlight President Bush's opposition t=
o the Kyoto global warming treaty.=20
"One of the most important public policy issues we will face in the 21st cen=
tury is climate change," Bingaman said.=20
A key question going into this fall's debate is what actions Congress will t=
ake affecting the $220 billion U.S. electricity sector.=20
An effort last month by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, to bring tog=
ether various efforts in support of electricity restructuring legislation fa=
iled.=20
Bingaman, meanwhile, is calling for beefing up the regulatory muscle of the =
U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which will produce opposition fro=
m state regulators and various industry interests.=20
Lobbyists contacted Tuesday were skeptical Congress will reach agreement on =
electricity restructuring issues. FERC is now chaired by a Bush-appointee, P=
at Wood, the former head of the Texas utility commission, whose activist age=
nda at FERC is expected to take much of the wind out of the sails for power-=
sector reform in Congress.=20
When it comes to electricity, there are too many issues "where people are wi=
lling to lay down on the railroad tracks," said one former congressional aid=
e.=20
But congressional aides in both the House and Senate were confident that leg=
islation will emerge addressing the electricity sector.=20
"We have the president's support," said a spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Barton, R=
-Texas, who chairs the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee.=20
"Electricity is ripening very nicely," said a Bingaman spokesman, who sugges=
ted that the committee could turn its attention to the issue as soon as next=
 week, after the energy efficiency and conservation issues.=20
Competitive power providers are rolling out an advertising campaign Wednesda=
y in support of electricity restructuring legislation.=20
The Electric Power Supply Association and companies such as Enron Corp. (ENE=
), Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Reliant Energy (REI) have formed the Coalition for =
a Powerful Future to tout the economic and consumer benefits of electricity =
competition in "Power Points" television spots directed at members of Congre=
ss.=20
Whatever the outcome, both the House and Senate are on track to wrap up work=
 on energy-policy legislation this fall. It remains to be seen, however, whe=

omise energy bill in time to allow Congress to send a bill to the president =
before it adjourns for the year.=20
"It's all kind of uncertain," said a utility industry lobbyist.=20
"They'll do something on energy. The question is, how much do they actually =
do?" said another lobbyist. Despite all the wrangling in the House and Senat=
e this fall, much of the final energy-policy bill will be written behind clo=
sed doors in conference committee, the lobbyist predicted, citing the experi=

USA: US energy firms fear 'show trial' on power refunds.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Energy firms supplying electricity to the Pac=
ific Northwest denied on Tuesday they overcharged for power and called a fed=
eral agency hearing on the issue nothing more that a "show trial."=20
A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative law judge began severa=
l days of hearings this week on claims from Pacific Northwest purchasers tha=
t electricity suppliers owe refunds of some $1.5 billion from overcharges du=
ring the region's energy crisis earlier this year.
Refunds are being demanded by Puget Sound Energy and a host of Pacific North=
west cities, including Seattle and Tacoma.=20
FERC ordered a proceeding to determine if any refunds were due in the region=
, while establishing a separate case to review California's demand for $8.9 =
billion in refunds.=20
At Tuesday's hearing, electricity sellers - including Enron Corp. , Idacorp =
Inc. and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. unit Arizona Public Service Co. - joine=
d forces to defend their business practices.=20
"We overcharged no one," Dan Watkiss, an attorney for the power-selling firm=
s, told reporters during a break in the hearing.=20
Watkiss also complained to FERC judge Carmen Cintron that the selling firms =
were not given enough time to prepare for the hearing and the companies were=
 being rushed and denied their legal rights.=20
"This is really being reduced to a show trial," he said.=20
Cintron is scheduled to make her recommendations later this month to the FER=
C's four-member commission, which will then rule on the issue.=20
The Pacific Northwest purchasers suffered a setback last week when Cintron r=
ejected an attempt to force the selling firms to share specific data on thei=
r sales in the Western market to help determine if the companies owe refunds=
=2E=20
After the transaction data was submitted to Cintron, it was put under seal t=
o prevent other parties in the case or the public from examining it.
