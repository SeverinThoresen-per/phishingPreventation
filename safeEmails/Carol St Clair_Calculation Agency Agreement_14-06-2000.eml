Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent=20
would be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role=20
that Enron Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I a=
m=20
looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the=20
language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.
