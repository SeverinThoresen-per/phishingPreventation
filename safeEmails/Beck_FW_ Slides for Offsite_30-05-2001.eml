Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.  She is forma=
ting info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so yo=
u will get these as one presentation.  (Patti has already sent my slides so =
that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think t=
hat you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a=
 few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon=
 as we can.   Thanks, Tina. --Sally =20
