Lately there have been several questions concerning transmission purchases=20
from WACM or BCHA.  In order to access these OASIS Nodes we need to log on t=
o=20
Trade Agent in Terminal Server.  The Trade Agent login is on the same menu a=
s=20
Enpower and CAPS.  Open Trade Agent and log in using the EPMI Control Room=20
Certificate.   Trade Agent will then prompt you for the password.  Please se=
e=20
me for the password.  You will then be able to access the OASIS websites and=
=20
schedule power across the rockies(Canadian or US).  The websites can be foun=
d=20
in Cara's emails concerning the Westpower scheduling database.
Please take the time to become familiar with this system.
