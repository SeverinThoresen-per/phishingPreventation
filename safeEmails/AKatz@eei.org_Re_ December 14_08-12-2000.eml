identified for after the brown bag, which would be sometime after 2pm NY=20
time.  I have a call in to Michael Shenberg at Strook, Strook & Lavan to see=
=20
if it would be ok for Bill Fritz, (he's going to lunch) and I to stay at=20
their offices for the call.  Otherwise we'd go somewhere else.  I would set=20
up the call through our service.  ok?

On another note.  We will find out on the 11th what Southern wants to do for=
=20
the credit workshop in February (January is too early).  Because of turmoil=20
in the markets out west, Randy has now asked me to draft a program.  Any=20
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Also, I am now going ahead and=20
planning to do a California workshop for April 20th that would precede the=20
