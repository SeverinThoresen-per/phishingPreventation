POWER SHORTAGES: LV valley endures blackouts
Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues thi=
s=20
week=20

By JOHN G. EDWARDS=20
REVIEW-JOURNAL=20



The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas=20
Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co.=20

The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts tha=
t=20
left an estimated 10,000 customers without power. It had reported 70,000=20
customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost=20
electricity.=20

The blackouts started at 4:10 p.m. and ended at 4:55 p.m., the utility said.=
=20

Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors: unusually=20
high temperatures for this time of year, three generation unit outages, the=20
area's rapid growth, power shortages in California and, possibly, the=20
wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month.=20

"What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable," said Paul Heagan, vic=
e=20
president of Sierra Pacific Resources, the holding company for Nevada Power.=
=20
The Las Vegas temperature soared to a near-record 114 degrees.=20

As for the rest of the week, "power (supply) is going to be tight," Heagan=20
said. "The prospects this week are kind of tough to call."=20

The company logged record demand for power: 4,421 megawatts at 5:05 p.m.=20
Monday. The previous all-time high was 4,325 megawatts on Aug. 1. A megawatt=
=20
is roughly the amount of power needed to supply 750 houses.=20

By contrast, on July 2 last year, the utility hit 3,300 megawatts when the=20
temperature was 107 degrees, Heagan said.=20

The company targeted nonemergency areas for Monday's rolling blackouts, whic=
h=20
affected mostly residential customers.=20

Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after th=
e=20
emergency was over. Witnesses said power went out in one area of the=20
Northwest and one area of the east valley.=20

Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted betwee=
n=20
20 and 45 minutes.=20

Several traffic signals went out, including those at the intersections of=20
Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard, Tenaya Way and Lake Mead, and Boulder=
=20
Highway at U.S. Highway 95. Las Vegas Police Department officials reported=20
few traffic problems because of the blackouts.=20

For the most part, people reported few problems.=20

"We only had a few customers, and we couldn't do Western Union transactions=20
without a computer, but with the other customers we just winged it," said=20
Michelle Hitt, a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc., 7500 W.=
=20
Lake Mead Blvd. Hitt said power at his store was out about 45 minutes.=20

Across the street, an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at 7530 W.=20
Lake Mead Blvd. said customers could not check out when the store's power=20
turned off.=20

The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for=20
about 25 minutes shortly after 4 p.m., restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said.=20

"We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes=
,=20
but it was no big deal," he said.=20

Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of=20
the valley if it needs to cut power again this week.=20

The utility's policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power=
,=20
unlike California, where a minimum of 24 hours notice is required.=20

Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate=20
unoccupied houses during the emergency.=20

Tim Hay, state consumer advocate, said he thinks customers in affected areas=
=20
should be notified of possible outages. "They need to provide notice to=20
affected areas, at least in general areas" to help people prepare, Hay said.=
=20

Elsewhere in the valley, consumers and businesses continued operating=20
normally during the emergency.=20

Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the=20
shopping center.=20

"We know rolling blackouts can occur," he said. "We do have backup generator=
s=20
for emergency lighting during hours of darkness, but not for all the stores.=
"=20

Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said the=
y=20
were not affected by Monday's blackouts and have their own backup power=20
supplies.=20

Minta Albietz, vice president of maternal-child services at Sunrise:=20

"We have our own little power plant in the back. We can generate our own=20
power for 30 days, longer as long as we have fuel."=20

The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a=20
yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power, Heagan=
=20
said.=20

On Friday, Nevada Power customers were pulling down 4,300 megawatts, the=20
second- or third-highest peak in the company history, he said.=20

Meanwhile, one of Nevada Power's electrical generation units at the Reid=20
Gardner site 50 miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because=20
of a leaking boiler, he said. Also, Southern California Edison, which=20
operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities,=20
notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Power's units were down.=20

Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market=20
and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use=20
curtailment by major users.=20

The yellow alert continued through the weekend, a period when electric=20
consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people=20
are driving around.=20

The company made arrangements to buy another 250 megawatts of electricity=20
Monday when most businesses reopened. "That got eaten up by early afternoon,=
"=20
Heagan said.=20

The utility said casinos reduced about 50 megawatts by switching to backup=20
generators and starting conservation measures. But several Strip casino=20
operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on=20
their backup generation units.=20

"Nevada Power hasn't asked us to shed (power) load," said Debbie Munch, Park=
=20
Place Entertainment spokeswoman. "They asked us to cut our power usage a=20
couple of times last summer, and we did so. If they do ask us, we'll do what=
=20
we can to help the community."=20

Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to=20
cut their power use Monday.=20

"Our facilities guys said nobody's asked us for anything, and we haven't don=
e=20
anything," said Fred Lewis, Aladdin spokesman.=20

"At first glance, it appears the problem was handled very well," said Don=20
Soderberg, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, which regulates=20
Nevada Power.=20

"It's always hard to predict when we're going to have abnormal temperatures,=
=20
and power plants are going to go off-line," Soderberg said. The situation, h=
e=20
added, "underlines the need to build more power plants."=20

Monday's 114-degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date. The=20
heat follows the warmest May on record, said Joe Nemeth, a senior forecaster=
=20
with the National Weather Service. Temperatures are expected to stay warm bu=
t=20
tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases=
,=20
meteorologists reported.=20

Highs will stay in the triple-digit range, but drop to 110 degrees today, 10=
5=20
on Wednesday, 106 on Thursday and 103 on Friday. A less than 20 percent=20
chance for rain exists today, a chance that increases to 30 percent=20
Wednesday.=20

Forecasters expect a 40 to 50 percent chance of rain the rest of the week.
