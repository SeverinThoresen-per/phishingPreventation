Subject:	Summary of Commission Meeting



The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discussi=
ons on FERC's:

Administrative Issues
=B7	Strategic and 2002 Business Plan
Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yester=
day and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsibl=
e energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competitive=
 markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/custome=
rs through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In reachi=
ng these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impediment=
s to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing to adv=
ance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environmental con=
cerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as cost recov=
ery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff will be recom=
mending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan.
=B7	Infrastructure Adequacy
There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S. =
beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting wil=
l be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. The =
intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion.
=B7	California Infrastructure Update
Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capacit=
y was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The Califo=
rnia Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that mo=
re expansion in California is needed.=20

Constraint Study
FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be c=
ompleted by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York st=
ate and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or re=
commendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the resul=
ting costs to consumers.

RTO
FERC is imposing additional "incentives" to encourage the formation or joini=
ng in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered at =
a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in "RTO week" =
to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, tran=
smission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOPR is =
expected to be issued on market design and structure.

Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10
The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both na=
tural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmission=
 providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondiscri=
minatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the regulat=
ions and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all "energy af=
filiates."  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusion of =
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of energy aff=
iliates.   =20

The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of the=
 rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.     =20

Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merch=
ant function.
Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and woul=
d prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of the =
utility.=20

After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional langua=
ge added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may not =
be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and=
 the States.

Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the d=
efinition of "energy" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affili=
ates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broadenin=
g the definition to include all "energy affiliates" and no energy-type marke=
ting affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.

The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certain=
 information to all "energy affiliates".  The rules do not directly govern e=
nergy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the sepa=
ration of transmission employees, officers and directors from other business=
es.=20

Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or u=
nder emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

Gas Pipeline Operational Flow
FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 11.=20
