Hi Awesome Asem!

Proper Mapping Should go as Follows:

COB:  COB, COB N/S, COB S/N

PV: Palo Verde

MidC : Mid Columbia

California: NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26

NW MISC: Everything contained within the R-9 (MidColumbia) group except for =
Mid Columbia, and everything from R8 (WSCC-N) except the COB grouping.  Do y=
ou have those lists available?  If not, I will go type them up.

SW Misc:  Everything contained in the R7A (Rockies) region, and everything i=
n the R7 (WSCC-S) region except Palo Verde.

Let's go with the first draft being my extra CSV file, and we can upgrade to=
 include the data in the AGGSchedVol report later after Poston gives me his =
part.

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,
	Looking into the Physical and Bookout summary reports, upon recreating the =
functionality there are certain sections to the report which we aren't clear=
 on.. we are still needing to know which delivery points to map the followin=
g summary sections to:

	COB
	PV 		[Currently mapped to PALO VERDE]
	MIDC 		[Currently mapped to MID COLUMBIA]
	NWMISC
	SWMISC
	California	[Currently mapped to  NP-15, SP15 and ZP26]


	We've recreated the reporting functionality [excel based]  from within our =
new application.. and upon obtaining these mappings we can push this out to =
production for ya'll  asap.  If you'd like to have the summary report inform=
ation dumped into the 'Aggregate Schedule Volume Report' we can definitely d=
o that; but, would require us more time to get that functionality to you.=20

thanks

 The "California" region choice will be a combination of R10-R11and R12. (NP=
-15, SP15, and ZP26 respectively) =20

I do not know the desks that control anything on the list below, those all l=
ook just like emissions credit desks, which would not be handled by anyone h=
ere.

West Power is as Follows
California (as defined above) - EPMI ST-Cali and EPMI LT-Cali
WSCC-S and Rockies:  EPMI ST-SW and EPMI LT-SW
WSCC-N and Northwest: EPMI ST-NW and EPMI LT-NW.

Please note:  Any desk here can trade any point, so even though the STSW has=
 primary control over the daily trades, the body of trades will have probabl=
y all desks represented in it.

Corry,

Please give me the list of Region choices you want to see in Path Cut Detail=

Thanks,

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the mo=
st important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrappe=
d, and some aren't.  =20
Fixed Can we add a "master-detail" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list=
 of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper =
Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area=
 where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view=
=2E=20
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the "expanded view".  Also, deliver=
y points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on =
the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC)=
, the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be a=
n error-checking point?=20
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. J=
ust getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.  =20
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if t=
his was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserv=
ed from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point sele=
ction to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see=
 in Scheduling.=20
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the prop=
er date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the syst=
em. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incremental=
ly slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lin=
es where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_=
EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) for=
mat (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the =
required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cut=
s can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have t=
o be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.=
  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I =
would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of=
 an 'add-on' to the original cut.=20
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departm=
ents, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to=
 anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before=
 turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table tha=
t we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to art=
iculate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible.=20
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This nee=
ds to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection=
=2E  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, Cali=
fornia. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note wi=
thout hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a "Go to Cut" b=
utton was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will
