Andy,
I know EOL email is far down on the priority list but I wanted to forward th=
e responses to you.  Just about everyone we spoke with gave a positive respo=
nse.  It looks like our biggest hurdle is getting them to actually complete =
the information and not just ignore it.  If we ever went forward with this, =
I would suggest that we use pop up boxes first and then forward a list of th=
e remaining names that we need to the Master User to fill out.

-Dan


Here is a list of the companies and their responses about receiving email up=
dates from EOL:

Company					Response
Kansas City Power & Light			No problem asking for the information as long as=
 it is strictly for our use
Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co.		"
Cline Resources & Development Co.		"
Duke						Sounds great
Vitol						Sounds fine
Coastal						Perfect
Koch						Preferable
BP Canada					No problem with it
Chevron Canada					Would fill out the information
Engage Canada					Said that about 50% of the traders would take the time to =
give us the info.
TransCanada					They would fill it out
SaskEnergy Inc.				Not too excited about the deal but would consider it
Burlington Resources				Master User actually responded by sending a full lis=
t of user names, ids, emails and what they trade.
Unocal						Felt if we sent out a pop up survey about half of his traders wo=
uld fill in the info.
CMS						Thought most traders would ignore a survey as they feel Enron has t=
oo much information about them already.  However, if 						we sent the Maste=
r User a form that would assist in a higher level of customer service, he wo=
uld fill out the information.
BP Amoco					Felt most traders would ignore a survey unless they were forced=
 to fill it out
