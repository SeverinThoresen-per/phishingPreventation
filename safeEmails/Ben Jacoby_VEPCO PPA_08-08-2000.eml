Heather / Jeff:

Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as=20
some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development=
=20
timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:

1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can=20
choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our=20
expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our=20
highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a=20
modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config?=20

2. Do we need to define the Facility as "dual" fuel? It will not initially b=
e=20
dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.

3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base=
=20
Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that=20
VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In=20
other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to othe=
r=20
Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy=20
sales).

4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person=
=20
to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice=20
contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance fo=
r=20
energy sales)?

5. Section 3.4(c) Do the "additional costs" which this section requires Buye=
r=20
to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include=20
"lost-profit" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to=20
other Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that=20
this section make a specific reference, such as "including any and all of=20
Seller's lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and=20
capacity sales to other Persons".

6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the=
=20
PPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the exten=
t=20
we use an LLC?

 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM=20
accounting given the terms of this PPA? =20

Jeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in=20
order of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items=20
we'll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs.=20
municipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the=20
project development control matrix.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben
