LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A electrical fault in a transformer probably caus=
ed an explosion and fire on Wednesday at the Teesside power station in north=
ern England which killed three people, said British safety authorities on Fr=
iday.=20
"The evidence points to an electrical short (circuit) leading to an explosio=
n and fire in the transformer," a spokesman for the Health and Safety Execut=
ive (HSE) told Reuters.
The explosion on Wednesday afternoon killed three employees of the station o=
wner, U.S. utility Enron , and a fourth remains in hospital with burns.=20
The HSE is investigating the incident with the police who are looking to see=
 if there is evidence to support manslaughter proceedings against Enron, sai=
d the spokesman.=20
The spokesman said there was maintenance work going on at the plant when the=
 blast occurred but it was unclear if it involved the transformer.=20
The 1,875 megawatt gas-fired power station was closed immediately after the =
explosion and Enron said on Thursday no decision on future operations would =
be taken for several days.=20
"On-site activity may increase over the next few days as teams begin the pro=
cess of assessing the damage," said Enron in a statement.=20
Enron added the HSE may take weeks to complete their investigations.=20
The HSE said Enron had been prosecuted twice for incidents at the plant whic=
h was built in 1992 and is part of an industrial complex in the Grangetown d=
istrict of Middlesbrough.=20
The company was fined 10,000 pounds in 1998 after an explosion in 1996 in wh=
ich a worker suffered severe burns.=20
It was fined 17,000 pounds for an accident in 1992 when a construction worke=
r was hit by a vehicle.

LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - British electricity prices ended slightly weaker =
on Friday in quiet trade which concentrated on the winter 01 and summer 02 b=
aseload contracts.=20
"Winter baseload opened slightly weaker and fell to a low of 20.84 pounds pe=
r megawatt hour, although in very lacklustre trade," said one trader.
He added the contract firmer later to around 20.88 pounds, although this was=
 a drop of about 10 pence from Thursday's closing levels.=20
Summer 02 baseload also weakened slightly, ending the day down about 10 penc=
e at 17.77/17.85 pounds.=20
In the prompt market, day ahead baseload slipped to 16.50 pounds to reflect =
the usual drop in demand at the weekend.=20
Traders said the market was waiting for news of the restart of Enron's Teess=
ide power station which closed on Wednsday after an explosion in which three=
 workers died.=20
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) told Reuters the blast was probably ca=
used by an electrical short circuit in the power station's transformer.=20
The HSE investigation into the explosion is expected to take weeks to comple=
te, meanwhile Enron said no decision on future operations at the plant will =
take place for several days.

INDIA: INTERVIEW-Time running out to solve Indian row, Enron warns.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

08/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp warned on Friday tha=
t time was running out for reaching an amicable solution to a long-running, =
bitter dispute between its Indian unit and a local power utility.=20
The Houston-based company said it could terminate its contract with the Indi=
an utility after the federal government rejected its latest proposal to buy =
out Enron's stake in its subsidiary at cost price.
"The clock is continuing to tick down on the deadline," K. Wade Cline, chief=
 operating officer of Enron India Pvt Ltd, told Reuters in an interview. "Te=
rminating the contract is not inevitable, but it is a possibility if no solu=
tion is found."=20
Cline said Enron has not heard from the government directly, but India's jun=
ior power minister rejected the proposal in parliament on Thursday.=20
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a state-run provincial power utilit=
y and Enron's Dabhol Power Corporation are locked in an acrimonious row over=
 the terms under which they agreed to buy and sell power.=20
The cash-strapped Indian utility now claims it does not need all the power t=
hat Dabhol wants to supply. It says the power is too expensive anyway, while=
 Enron's subsidiary says the Board is reneging on its contractual obligation=
s.=20
In May, Dabhol stopped supplying power to the Board from its 2,184 MW gas-ba=
sed power plant on the west coast of India after the utility defaulted on pa=
yments.=20
Dabhol then served the utility a preliminary termination notice, but this st=
ill gives the two feuding sides until November to solve the issue through ne=
gotiation. After this, DPC is free to terminate the contract.=20
WASTED INVESTMENT=20
If Enron terminates the contract, then the $2.9 billion power project is in =
danger of going down the drain.=20
This now seems closer to reality after the Indian government rejected Enron'=
s suggestion that it buy Enron's 65 percent stake in Dabhol at cost price.=20
The U.S.-based diversified company General Electric Co and construction grou=
p Bechtel each hold 10 percent in Dabhol Power Company, while the provincial=
 utility owns the remaining 15 percent. The total equity investment is worth=
 $900 million-1.0 billion.=20
"We have given an option to the governemnt to solve the issue in a non-conte=
ntious way and without the need for a final termination notice," Cline said.=
=20
Enron said it is looking to recover only the cost from its Indian venture an=
d is willing to forego any profits.=20
"No profits, no return on our investment, just our cost and not a penny more=
," Cline said, but declined to divulge the exact value Enron expects for the=
 proposed stake sale.=20
"We have mentioned the figure in the letter to the government but we are not=
 talking about it," he said.=20
He said the dispute needs to be resolved quickly. "It is having a big negati=
ve impact on perceptions of India among investors," he said.=20
ROOT PROBLEM=20
At the heart of the controversy between Dabhol and the Indian power utility =
is the power tariff, which varies depending on how much power the utility dr=
aws down.=20
Cline said Enron is trying hard to solve the issue, with proposals like agre=
eing to reduce its tariff to 3.50 rupees per unit. At some levels of usage, =
the tariff can be as high as 7.0 rupees per unit.=20
He said there is a huge misconception about Dabhol's tariffs, which are on p=
ar with most new generation power plants including those of the state-owned =
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).=20
"NTPC's new generation plants are producing at more or less similar rates. T=
hey are not being asked to reduce their tariffs. why are we being asked to d=
o so?"=20
Enron's offered to lower its tariffs and sell the surplus power that the sta=
te utility felt it didn't need to buyers in other states. But the buyers, al=
l state-owned utilities, said the tariff was still not low enough and could =
pay nothing more than than 2.50 rupees per unit.=20
When asked if Enron would consider a further reduction, Kline said: "If ther=
e is a proposal, we will evaluate it. But my question is who will take the h=
it. We cannot decide on this issue alone. We will have to sit with lenders, =
shipowners, construction contractors to decide."=20
"We took a hit on our returns, the lenders took a hit on theirs, the ship ow=
ners and the suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) also took a hit throug=
h this proposal. We had no incentive to do this. We have done nothing wrong.=
" ($1=3D47.11 Indian rupees).
