t hub ? Is it connected to NY, either Zone G or Zone J ?

Brandon and Harry:

Brandon:  I assume the pricing is at the mids.  Also, since the spread betwe=
en the 1.50VOM and the 3.00VOM is so small, I'll just quote the 1.50.

Harry:  Please look at the entire email thread (to get a sense of all the me=
trics we're employing for this quote).  ConEd has already announced a 3x7FA =
peaker configuration for Lakewood, NJ.  The site is already owned by ConEd, =
part of an existing 230MW combined cycle plant they already own.  It's on th=
e same transmission line (running to the south) as the Oyster Creek nuclear =
facility, which has a license expiration in 2009.  The existing plant is a n=
on-merchant EWG, selling 215MW to JCP&L pusuant to a twenty-year PPA expirin=
g in 2014.  ConEd has put out an RFP to sell 200-250MW of the peaking capaci=
ty from this planned facility.  They planned to have the unit operational by=
 June 2002.  If we provide this synthetic toll, the plant construction would=
 be deferred.  Let me know if we can do 350 to 500MW and let's talk about ap=
propriate spreads above the mids.  Also, please be mindful of their desire f=
or 8 hour mins.

Thanks

Pricing as follows:
For the 3 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.77
$3.00 VOM - $1.69

For the 4 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.74
$3.00 VOM - $1.66

As always, these prices are indicative.  For a product of that size (350-500=
MW), I would probe the customer to find a break-even/cost of construction pr=
ice, and approach Harry to get the risk premium.
Let me know how it works out,
