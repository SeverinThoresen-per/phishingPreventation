Jeff and Mona - Above is a link for the New Democrat Network (NDN) West Coas=

Retreat.  We are Executive Council Member of the NDN.  You can attend for al=
l=20
or portion of the retreat.  There will local, state, and federal elected=20
officials attending.

Jeff - The NDN has been helpful by trying to moderate the tone of the energy=

debate in DC and they did not include price caps in their energy plan (thoug=
h=20
some of the West Coast members support them).  They will hold an energy pane=
l=20
and Speaker Hertzberg will attend

Mona- Note that the schedule is technology heavy and TechNet is a sponsor of=

the event.

Sorry for the late notice.  Let me  know if you are interested.

Thanks - Chris (202) 466-9158
