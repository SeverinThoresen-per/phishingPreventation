This is an example of the type of invoice that could possibly create issues =
for Newco, if Enron is an owner is some fashion.  To my knowledge, we are no=
t paying these unless there is an Enron physical position that we are contin=
uing pending a sale.  While Newco may or may not be responsible for Enron's =
debts, the fact that the other regional members will have to pick up these c=
osts could, at the least, make a new quick membership somewhat difficult (we=
 may ultimately be right, but they could raise a stink in the meantime).  I =
don't know if the bankruptcy attorneys/Newco bank attorneys have looked into=
 this.  Let me know how we can help.
