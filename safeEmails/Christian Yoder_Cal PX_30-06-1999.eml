Here is a final thought about this PX situation before I take off.  In the=20
normal give and take of haggling that has been going on since time out of=20
mind in trading transactions, there is an element of deception.  The seller=20
always bluffs that his product is much more valuable than it actually may be=
,=20
in fact, the less valuable the product, the more the bluffing.  The buyer=20
always treats the seller's product with disdain.  It is fundamentally=20
necessary for an efficient market to work for buyers and sellers to be able=20
to string each other along  with various  posturing gambits.  Price is the=20
result of two hagglers finally coming forward out of the smoke surrounding=20
their ritual dance  and shaking hands on a number.  By experimenting with th=
e=20
nuances of the PX software system  are traders not  merely doing what they=20
have been doing since Biblical times,   i.e.  interjecting the absolutely=20
essential ingredient of deceptive posturing  into the relatively new form of=

it should be seen as a temporary experiment and rejected in favor of the tim=
