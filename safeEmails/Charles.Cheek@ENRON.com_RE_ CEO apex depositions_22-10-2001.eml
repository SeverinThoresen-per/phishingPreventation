Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition=
 in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discovera=
ble information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the cour=
t of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more a=
nd more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion=
 in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavi=
t in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state=
 that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than sayi=
ng that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant fa=
cts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ?=20
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the c=
ourt to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this ca=
se to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If th=
e Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this=
 time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex d=
epositions.=20
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is int=
erested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they =
can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8=
470) in our Dallas office.=20
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday.=20
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.    =
