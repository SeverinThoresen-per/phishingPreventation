THIS NOTE IS FROM TED MURPHY (not bjorn hagelman)

My understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the=20
intent of diverting resources from the GRMS project to some other project.

While I am not privy to the urgency of this other project, I do know that we=
=20
have a very large, multi -phase project going in GRMS.
GRMS stands for the GLOBAL RISK MONITORING SYSTEM.  It is not intended to be=
=20
a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial=20
decision-making.  Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary=20
purpose of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems=
=20
and their inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.=
 =20

RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task=
=20
list to accomplish its objectives.  As a firm we are woefully behind our=20
press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.=
 =20
My most recent sojorn  in Europe is a classic example of the current systems=
=20
inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision=
=20
making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that=20
of the Market Risk Group in RAC. =20

The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to=20
do our jobs.  We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter=
=20
to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with=20
Jonathon and his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.  While progres=
s=20
is never as fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have onl=
y=20
to rely on RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been=
=20
hit.  The primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of=
=20
resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other=20
source - most recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to=
=20
deadlines. =20

Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note=
,=20
but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.=
 =20
Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustratio=
n=20
on the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting=20
itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.

I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphas=
e=20
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.  Please let u=
s=20
do our jobs.  I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that=20
they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our=20
consideration of their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own=20
project with their own resources.

Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.  As it relates to things=20
that will effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me=
=20
as I would you.

Ted
