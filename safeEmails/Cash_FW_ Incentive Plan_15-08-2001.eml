Diane, I've left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please fo=
llow up, as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call.  Ba=
sically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we =
want to dissolve it.  Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via emai=
l as to what it would entail?  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle, since you initially were involved, can we quietly dissolve this pl=
an since EIP is no more??  Please advise. Thanks.=20
