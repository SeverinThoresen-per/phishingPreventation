Paul,

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re ener=
gy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would=
 recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that me=
eting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mar=
k Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he h=
as had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions a=
nd will likely call to discuss.=20

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in ups=
tream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in=
 expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.
