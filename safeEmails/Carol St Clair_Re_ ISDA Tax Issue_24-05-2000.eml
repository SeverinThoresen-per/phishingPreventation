Thanks for your response.  I have asked Deutsche Bank for the name of their=20

Carol:

I'd rather not change our standard agreement.  Specifically, the current=20
definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" covers both present and future tax (as=20
evidenced in the definition "Tax") and thus, necessarily, should protect the=
=20
counterparty in the case of a "Change in Tax Law."  Moreover, Deutsche Bank'=
s=20
amendment to "Indemnifiable Tax" potentially subjects us to risk that I don'=
t=20
feel is in our best interest to assume because we don't have any control ove=
r=20
the counterparty's activities.  Bottom line - I would reject the amendment.

Please let me know if you would like me to speak to their tax counsel.

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of=20
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax". =20
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I=20
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed=
=20
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a=20
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated,=20
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such=20
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch o=
r=20
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is t=
o=20
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's=20
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basi=
s=20
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It=
=20
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?
