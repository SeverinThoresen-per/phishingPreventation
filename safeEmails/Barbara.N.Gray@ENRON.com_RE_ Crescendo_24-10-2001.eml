Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal=
 relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investme=
nt done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in =
Utah and Colorado..............the "Crescendo entity" is managed by non-Enro=
n personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears th=
at Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine th=
e relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and S=
ullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM....=
=2E.......Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Jo=
sey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.
best regards   bng

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate cont=
act for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is pr=
obably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact informati=
on on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the=
 helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy =
is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all. =
