I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computer=
s in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is t=
o destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materia=
ls is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said th=
at if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not=
 have  a duty to report it.

We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able=
 to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually wa=
s involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the lo=
cal FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Giv=
en the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take th=
at route.

In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed=
 and removed from our systems as soon as possible.

Michelle
