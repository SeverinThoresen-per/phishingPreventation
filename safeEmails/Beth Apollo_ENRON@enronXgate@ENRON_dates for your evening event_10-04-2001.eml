Hope this helps

I am out of town on the 20/21 of April  so not able to make it

Friday or saturday the 27th/28th of April are fine

Saturday the 5th is ok (not the prime choice as Frank's flight gets in from =
the offsite at 6pm that night unless he changes it or comes straight to your=
 house - which I am 			willing to make him do)

we are out of the weekend of the 11th and 12th

and ok any other time in May

Beth
