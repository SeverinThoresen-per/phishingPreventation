Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals=
=20
240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I=
=20
have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough ga=
s=20
at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can=20
achieve this. =20

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at=20
mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any=20
days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any=
=20
shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA=20

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to kee=

Why do you need it extended?  This deal may not be able to get extended. =20
Which meter are you having problems with?
