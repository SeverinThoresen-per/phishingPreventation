I think the proposed structure may work very well for credit risk management=
=20
since Enron would only be using one US entity and presumably the counterpart=
y=20
would only be using one US entity. I am assuming that MG London, Inc. (now=20
known as Enron Trade Services, Inc.) would be agent/arranger for ENA. I am=20
also copying Bill Bradford (Trade Credit) on this proposal to get his team's=
=20
input.

It will also be interesting to get the feedback from Janine and Tina in Tax=20
on this proposal.

Gentlemen,=20

I met with Craig Young (MG US) last week, who is keen to progress metals=20
business with large US corporates (e.g. Anheuser Busch), on the following=20
basis:

o Assume ENA and US Corporate are existing parties to ISDA/Credit Support=20
Documents (the "Master").

o ENA and US Corporate would agree to expand range of OTC products to includ=
e=20
OTC metal derivatives under the Master.  The principals to the metals trades=
=20
would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.  These trades would however be=20
"arranged" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as "arranger" in the US for ENA.

o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals price=
s=20
to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission=20
from MG London Inc.

o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group=20
ISDA Master.

Look forward to your views.

Thanks.
Justin
