Audrea,

I have checked with our legal and credit departments. Enron hereby grants PC=
S Nitrogen permission to discuss the swap positions between Enron and PCS wi=
th Bank of America.   These discussions are for the purpose of working towar=
ds a transaction whereby B of A would step in between Enron and PCS in regar=
ds to any natural gas swaps and options positions that you currently have in=
 place with Enron.=20

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.

Regards,

Craig Breslau
