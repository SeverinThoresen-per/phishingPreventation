SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Tembec Inc., the second-large=
st capacity pulp producer in North America, plans to shut down its mills for=
 the month of August due to weak market conditions, said a company executive=
=2E Earlier, Tembec had announced it would curtail pulp production by about =
100,000 tonnes in the third quarter.
"All of it (is market-related downtime), most is in August," said the execut=
ive, who indicated the firm would =D4shut down cold' most of its facilities =
systemwide for the month. "My customers are taking downtime and I in turn to=
ld them we will match their downtime. Our October 1 inventory will be the sa=
me as in '99 when the market was tight."
Last week, an industry source noted that Tembec would take a month of downti=
me at its 227,000 tonne/yr northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) mill in S=
kookumchuck, B.C. With the closure in August, that mill will lose about 20,1=
19 tonnes while Tembec's other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will t=
rim about 16,926 tonnes based on capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBS=
K downtime will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of its 3=
Q downtime.=20
Tembec's third-quarter curtailments equal the firm's combined downtime on th=
e year, with 55,000 tonnes trimmed from supplies in 2Q. But the executive sa=
id this quarter there were no plans to perform maintenance.=20
"We have no traction in prices because the inventories (industrywide) are to=
o high. Shutting down now is not going to cost us in sales. We have stock. G=
iven that paper business returns to normal I will be able to run my business=
 normal."
