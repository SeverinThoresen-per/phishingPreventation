Sure, we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people.  They would have=
 issues around payroll and benefits, but those can be handled.  Michelle

Michelle,

Have you had situations in the past where we've needed to set up a company/L=
LC to house employees separate from EGM/Enron Americas, etc.?

I'm working with limited information, but the Freight group has a potential =
deal where they will buy a trucking company and need a place to house the wo=
rkers outside of EGM.  Another idea we are considering is using an outsourci=
ng company, similar to Administaff, but this is expensive and it will be dif=
ficult to find somone to take on the liabilities associated with this type o=
f workforce.

Thanks,
Shanna
