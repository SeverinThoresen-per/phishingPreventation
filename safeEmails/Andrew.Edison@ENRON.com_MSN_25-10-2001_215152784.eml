The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN form=
ally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working wit=
h the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN'=
s registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possib=
le  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit =
to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if=
 any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delaye=
d.

I will keep you updated.

Andy
