If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunc=
h a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, y=
ou have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by =
going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your pri=
nter. Thanks.
