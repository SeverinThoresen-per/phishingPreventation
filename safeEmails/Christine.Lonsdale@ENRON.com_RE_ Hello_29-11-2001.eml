You will be popular, Jonathan W seems very excited about the new position he=
's in.   I presume he assumes we'll all be working for him - not necessarily=
 bad news though.

Things are very much getting back to normal here - we actually didn't work t=
his week-end!

Where did the Chris come from - did you drop the 'tine'?

Dear Louise
Sorry I haven't got back before - can't imagine why! How I things with you -=
 here people seem to be going thru the various stages of mourning; I think w=
e're between anger and resignation right now. As the only ex-Dynegy person h=
ere my popularity has shot up - things were put in perspective when someone =
asked me if there were any good-looking blokes in Dynegy!
Answers to your much earlier questions - Jonathan & Lesley were surprised an=
d amused when I congratulated them some while ago on their marriage - they c=
learly weren't & I don't think that's changed.
Jennifer got a decent package out of Powergen, went to TXU where she spent a=
 great time skiing in Geneva with the family and then got another good payof=
f. She then went on to EdeF to advise them how to manage/renegotiate their l=
ong-term contracts (sound familiar?) - I think she just wanted to consult bu=
t they offered her a full time job. Got the distinct impression she's regret=
ting accepting it as she has to commute, work in an open-plan office (where =
ordering curtains, beauty treatments etc is not very private business!) and =
deal with the French. Haven't seen her since the summer tho' and haven't see=
n Caroline for years. She's just waiting for the Hess sale to see whether sh=
e's wanted - timetable's slipped a bit and probably won't be completed until=
 March or later. I will have to get back in touch as I might need some old f=
riends.
Jonathan W. and Dave Redmond started at Dynegy Monday so inside info should =
be available.=20
Keep in touch and keep the faith
Best Wishes
Christine

Did Jonathan and Lesley ever get married?

Marcus spoke to Caroline last week and said she wasn't very happy.  It would=
 probably be great for Caroline to do something else. =20

I have no opportunity to get to London at all as I have no dealings with any=
one in London any more.  I do speak to Marcello and Matthew Scrimshaw regula=
rly and keep up on the gossip although there frankly doesn't seem to be much=
=2E

Whatever happened to Jennifer - I was thinking about her the other day as I =
saw Mike Gibbons is still a Director of PowerGen. =20

Are you coming over here at all - it would be great to see you over this sid=
e of the water.  David Hutchinson is coming over next month.

Louise

Hi Louise
Yes, thought I'd follow in your footsteps but a bit late in the day for me t=
o catch up! Dynegy was no longer the place to be.
Working for Mr Crilly which is interesting - Andy & co are a great bunch of =
guys on the trading desk. I'm staying off the phones (too old for all that) =
and am doing "strategy" - will get them sorted out here in the end!
Saw Lesley and Jonathan at their house warming a couple of weeks ago - they =
were looking good (even Jonathan) and the house was lovely. Lesley would lov=
e to see you if you're ever over (so would I). Things might not be too good =
for Caroline - Hess Marketing up for sale
