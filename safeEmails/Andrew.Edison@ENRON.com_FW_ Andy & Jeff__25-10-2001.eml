Andy & Jeff:

We have scheduled a conference call on Oct. 30 (Tuesday) at 3:00 p.m. with t=
he Judge to discuss setting the motion to transfer for hearing and our reque=
st that oral testimony be allowed.  TDC will oppose this request.  If the re=
quest is granted, they will ask to depose anyone who is called.  Frankly, if=
 they do not need further discovery to prepare a reply, I don't understand w=
hy they would need discovery to have a hearing.  Nonetheless, the judge will=
 make that call.

Andy, I don't believe you need to be on the call (although you are certainly=
 welcome), but since Nelson is our likely witness, please find out if any da=
ys in Nov. are particulary bad.  Be aware that a possible hearing day is Nov=
=2E 21, the day before Thanksgiving.  Let me know if you want to be on the c=
all with the Court.

Jeff, I will plan on patching you in unless you are not available or do not =
think you should be on the call.

Robert
