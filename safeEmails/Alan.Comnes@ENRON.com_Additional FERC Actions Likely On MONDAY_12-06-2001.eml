FERC has set a meeting for Monday18 June 10 am PDT wherein it has noticed it=
s California and WSCC-wide dockets.  The meeting has been timed in advance o=
f congressional hearings (by Senator Joseph Lieberman) that were set for lat=
er in the week.

Expect FERC to respond to intense political pressure to expand its current p=
rice mitigation measures, possibly to a WSCC-wide scope or to all hours, or =
both.

As far as I know Hebert is still President of the FERC, which would speak to=
 less intervention rather than more.

We will forward information as we learn it.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has s=
cheduled a special meeting June 18 to address pending matters involving elec=
tricity markets in California and neighboring Western states.=20


The commission's meeting notice provides no details, except to list for disc=
ussion four cases involving price mitigation in, and the structure of, volat=
ile power markets in California and 10 other Western states.


The meeting comes as members of Congress are placing enormous political pres=
sure on the commission to take more drastic action to contain runaway electr=
icity prices in the region.=20


Last week, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., joined 21 Western-sta=
te congressional lawmakers to request an opportunity to appear before the co=
mmission to argue their case for cost-based price controls in the region's e=
lectricity markets.=20


"At least twice, FERC has determined that the Western electricity market is =
'dysfunctional' and that prices are 'unjust and unreasonable' under the Fede=
ral Power Act. Despite these findings, and contrary to the law, the commissi=
on has failed to bring these rates to just and reasonable levels," the lawma=
kers said in a letter to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.=20
