Talked to Tim last night - basically, they were either letting people know b=

 had a position with the estate and leave it up to them as to whether or not=

 reporting relationship and/or what they would be doing, but felt that every=
one would have a role at least in the short-term.  I believe that Wednesday =
is the day that UBS will be in Portland to do benefits review and UBS overvi=
ew......
