Hi Sharon,
=20
Brad's manager is aware that we are exploring the possibility of a conflict.=
  Brad is currently in the Freight Markets group where he has developed pric=
ing models for this new business. Brad's current manager does not foresee a =
conflict and I believe Brad developed these models in between being an assoc=
iate and a full time hire.  Brad did not create the models as a part of his =
job responsibilities and although Brad says we are not currently in the busi=
ness of trading long distance minutes, it is not far-fetched to think that w=
e may at some point.
=20
If you have further questions, I would be happy to arrange a brief meeting w=
ith Brad and his manager - this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject=
=2E
=20
Thanks,
Shanna

Dear Shanna:=20

Thanks for your message.  Has Brad discussed his involvement with his manage=
r?  What is the nature of Brad's position here at Enron.  Does his managemen=
t foresee the possibility of a conflict with respect to his responsibilities=
 here at Enron?  Did Brad develop the model while an Enron employee?  Does h=
e create models as part of his job responsibilities at Enron?  Is Enron in t=
his market?  Does Enron anticipate entering into this market?

Please advise.=20

Thanks.=20

Sharon=20

Have you had an opportunity to review this issue?  Brad is anxious to contin=
ue the employment agreement process, but we need to determine whether his in=
volvement in this business poses any conflict first.

Thanks,=20

This is the write-up that Brad Romine prepared explaining his involvement wi=
th a communications company.=20

Per our conversation last week, we are now trying to determine if this busin=
ess involvement presents a conflict with Enron's Code of Conduct and if so, =
how to handle.  This situation arose when EGM offered Brad an employment agr=
eement.   Brad reviewed the non-competition language and wondered how his in=
volvement in this business would be handled.

Please advise as to next steps so that we may proceed with the employment ag=
reement process.=20

Thanks,=20

Shanna,=20
        Per your request here is a brief description of my relationship with=
 Bluewater Communications.=20

        Bluewater is a provider of prepaid calling cards. They purchase minu=
tes from wholesale telcom carriers on a take or pay basis and then resell th=
em to retail customers. Bluewater is responsible for marketing the minutes t=
o the retail customers, and all volume and price risk for the minutes.

        I developed for Bluewater a model that allows them to structure thei=
r prepaid calling cards to maximize profitability while minimizing volume ri=
sk. The model uses their historical calling profiles and allows them to comp=
ute the expected profitability of a given calling card platform. The model u=
tilizes statistics as well optimization theory.

        My current  working relationship with Bluewater is a licensing aggre=
ment which allows them to use my model on an ongoing basis. They pay me a pe=
rcentage of their monthly revenues for use of the model. As they collect mor=
e data from their switch I am occasionally asked to recalibrate the model (a=
bout once every 2 months).=20

        That is the extent of my envolvment with Bluewater.=20

Brad=20
