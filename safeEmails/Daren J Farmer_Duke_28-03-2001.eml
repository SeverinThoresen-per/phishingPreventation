On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to Duke Energy Field Services at Waha.  However, I=20
entered the deal (#603484) under Duke Energy Marketing (Can you believe I=20
made a mistake?).  To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under=20
DEFS. =20

Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done.

Sorry for the extra work.
