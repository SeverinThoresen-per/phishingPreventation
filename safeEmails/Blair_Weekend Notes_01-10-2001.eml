	Robert, was there a problem getting the weekend notes out last night?  Shel=
ley
	pulls the recap for each pipe by 7:30 a.m. for Stan's staff meeting on Mond=
ays.

	I just need to make sure everyone understands the urgency (especially on Mo=
ndays)
	to have the updates sent Sunday night.

	Thanks. Lynn
