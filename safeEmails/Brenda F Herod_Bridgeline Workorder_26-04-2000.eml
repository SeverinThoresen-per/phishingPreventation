Subject: Bridgeline Workorder

I have some information on the e-workorders (EHURR and EHSET) that were set=20
up to track the costs of Bridgeline.  Apparently the workorders themselves=20
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in MSA.  We hav=
e=20
corrected the workorder set-ups and they should be working now.  As for prio=
r=20
costs, I think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that w=
e=20
attempted to code to EHURR and EHSET, and then book an entry in April that=20
would reclass them to the workorders.  We would then be able to see all the=20
costs associated with the project, as you wanted to do from the beginning, =20
and code any future costs directly to the workorders.  I will let you know=20
more when I finalize that this can really be done, I just wanted to keep you=
=20
updated on the progress.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Brian=20
