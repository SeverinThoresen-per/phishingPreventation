I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said=20
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing=20
separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that=20
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance=20
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have bee=
n=20
amortizing it each month as its been paid. =20

Let me know if you need anything else.
Ben
