	John and Terry, could you check into having a Business Objects report done =
for all groupings with
	the following information.


		Previous Cyclce Nomination	Current Nomination	Confirmation	Schedule

	Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report.

	The reason for the report  - Gas Control needs to know what changes have ta=
ken place and
	this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report.

	If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know.  I wou=
ld like to be
	able run this report during cycle.  (I think I am probably asking for the m=
oon), but that
	would be the best time for Gas Control.

	Thanks. Lynn
