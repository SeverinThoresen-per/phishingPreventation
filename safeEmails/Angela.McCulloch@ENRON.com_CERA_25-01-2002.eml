Title: Iran: Conservatives Fighting Hard Against the Tide
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2952;


***********************************************************************

IRAN'S POLITICAL MAP AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INVESTORS

Reading Iran's political map--always complex--is more so now because of the
contradictory nature of the short-term and long-term trends. The short term
offers tension and setbacks to the pro-reform elements. The long term offers
the potential for genuine change in the Iranian political scene.

*  Political tension is the result of Iran's peculiar and essentially unstab=
le
power structure.

*  Despite the setbacks dealt to the reformist agenda defended by the Irania=
n
president, the conservatives are fighting against the tide.

*  In the short term the political tensions might delay the signing of some
contracts in the oil and gas sector and postpone foreign investment.
