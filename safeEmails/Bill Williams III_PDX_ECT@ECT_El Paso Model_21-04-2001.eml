Group,

For the third day in a row (4th time this week) I have received an email or =
call from Kathy at EPE asking the model to be resent because of simple error=
s.  Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking out wit=
h counterparties and running the CARP.  The ancillary service (spin) deals n=
eed to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular d=
eal entry summary.  We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriate=
 (which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston tri=
es to check out March and April).  We do a good job trading for EPE and mana=
ging their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for th=
is customer on deal entry.  I continue to see the same mistakes which sugges=
ts that procedure questions exist.  Please ask myself or a senior member of =
the group if you have any questions.  I look for us to improve going forward=
=2E

Thanks,

Bill
