Phillip,

I wanted to try to set up an appointment with you regarding any opportunitie=
s on the gas desk.

I have worked for Jean Mrha, Greg Woulfe and Jim Fallon managing the adverti=
sing trading in EBS and formerly on the Coal desk for Dan Reck and George Mc=
Clellan.

How does your schedule look this afternoon or Friday?

Thanks for your time,

Erik Simpson
