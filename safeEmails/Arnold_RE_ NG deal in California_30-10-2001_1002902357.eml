=20
what do you think of the fact that production is disappointing?
=20
that fact is keeping some from selling more (my guys).. but i argue that its=
 already priced into the curve.. and economic outlook overwhelms..

sorry not to send this earlier..

i checked out the dept water resources site.. (wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothin=
g too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $3=
00 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs assoc=
iated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings t=
o consumers (gotta love that).

we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. =
checking what happened there.  we know that there were 54 contracts signed .=
=2E half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like f=
or 10 years).  some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas sup=
plies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty =
sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day i=
n gas terms.  If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal th=
ey just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to f=
latten further to do more..

they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to da=
te it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into th=
e grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is =
anything beyond 3 months).

it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. =
Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to bu=
y 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet.

=20

=20

Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily...=20

mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-te=
rm contracts.=20

over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying  Cal 02 Nymex Calls=
 and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size

This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that t=
hey were "looking at ways to expand its gas purchases".

The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking t=
o purchase.=20

Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal....=20
Last week:=20
Cal 02 =3D 9 cents    Cal 03 =3D 20 cents=20

Today=20
Cal 02 =3D 18.5 cents   Cal 03 =3D 22 cents....so the spread has moved from =
11 cent  contango  to 3.5 cents.=20

<<102401.pdf>>=20

Other than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow=
 we are seeing is : sellers of vol.=20
Last night settles:=20
Cal 02 vol  51.5% and Cal 03 vol 37.25% - and we are 1 % lower in Cal 02 sin=
ce the open , and 0.5 % lower Cal 03.=20
