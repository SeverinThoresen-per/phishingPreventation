Sounds good. I was thinking the same about a template in excel for a interim=
 fix. Maybe one of the assistants knows who we would order the old tickets f=
rom. We could design new tickets with the duplicate feature they had. If an =
internal company (ie: The Image Center) produced them, we may have to go to =
a outside printer. Anyway, this is by no means urgent, but I believe it will=
 eventually be a necessary cost of business.

Good question,

I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessar=
y info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet=
 per trade.  What do you think? =20
