I am serving as a Board Member for the Houston Children's Chorus.  The Choru=
s is presenting a Children's Commemorative Concert on Sunday October 14 th a=
t Grace Presbyterian Church and has requested corporate underwriting in the =
amount of $ 5,000 for the event.  Proceeds from a free-will offering will be=
 given to the Red Cross education fund of the children whose parents died in=
 the September 11 New York tragedy.

Mr. Steve Roddy has sent correspondence to your office in this regard, and I=
 hope that you will give his request serious consideration.

Thank you,
Arthur Goldsmith
