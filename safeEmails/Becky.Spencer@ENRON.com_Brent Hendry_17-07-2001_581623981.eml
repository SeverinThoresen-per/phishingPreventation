Brent will be leaving around 3:00 p.m. today.  Since last week when he picke=
d up his two flood-repaired cars, they have been in the shop 5 times with in=
termittent problems.   Last night he was stranded at Kroger until 10:30 p.m.=
 waiting for a tow truck!   Does anyone want to buy two cars (discounted, of=
 course)?
