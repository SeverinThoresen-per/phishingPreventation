Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entered=
=20
into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. ("MDC") and Cooney-Midway=20
Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase). =20
The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given=20
notice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).=
 =20
I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporates=20
changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   Davi=
d=20
Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incorporate=20
some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send his=20
redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and then sen=
d=20
a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week or so an=
d=20
then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is in agreement=
=20
with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that Cooney-Midway=
=20
Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an=20
interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we=20
will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vote.  This is=20
because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre.  There are=20
three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but the 3rd tract=
=20
is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped land for a=20
retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we jus=
t=20
secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those and=20
can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft and=
=20
has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the=
=20
city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the evenin=
g=20
of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send them a=20
note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out with=20
the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to keep in=20
mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that will be=20
approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to=20
negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle for=20
$1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie has=20
prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has drafte=
d=20
a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any=20
power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The=20
problem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air=20
permit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental=20
Protection ("DEP").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and=20
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to=20
reasonable rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit=20
approvals; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated=
=20
to BC.   Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a lega=
l=20
opinion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something=20
that is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became=20
quite the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass=
=20
special acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but=20
the legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After=20
that, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a=20
charter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not=20
inconsistent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they=20
repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said the=
y=20
would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is,=20
the DEP has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits=20
for power plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My=20
recommendation is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us=
=20
get a memo together, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they=20
don't have the right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is =
2=20
p.m. on June 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers=20
Agreement.  Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to=20
the attorney and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly=20
support us as this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may=
=20
come to his senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance=20
will be costly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DE=
P=20
to issue a "declaratory statement" and it is likely that statement would say=
=20
that state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history=20
intensive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will=20
come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the same=
=20
who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say=20
over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the=20
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's=20
agreement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in=20
Deerfield.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in=20
lieu of taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which=
=20
is basically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business=20
coming into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on=20
our property.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because=20
if they are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties,=20
that creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very=20
do-able, we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio=20
tower agreements and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a "fire=
=20
service fee" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of=20
negative publicity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond wit=
h=20
an editorial in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they=
=20
have been sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in=20
Deerfield is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well. =20

I'll copy my notes for you.  THANK YOU for covering for me.  Here are =20
numbers you can send e-mails to or call and leave a message:

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011 49 8218 89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011 49 8232 8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.=
de

Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak pretty good=20
English and Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena doesn't speak it very well so ask=20
for Walter.  Bavaria is 7 hours ahead of Houston. =20
