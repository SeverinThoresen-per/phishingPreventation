Julia:

The EGM group is delivering to you this afternoon completed matrices for all=
 of our material physical trading contract forms and selected counterparty-s=
pecific contracts, in each case organized by commodity traded.=20

Just a few things to note: (i) we have not included in our review the EGM tr=
ading contract forms for Japan, Australia and Singapore due to the time cons=
traints (please advise if you would like matrices done for those offices); (=
ii) we have not included a review of trading contract forms used by EGM-rela=
ted entities in Europe as we assumed that Justin Boyd's team (I left a messa=
ge for Justin this morning, but I did not get a confirmation back) would han=
dle; and (iii) finally, we are not attaching the templates to the matrices, =
but we can certainly provide them if and when needed.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Alan
