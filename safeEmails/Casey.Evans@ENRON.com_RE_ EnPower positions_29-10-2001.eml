Tom,

The East Peak number looks pretty accurate, but the Off-Peak is WAY off....y=
ou have us short (31,458,553) and our records show us short only (8,855,367)=
=2E  I would recommend that you maybe run your adhoc query again for off-pea=
k.  The difference is so large that I don't know what else it could be other=
 than an error in the query inputs.  Give me a ring if you still come up wit=
h the same answer and we'll walk through your query together.

Thanks.
Casey

Also, could you please include Andrea Dahlke and Tom Chapman on all Position=
 related e-mails.  Thanks!

All, the numbers below are from EnPower Adhoc (commodity only and without an=
cillary curve positions) for EOD 10/26. Please confirm if these are consiste=
nt with your reports -- we want to be able to use these numbers for the DPR.

Also note, these do not include positions outside EnPower; I'll pull those s=
preadsheet positions from RiskTrac.

Thanks.
- Tom
