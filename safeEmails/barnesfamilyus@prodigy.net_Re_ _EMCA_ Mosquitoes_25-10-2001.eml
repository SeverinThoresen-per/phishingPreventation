thanks to everyone.  Ultimately, Nathalie's suggestion appears to be the
most effective and the most desirable, as there are no harmful chemicals
emitted from the contraption.

If anyone else is interested in the Mosquito Magnet, there are two websites
that I found:

www.mosquitomagnet.com
and
www.skeeter-beater.com

also, A-B Gas, on West 18th (713-682-5555) sells them - he can have you one
in 3-4 days.

> Ultraviolet high voltage traps work very well.  If the problem is severe
put in more than one.  Place at least 20 feet away from the area you
normally use and install in an elevated location.  Leave on 24 hours a day.
