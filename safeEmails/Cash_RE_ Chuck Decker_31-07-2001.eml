I don't know if you heard, but Kim and I spoke with him, and he is ok with e=
verything.  I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would ap=
preciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it=
 to Kim and me for review and placement in the file.  Thanks!

Michelle -

This is weird, but he signed today and said he would coordinate with Kim Mel=
odick to get in touch with you for you to explain the intent of Section 5.5.=
  He indicated that he had a 7 day out provision in case he did not get comf=
ortable.  When I indicated that I could explore the possibility of offering =
an agreement without the language but at 1/2 the pay-out I think he got scar=
ed.  I think he must have another opportunity in the wings that he does not =
want to miss. =20

Please let me know the outcome.

Rogers

Kim/Michelle -

Chuck will be contacting you on the non-solicitation language.  I asked him =
to coordinate directly as I am in meetings all day and would just hold up th=
e process.=20

Chuck started out y-day indicating that he just could not live with the lang=
uage and then this am I told him that If he couldn't live with the language =
I would ask whether or not we could offer them the 1/2 Restructuring package=
=2E  when he realized that he may be stuck with a package that would yield 1=
/2 the $$$ he changed his tune.  Now he is saying that all he needs is assur=
ance that our intent is not to keep him out of work at a competitor.  In fac=
t, he said he REALLY wanted to sign this today. =20

I think all we need to do is explain our intent with the non-solicitation la=
nguage.  I do not feel we should change the language for him but would like =
to see us come to an agreement.

Thanks,
Rogers
