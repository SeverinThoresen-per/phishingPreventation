Hello Vince and Shirley,

Thank you so much for your patience as I tried to shuffle dates and events=20
around!  I have some great news.  I was able to secure a room on campus at=20
the Faculty Club for the presentation on Monday October 16th at 7:00 - 9:00.=
 =20
That should work out perfectly as far as being about to present at the=20
seminar from 3:30 - 5:00.  Furthermore, I was able to adjust the resume drop=
=20
dates so that we have through the week of the 16th for students to submit=20
their resumes.

I will go into more detail about this tomorrow at the Cal Berkeley Team=20
Meeting.  I have put together some booklets to hand out to the team=20
tomorrow.  Vince, I have put some time into the agenda for you to welcome th=
e=20
team and get everyone excited about Cal recruiting this Fall.  Thank you for=

like me to add to the agenda for tomorrow.
