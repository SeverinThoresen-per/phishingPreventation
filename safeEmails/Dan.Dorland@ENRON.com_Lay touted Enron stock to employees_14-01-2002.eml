Lay touted Enron stock to employees=20
Growth 'has never been more certain,' former chairman of failed energy trade=
r said in e-mails: Messages released
The Associated Press=20
WASHINGTON - In a pair of e-mails to his employees in August, the chairman o=
f now-bankrupt Enron Corp. touted the company's stock and declared that the =
energy trader giant's growth "has never been more certain."
"Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been =
more robust. ... We have the finest organization in American business today,=
" Ken Lay said in an Aug. 14 e-mail just two months before Enron's long-hidd=
en financial problems surfaced.
In an Aug. 27 e-mail, Mr. Lay announced the details of an employee stock opt=
ion program that spoke of "a significantly higher price" for Enron stock in =
the future. Selling for US$37 a share in August, Enron stock now sells at US=
68=A2. The stock was at US$83 a year ago.
"It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was pro=
spering and that its stock price would rise," Rep. Henry Waxman, the ranking=
 Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said in a letter Saturda=
y to Mr. Lay.
Mr. Waxman released the e-mails along with the letter to Mr. Lay, whose poli=
tical donations along with those of other Enron executives have made the com=
pany U.S. President George W. Bush's biggest financial supporter through two=
 governor's races and the presidential election.
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said the picture for the company was solid =
in August and that financial problems didn't become clear until later.
"Ken Lay was telling the truth" in August, said Mr. Palmer. "We had had 21 c=
onsecutive quarters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive quart=
ers of volume growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in better sh=
ape."
On Oct. 16, the company acknowledged hundreds of millions of dollars in thir=
d-quarter losses and a billion-dollar writedown of its equity, a belated adm=
ission that touched off a crisis in investor confidence and sent the company=
 careening toward bankruptcy. The company for several years had kept huge am=
ounts of debt off the company's books in partnerships that had been set up b=
y Enron executives, who collected millions of dollars from the partnerships.
Declaring that Mr. Lay sold US$40-million of Enron stock between January and=
 August last year, Mr. Waxman demanded to know whether Mr. Lay was aware of =
the company's financial vulnerabilities.
"If you were not aware of this, please explain whether this was because Jeff=
rey Skilling or other executives withheld that information from you," Mr. Wa=
xman wrote. Mr. Skilling had abruptly left the company in August after just =
six months as president and CEO.
In one of the August e-mails to employees, Mr. Lay said he regretted Mr. Ski=
lling's "resignation. ... Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his dec=
ision is voluntary."
Mr. Palmer said "all of those partnerships had been through review processes=
 and approval processes that were set up with and in many cases worked out w=
ith Arthur Andersen as our outside auditors, plus outside legal counsel."
The Enron spokesman said problems with the partnerships were brought to ligh=
t "as the result of our investigation. We found there were accounting proble=
ms with one of those partnerships and we fixed that by restating those earni=
ngs and that was not knowledge we had in August."
