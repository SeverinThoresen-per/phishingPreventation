Juantongia, per our conversation on this morning, you were unable to move Pa=
ul Y'Barbo's old extension over from the 3AC to the Enron building.  Because=
 of this, we request you delete the old extension (x55855).  Paul will keep =
the new extension (x54173).

Thanks in advance for your patience and assistance.

Paul will leave a voicemail on the old extension (55855) informing callers o=
f his new extension.  We are aware that this recording will remain for one m=
onth and will be deleted afterwards.
