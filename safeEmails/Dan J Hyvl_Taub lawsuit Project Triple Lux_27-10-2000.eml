Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was=
=20
not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard=20
opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost th=
e=20
Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface=20
rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain=20
surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that=20
if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and=20
well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL=20
would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its=20
condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the=
=20
Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would no=
t=20
affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not=20
have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage. =20
