BRUSSELS, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The lowest spot prices have all bu=
t disappeared from the European market, although there is little buying acti=
vity at all as the vacation season shifts from northern to southern Europe. =
Unsolicited spot offers are a reducing feature of European pulp buyers' live=
s.
Pulpex futures prices have crept up in the past two weeks. When Pulpex price=
s move away from spot prices, this tends to indicate the direction to be exp=
ected for spot price movement. Certain short fiber producers from South Amer=
ica are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price d=
emands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to=
 entertain.
