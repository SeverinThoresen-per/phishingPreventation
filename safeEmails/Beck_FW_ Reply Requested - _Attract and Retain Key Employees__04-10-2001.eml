I will be coordinating the efforts around the subject priority identified at=
 the Global Accounting Leadership Conference.  We will be identifying people=
 to help on all five priorities depending on each group's needs and interest=
s.

The elements of the "attract and retain keyemployees" priority include: =20

	1.  resource planning and utilization across Global Accounting=20
	2.  on-campus and experienced hire recruiting
	3.  career development (effective analyst program for Global Accounting; ne=
w hire orientation; career planning, etc)
	4.  performance management (applying the PRC process in Global Accounting; =
additional forms of rewards and=20
	     recognition)
	5.  networking/social activities

1.  Which of these elements, if any, are of particular concern to your group=
?
2.  Is there a  particular person(s) you would like to assign to one, severa=
l or all of these elements?

I anticipate that the time requirements will not be significant (a few hours=
 each week, depending on the number of elements addressed by an individual, =
with some weeks heavier and some weeks lighter).

Please let me know!  Thanks!
