Rod,

What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterp=
arts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take ov=
ers or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield lo=
oks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings qu=
arter after quarter.=20
