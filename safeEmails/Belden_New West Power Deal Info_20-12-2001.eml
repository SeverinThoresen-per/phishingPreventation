Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on=
 the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book=
 as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated=
 to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies fo=
r this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and=
 have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve t=
hese deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts th=
at are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminat=
e our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a su=
bstantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not recei=
ve high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market a=
t much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and deliverin=
g these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have. =
 We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfi=
ll additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated tha=
t are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for p=
urchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash =
to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or =
modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have no=
t been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weig=
hted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that c=
ounterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given locatio=
n are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the=
 entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  W=
e are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with =
one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will =
need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that =
we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been don=
e to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to b=
ring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be w=
illing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve H=
all/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/C=
hristian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot b=
asis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure =
that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Tho=
me.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle=
=2E  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering=
 the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to t=
he prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transact=
ions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out t=
he door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim
