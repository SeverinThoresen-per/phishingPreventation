Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of =
me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have =
happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only =
say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get =
a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  Ho=
wever, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise =
an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like someb=
ody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn'=
t been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here =
at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this? =20

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more=
 nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with =
this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned =
it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this iss=
ue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

Aaron Berutti
