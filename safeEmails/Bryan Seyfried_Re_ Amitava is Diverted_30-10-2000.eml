Presumably if the Eastern Credit Reserve issues take lots of his time away=20
from EnronCredit, we could extend his stay for another week? Especially as=20
it's unlikely we could get Vasant over in the foreseeable future.

Bryan,

Just FYI - Amitava will be diverted for an unspecified portion of his stay=20
here next week.

The did the initial coding for software / pricing systems used to value the=20
Eastern deal.  There are over-riding concerns there I  or Steve L. can fill=20
you in on if you like.  Problem could be Monday morning or all week.

We could press for Vasant to re-prioritize his time.=20

Any thoughts?  I haven't checked with Ben about impacts yet...

Ben?



Mike
