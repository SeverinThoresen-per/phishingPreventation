A possible scenario may be to release to Huber (with ENA still on the hook i=
f=20
Huber defaults) and once credit is approved by the banks, ENA would be=20
released from any financial obligation.  CIG would have to agree to do this.=
 =20
Further, we presumably would have a credit reserve until ENA is removed (we=20
should check with the other Chris to run the credit trap). =20

Mark - I don't quit understand Steve's comments regarding the release.  This=
=20
is a long-term release at what CIG considers the same a s maximum rate. =20
Huber will be the pre-arranged bidder.  No one else has a right to trump.  ?=
??

Do you want me to talk to Steve?

I spoke with Steve Saye at WIC today and he said that they interpret the=20
tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is=20
the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He=
=20
also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the=20
release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He=20
did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would=20
try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release=
=20
was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber=20
ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of tim=
e=20
so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board.

My question is, can we get the contract with Huber signed prior to receiving=
=20
the bank approval for the WIC peice?

Mark
