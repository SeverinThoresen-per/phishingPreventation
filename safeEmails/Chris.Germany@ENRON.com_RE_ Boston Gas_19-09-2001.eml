The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand t=
he contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you=
 need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Bos=
ton Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of =
the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my inv=
oicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the=
 day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  P=
lease send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accou=
nting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late=
 with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need=
 August and September.  Did you say you also need July? =20

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a=
 beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal. =
 There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  =
I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

Chris, I remember there used to be one excel spreadsheet on Boston. But I ca=
n't find any on my CPU, perhaps it got lost when they upgraded my CPU. Do yo=
u have it? Let me know what we need to do. Thanks.

Kimat

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would upd=

would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.
