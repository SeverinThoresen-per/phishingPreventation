rick,
David's review should be in his file in Houston, but, if not, I should be ab=
le to retrieve it.    Generally, I believe he has done a good job.  I contin=
ued to emphasize that he had to find avenues to use his technical strenght t=
o influence the firm's behaviour rather than expecting it to be enough to be=
 right. and that he needed to proactively communicate with other groups, lik=
e ops and commercial, with an eye toward empathy for their stance on content=
ious issues.=20
I also said that he continues to be a viable candidate for promotion at year=
 end.
Thoughts?
Ted=20
