Per Chris' memo below, it appears to me the question we need to be asking is=
=20
this:
Was this contract number from CES (columbia gulf k#64502) valued in the=20
original deal?  Originally Chris was told that this contract was a volumetri=
c=20
FT contract, when in fact it is a 100% demand charge contract.  Since it is =
a=20
deal tied to the Devon production, I don't know how (or if) it was valued by=
=20
us.  Theoretically, we could have taken the difference between the max IT=20
rate (which is what we get to deduct from the producers' price) and the=20
amount of the demand + variable cost of the FT contract and MTM'd $$$.   Did=
=20
we do this?   If we did, then I believe we have a true up issue with CES.  I=
f=20
we did not value anything, then I think we are O.K.  =20

Please advise.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West=20
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dt=
s=20
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric=20
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the=20
worksheet.
