Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The=20
impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to=20
CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include=
=20
any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for=20
that?

The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab=20
CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.

I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this=
=20
worksheet tomorrow.
