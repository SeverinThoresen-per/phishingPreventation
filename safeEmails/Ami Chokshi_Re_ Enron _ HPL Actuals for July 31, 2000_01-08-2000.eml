Hey Charlie,

For the 31st, I show that the Enron contract would be fulfilled with the 30.=

 IFERC totals 2,015.0 on 7/28/00 (volume on the 28th is 61.250 at the TAP)
 Enron totals 1,240.0 on the 31st (volume on the 31st is 30.0 at HPL)
 Gas Daily totals 331.250 at the TAP
  7/28 6.250   (Assuming 77.5 at the TAP)
  7/29 100.0
  7/30 110.0=20
  7/31 115.0   (Assuming 30.0 on the Enron contract for th 31st)

Please advise.
Regards,
Ami
