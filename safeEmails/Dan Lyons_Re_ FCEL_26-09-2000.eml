With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:

1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first=20
draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it=
=20
with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.

2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am=20
aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on=20
that draft, but nothing has been signed.

3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the=20
initial draft of the "talking points" for the disclosure discusison. It is=20
new and has not been discussed internally yet.

4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity=20
have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is=20
handling the "State" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo=
=20
to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.

5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the=20
purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will=20
depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we=20
will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not=20
know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and=20
again request Kay to please advise us on that.

It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with=
=20
the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want t=
o=20
do.

                                                                Dan

Dan, please prepare a list of items you think I should sign off on and then=20
set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team.     Mark

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward=20
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock tha=
t=20
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about=20
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that=20
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide=
=20
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development  =20
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing=
=20
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all=20
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulator=
y=20
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we=20
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey
