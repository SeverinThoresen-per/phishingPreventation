I am currently in the process of updating the actuals for May.  At this stag=
e=20
in the process the only material changes would be the Nepco reimbursable=20
portion of the report.  As some of you know Jody Pierce and Theresa Vos=20
performed a review of actuals to date.  Hence, I have been waiting for a=20
revised invoices that would true-up actuals and forecast for the projects,=20
before updating the projects reports.  As of today, I still have not receive=
d=20
Invoices and therefore the May cash curve forecasted payment was not made. =20

As I am currently going though the month end close process I am having to=20
update the report.  I should have updates by early next week.   If you have=20
any questions, please call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805
