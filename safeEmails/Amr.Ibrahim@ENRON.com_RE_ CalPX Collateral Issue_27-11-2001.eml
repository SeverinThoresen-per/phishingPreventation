This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthine=
ss requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary c=
ould be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a leg=
al opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  relat=
ed to "Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant"  whic=
h allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve ment=
ioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an=
 argument for a full refund.

On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP =
(electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that=
 the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also nec=
essitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is=
 a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a f=
orm of relationship with the PX.

I shall keep you posted with progress.

Subject:	CalPX Collateral Issue

Thanks Steve.  With your input, my take on Elizabeth's questions are:

1.	Must we renew the collateral?-  From a legal standpoint the answer is "No=
" for the reasons discussed below.  However, as we know, the PX will take a =
contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the po=
sition at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of =
the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The =
answer is "Yes" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement coll=
ateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  =
Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the l=
etters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX =
will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the e=
xcess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing th=
e issue to a head.  Steve's original option is preferable, however, since it=
 is through agreement with the PX.  Perhaps a compromise could be proposed f=
or the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refu=
nd liability to the PX in the CA refund case.=09

2.	Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the =
letter of credit.

Elizabeth, please advise if this answers your questions fully.

Thanks,  Ray=09

I agree.=20

Schedule 2, section 2 says:  "Each PX Participant shall post collateral for =
100 % of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order=
 to participate in the CTS and Core Markets"  [I would note that (1) our "re=
quirements" are currently zero, and (2) we do not wish, nor is it possible t=
o "participate" in the CTS and Core Markets.  Therefore, the PX has no basis=
 under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral.]

As you indicated below, Schedule 2, section 2.2 says:  "Each PX Participant =
shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liab=
ilities in the Day-Ahead and Day-Of markets to and from the PX between cash =
clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred a=
nd when payment is billed and settled." =20

Options:

1.  If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Se=
ction 2.5 (requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday),=
 then let them cash in the LC.

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute "other liquid collateral acceptable to t=
he PX. .  .in lieu of cash" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them=
 what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).=20

Steve, I believe that schedule 2, section 2.2 of the CalPX tariff is the pro=
vision that requires market participants to maintain collateral, the purpose=
 of which, however, is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the P=
X markets.  Since these markets are no longer in operation, there is no lawf=
ul reason to withhold the collateral, notwithstanding the assertions of CA p=
arties that it should be used to guarantee payment of refunds ordered in the=
 CA refund proceeding at FERC.  Ray=20

Elizabeth, per our conversation, I am obtaining and attaching various pleadi=
ngs before FERC I've worked on seeking return of the collateral and the reas=
ons why it should not be withheld by the PX.  It's my understanding that the=
se might help- please let me know.  There are other related filings and I wi=
ll forward them as soon as I locate.  In the meantime, I am working with Ste=
ve Hall to get an independent interpretation of the PX tariff so as to yield=
 answers to our questions and our options.  Thanks,  Ray =20
