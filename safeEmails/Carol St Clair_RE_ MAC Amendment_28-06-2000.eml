You are right.  There is no need to make a change so we will just amend the=20
MAC language.

I don't have a problem, but would like to know why the change for Goldman
Group.  That is a defined term -- see Part 3.

Subject: MAC Amendment




Luanne:
Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC
would
be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from
S&P
is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support
Provider
fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of
the
ISDA Schedule we would like to change the reference to "Goldman Group" to
"The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if
there
are any problems with the above.

Tana,
Please draft an amendment for my review.
