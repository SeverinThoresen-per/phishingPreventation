Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News

The Wall Street Journal Online=20
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch=
 of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03=
 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, o=
r 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session.=20
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-st=
ock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Inde=
x rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50.=20
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened.=20
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker =
in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Ad=
ditionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their death=
s are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment.=20
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprisi=
ng level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday.=
 "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managi=
ng director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.=20
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seeme=
d to give stocks an additional lift.=20
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax expos=
ure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quar=
terly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness,=
 Crepsi & Hardt.=20
The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, dr=
awn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being e=
arnings-driven."=20
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnin=
gs reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to hav=
e approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty=
 well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.=
S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he =
added.=20
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the =
coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll =
argued.=20
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with bi=
g companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel postin=
g results that met or topped analysts' estimates.=20
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when in=
dex component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain ite=
ms, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates.=20
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cent=
s a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. =
Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 =
attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cent=
s a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 3=
0 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, clos=
ing up 3.4% at $30.32.=20
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia s=
emiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Fr=
iday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tenco=
r.=20
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter =
loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. Bu=
t excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another=
, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analy=
sts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7%=
 to $14.74.=20
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical a=
nd adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% declin=
e in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily bea=
t analysts' forecasts.=20
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communicat=
ions recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a=
 component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40.=20
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems dis=
couraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings e=
xpectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Stee=
l told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult."=20
Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down=
 the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that=
 some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buy=
ing activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option=
 contracts, an event known as "double witching."=20
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that sa=
id that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about=
 certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organi=
zed by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65.=20
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-=
Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier =
in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong =
Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower.=20
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading in=
dicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of eco=
nomists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of meas=
urements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some=
 data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks.=20
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996=
, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, t=
he Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployme=
nt claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively =
to the September reading.=20
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous=
 estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a blea=
k economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.=20
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is=
 likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall readi=
ng from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experien=
cing a significant slowdown.=20
In major U.S. market action:=20
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 =
stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands=
=2E=20
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday=
, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely t=
o its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364=
%.=20
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late=
 Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Fri=
day.=20

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative=

ate and run certain limited partnerships.=20
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder s=
aid that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these=

lict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitti=
ng Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition t=
o earn millions of dollars.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating =
to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase =
55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnersh=
ips, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently reques=
ted additional information regarding the limited partnerships.=20
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a han=
dful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in m=
anagement fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of=
 nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 princip=
ally to do business with Enron.=20
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm=
 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company inv=
estments.=20
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monda=
y following news that the SEC requested additional information.=20
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it do=
es not comment on pending litigation.=20

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 perc=
ent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transac=
tions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August.=20
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and =
electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange C=
ommission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline det=
ails of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall =
Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that wer=
e run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The =
company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four y=
ears, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investme=
nts.=20
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned af=
ter only six months at the helm.=20
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon tr=
ade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its m=
arket capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on =
the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowe=
st level since September 1998.=20
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story a=
bout the limited partnerships on Wednesday.=20
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related=
 party transactions" involved the partnerships.=20
"Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 20=
00 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cay=
man LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedgin=
g transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollar=
s.=20
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June =
1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-an=
d communication-related investments.=20
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million w=
ere connected with the limited partnerships=20
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should=
 question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain ass=
ets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously.=20
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility an=
d at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said.=20
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only=
 be smoke.=20
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's atto=
rneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill L=
ynch analyst Donato Eassey.=20
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challen=
ges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."=20
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday aft=
er the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had =
sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which w=
ere managed by an Enron senior officer.=20
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with inform=
ation in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kennet=
h L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC a=
nd look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactio=
ns to rest."=20
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs=
 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enr=
on's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to =
Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000.=20
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name t=
he limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the ann=
ual report on related party transactions.=20
"Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certai=
n merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the an=
nual report.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and=
 described the request is an "informal inquiry."=20
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportuni=
ty to put this issue behind us."=20
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't=
 confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said.=20
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and ext=
ernal auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the co=
mpany's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they =
were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading con=
cern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information a=
bout "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and=
 a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer.=20
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepare=
d statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any con=
cern about these transactions to rest."
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fel=
l $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65.=20
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organi=
zed by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in prof=
its in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in a=
n internal partnership document.=20
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it=
 had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited =
partnership created by Mr. Fastow.=20
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly =
connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 mill=
ion, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 =
cents a share, in the quarter.=20
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limit=
ed partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow.=20
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million=
 and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangemen=
ts."=20
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains =
that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of=
 interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnershi=
p that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported.=20
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board=
 was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC fili=
ngs.=20
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection w=
ith these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Ex=

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.
