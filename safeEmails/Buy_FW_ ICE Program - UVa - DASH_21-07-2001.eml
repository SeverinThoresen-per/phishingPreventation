Good morning Rick,

Christie Patrick suggested that I contact you for assistance in pulling toge=
ther a 'dummy' DASH and past deal capital budgeting information.  Enron Univ=
ersity Affairs, the Xcelerator and the Recruiting department are collaborati=
ng with the McIntire School of Commerce (University of Virginia) on a year l=
ong project where 80 Commerce students will research a topic assigned to the=
m by Enron.  At this point, the Xcelerator has suggested research on the 'De=
centralization of Energy Distribution/Distributive Generation', and to this =
end, we are responding to faculty requests for broad-based industry and Enro=
n-specific information.  Bob Kemp, Associate Dean for the Graduate Programs =
has requested any type of capital budgeting information that we could provid=
e to help the students 'get a better feel for' how Enron structures its deal=
s. =20

I am by no means a financial guru or whiz, so I'm not sure any of this will =
make sense to you but here are the buzz words he mentioned during a conferen=
ce call:

cash flows
$ required needed
cost of capital
time adjustments (for capital)

Is there anything else we can give them (outside of a dummy DASH)?  We will =
be entering in a CA with the school/students.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
