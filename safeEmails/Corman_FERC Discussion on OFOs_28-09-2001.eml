Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission ha=
d added a discussion item on OFOs.  They didn't get to this at yesterday's m=
eeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.  Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is th=
ere some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is a=
n absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Whe=
re/when can we make our case.
