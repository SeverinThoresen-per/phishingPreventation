	I would like to remind everyone it is very critical that we send out accura=
te
	invoices to our customers.  It is our responsibility to review the reports
	ahead of time (Measurement, Preliminaries, etc).  I feel very strongly=20
	that we should NOT be taking comp days on critical accounting days.
	As I have stated in previous memos this is mainly, reservation close day,
	the day before commodity close and commodity close day. =20

	You should also be considerate of your team when scheduling vacation
	around these days and ensure you have SPECIFIED proper back up.
	It is still your responsibility to ensure your invoices are properly review=
ed
	and sent out whether you are in the office or not.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
