FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come d=

In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Kathy,
It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-=
check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why=
 is system showing he is long?)
