Errol- A swap between Enron and Tudor for Cal02 at 4.70 must be booked as so=
on as we figure out that there is no possibility it is in the system.
=20
Derek/Michelle- this deal not being included in the system should be throwin=
g off Ospraie's MTM.  This swap is at 4.70.. they are short 60 contracts..cu=
rrently Cal02 is around $3.. which should result in $1M more positive P&L fo=
r Ospraie and $1M less for us. =20
=20
This must be settled first thing Monday.
Caroline
