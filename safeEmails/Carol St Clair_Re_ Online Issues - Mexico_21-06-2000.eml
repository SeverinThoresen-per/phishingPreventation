Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to=20
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that=20
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through=20
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be=20
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext.=20
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement=20
