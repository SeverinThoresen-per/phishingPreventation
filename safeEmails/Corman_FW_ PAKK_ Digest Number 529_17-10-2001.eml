We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our son's adoption city and=20
then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty.  We personally loved=20
having an apartment - it was "our time" with our son - we were able=20
to start being a family and doing family things - playing, cooking,=20
cleaning, etc.  Our life began together immediately - I think (and I=20
don't know, since we didn't do this) if you were with a host family -=20
it would put a different twist on the situation.  Not saying good or=20
bad - just different.  Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at=20
their house vs renting a hotel room.  You can be more "open" when you=20
are with your own family.

Best wishes on your adoption journey. :)

I find all of this very interesting.  We traveled in June of this year
and didn't have the HIV test done.  The only thing that we had read was
that we needed the HIV only if we would be there more than 3 months.  No
one ever asked us for the results in Kazakhstan or Russia, thankfully!

I'd like to share the experience we had in Karaganda.  We stayed with a fami=

 way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers=
 nearby to ease the transition to living with English-only speakers.

The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother (retired sch=
oolteacher) who was there ALL the time.  Babushka cooked all our meals as we=

 I only English.  The father was an engineer by training but was currently d=

hildren (17 year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our transl=
ator - for a fee of course - and his 10 year old sister).
    I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to =
do so.  It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe firs=

Hi Everyone!

The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities.  Of course, tha=
t's cuz we havent had one here in a week.  But, it is so typical for our kid=
s to be "set off" by something that seems so simple, and then they end up ha=
ting themselves (I call it a "hate fest") and being self abusive.  Karly has=
 told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself, =
and she hits herself too.  How Kaz of her....yet her therapist says she's pr=
ocessing everything well and doesn't need to be seen every week.  But, it st=
ill is a worry for the future..... =20


Here's a question.  If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves, does=
n't that show guilt and self hatred?  Even though Kira doesn't feel bad abou=
t drinking the soda, doesn't she feel bad for doing a wrong thing?  Is the p=
roblem that she doesn't feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family?  =
Is this just misplaced guilt?

Here is an idea (and it is just an idea) about the conscience thing. The cur=
rent behavioral theory with "normal" children is to discipline and consequen=
ce inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger, so kids don't feel sham=
e or guilt.  So, would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing fe=
elings of sadness and disappointment at the behavior?For instance, when Kira=
 is calmed down, or at a later time, can you share your sadness that she lie=
d to you?Can you on a regular basis model different feelings (it is totally =
hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration).  Just an idea. =20

What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience?   =20



Shannon, just once in a while, Karly has a positive feeling about her first =
family (such as when her birth parent bought her koolaid-wow there's a real =
 great parent, huh).  Anyway, I point at that it's good that at least she ha=
s ONE good memory about her, but when she begins sentimentalizing (?!) she i=
s reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours, beat h=
er, screamed at her and cut her with a knife.  This way, I figure she has a =
balanced perspective....

See you all later,

Denise

Since Taraz seems to be the topic of conversation for so many right now, I=20
decided to post directly to the list in hopes that I can share our experienc=
e.

We adopted our son, now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids First/Fran=
k=20
Foundation. =20

In answer to alot of your questions, We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow=
,=20
that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and=20
were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest.  Our flight to=
=20
Almaty left at 11pm.  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference an=
d=20
I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well, so it was about 4am Almaty=20
time.  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our=20
coordinator, the sun was just coming up.  We then went to her flat to rest=20
some more and eat breakfast.  (Although it seems like we had alot of time to=
=20
rest, it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us=20
adjust to the time change)  We then went to the bank to get money that had=20
been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night.=
=20
 I believe we got to the train station about 5pm for the train to leave abou=
t=20
6pm.  We had our own cabin that had 2 padded benches with clean linens,=20
plenty of pillows, a table and a window.  We were able to store our luggage=20
under the bences.  The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt=20
completely safe the entire time.  We took alot of video footage of the towns=
=20
we went through.  There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of=20
the stops.  Everything from bottled water to fried chicken.  The bathrooms=20
were not the greatest on the train, but when you have to go, you take what=20
you can get, although they were better than any port-a-potty I have ever bee=
n=20
into here in the states.  Although I didn't visit other areas on the train,=20
one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts=
=20
of people that are in non-private cars, but nobody ever bothered us.

We arrived at the Taraz train station around 4am and were met by the driver=20
of the orphanage with his van.  We were brought to our host families flat to=
=20
get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son.  Each day we wer=
e=20
able to visit the bobek for about 3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in th=
e=20
afternoon.  Our court experience was short and non-eventful.  We were able t=
o=20
have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat.  We were=
=20
able to go to the store everyday for bottled,noncarbonated water (and beer=20
too)  We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from=20
the telecom building.  It was very inexpensive.  We ate at a few restraunts=20
in Taraz as well and never got sick.  One gentleman got sick from drinking=20
some bad vodka, but said it was just like he drank something that didn't=20
agree with him, he vomited once and was fine.=20

The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries=
=20
with our son.  We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he=
=20
slept the entire time.  Another couple I know, made a bed for their infant i=
n=20
their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldn't roll=
=20
around.

One thing I can't express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE!  It i=
s=20
perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane.  It=20
is messy and awful.

Also take lots of pictures!  While putting together my sons scrapbook of our=
=20
journey to get him, I realized I hadn't taken pictures of things that now ar=
e=20
important.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

God Bless and good luck.

We gave our youngest a two year "discount" -- which actually puts her in the
50th percentile on weight and height.  We explained it to her as the fact
that she was getting some of the years she spent in the orphanage back.

This was one of the best decisions we made early on.

>>My husband and I are discussing the pro's and con's of changing our=20
soon-to-be-sons birthdate back a year.<<

We held each child back 1 year in school from their American age=20
peers, but did NOT change their actual birthdates.

Initially, I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by=20
1 year -- but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not.  His=20
logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak=20
names -- the only "thing" they brought with them from Kaz was their=20
birthdates.

The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us=20
to place them with their age peers, but we resisted and basically=20
demanded that they be placed back 1 year -- which was within our=20
rights to do -- although the school district tried to convince us=20
otherwise.  They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up=20
soon enough -- but given the fact that neither child had much formal=20
education, we didn't feel starting them in 2nd and 4th grade was in=20
their best interest.

So, although our kids were 8 and 10 years old when they came home in=20
April of 2000, we started them off in 1st and 3rd grade.  The kids=20
then attended 1st and 3rd grade summer school -- and we moved them on=20
to 2nd and 4th grade in September 2000, just over 4 months after they=20
came home. =20

Academically and socially, they were really still about a year behind=20
their classmates, maybe more, when they started 2nd and 4th grade=20
last year -- but by the end of the school year they were almost=20
working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their=20
classmates.

In terms of their sizes, which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them=20
back 1 year -- I would say they were about in the middle of their=20
classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started=20
school.  HOWEVER, after being home for 16 months -- BOTH kids were at=20
the 60th percentile for height for their AGES -- making them two of=20
the tallest kids in their grades.

I don't have the exact figures on how much they grew -- but we know=20
that in the first 18 months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew=20
more than 7 inches and Kira grew more than 6 inches and gained 11=20
pounds the first year home.

We did initially consider holding them back 2 years from their age=20
peers when they came home -- but we are VERY, VERY glad now that we=20
didn't do that.  If we had held them back 2 grades instead of just=20
one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now. =20
Academically they would have been better off, but socially it would=20
have been disasterous.  As it is now, the kids look noticeably bigger=20
than many of their classmates -- which is incredible given how small=20
they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home.

Anyway, this is what we did....

Laura

This is something that I have also considered for the child that I intend to=

Hi Everyone,=20

This is the 'short bio' that was requested. It is
reprinted here.=20
My name is
Vanessa and I am in the process of adopting from
Kazakhstan. I live in Connecticut. I have completed
the home study process but am waiting for one more
piece of paperwork to come back, that will make it
official. I've also started the INS process. My
homestudy agency is the Adoption Resource Center of
Connecticut and I plan to work with World Child on the
actual adoption. I have already been in touch with
them.
I am hoping to adopt two children as an older single
parent (no more than 1 boy). I would like the children
to be between 1 and 5 or 6 years old, and, if
possible, siblings.
I would like any information that I can get on the
process for the next stage of it, any information from
people who have 'been there' and I would love to
network with people who will be doing this as well.
Many thanks and I look forward to 'meeting' all of
you.

Vanessa

The hardest part about this decision, and the one I think some people=20
don't think enough about, is what the child's situation is likely to=20
be 2 or 3 years down the road. =20

Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height (given his bio=20
age) when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months=20
after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height.  When=20
we brought him home he looked to be about 7 or 8 years old -- but now=20
looks every bit his 11 years old.

Kira was about the size of a typical American 4 year old when we=20
first met her in November/December '99, although she was 8 years=20
old.  She barely wore a size 6 when we brought her home in April 2000=20
and looked by then to be about 5 or 6 years old.  Now, less than 18=20
months later -- she looks like any other 9 year old -- and looks=20
noticeably older than many of her classmates -- some of whom are=20
almost 2 years younger than she is now.

We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change=20
in such a short time -- and I'm sure it's hard for other parents to=20
imagine, as well.  However, I also know what we experienced doesn't=20
happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the=20
same size as their younger classmates.  Knowing what will happen in=20
any individual case is pretty much guesswork...but you should think=20
about how you will handle a situation in which your child is=20
significantly older than his or her classmates -- but does not have=20
the academic strenght to skip a grade later on.

Subject: Birth date adjustments

Just our two cents worth about changing/not changing birthdates.  We chose N=
OT to adjust our son's age because he was already showing signs of being on =
the tall side - even for a Kazak.  Liam was 8 (birthday is 17 Oct) when I br=
ought him home on 1 March this year.  Within a couple of weeks of coming hom=
e, he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington, VA public school with E=
SL classes for 2 1/2 hours every morning.  This provided 2 things for him:  =
(1) he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus=
 (2) he was still getting ESL.  We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any =
neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American k=
ids.

Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville, FL area, Liam has entered secon=
d grade in Clay County.  Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that h=
e is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are al=
lowed to only speak English in the classroom.  He is also taken for special =
work with the Title 1 teacher as are some of the other children who lag behi=
nd in reading, English and/or math.

We've noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in term=
s of height and maturity.  If he catches up academically, we may consider sk=
ipping a grade.  However, we don't make much of a deal over the year or two =
difference between he and some of his classmates.  He is, by the way, not th=
e only one his age in his class.  Guess we feel, as Laura said earlier, that=
 his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is =
as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile.

Subject: Re: birth dates

Could someone please clarify what is meant by "changing" their child's age?
Since their true age is part of their adoption records and visa(s), I assume
that you just mean to let them believe they are a different age.  Yet it
will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that they are engaged
in some sort of deception (no harshness intended), won't it?  Won't they be
inclined to want to tell others their "true" age?  Our 5-year old son-to-be
was very well aware of how old he was this summer.  A parent's wanting to be
understanding of their child's sensitivity to his/her
social/academic/physical lag compared to his/her age-level American
counterparts seems laudable, but I agree that this recourse should probably
not be entered into lightly.  I had a 14 year old in my classroom this
summer who came from Russia when he was 10.  Aside from a bit of lingering
awkwardness with some aspects of writing, their was remarkably nothing
socially to separate him from his classmates (and in math he was very
proficient).  On top of this, he was from a household where the parents
spoke almost entirely Russian around the house!

Some parents legally change their child's age at the time of adoption=20
in Kazakhstan.  From what I understand this is "technically"=20
impossible to do in Kaz and Russia -- but I do know of parents who=20
did this during the overseas adoption process -- usually to make=20
their child 1 - 2 years younger.

In other cases, parents either tell their child they are a year=20
younger than they actually are -- and the kids believe this -- while=20
in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to=20
consider the child a year or two younger.

Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their=20
child's age at the time of readoption, and sometimes can even=20
petition a judge outside of a readoption.  Standards vary by state=20
and sometimes by jurisdiction as to if/how parents can do this -- so=20
it's best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are=20

parents who simply petitioned the court without any=20
supporting "documentation" as to why the child should be made younger=20
who successfully changed their kids ages -- while other parents had=20
to submit dental, medical and psychological records supporting the=20

Not necessarily.  Many of these kids have no idea how old they are --=20
and some "think" they are one age but are actually another (usually=20
older) age.  It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage --=20
some recognize birthdays and group kids by age -- while others do=20
little, if anything, to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids=20
according to age groups.  Our kids knew how old they were, and the=20
season their birthday was in...but I suspect that was ONLY because=20
they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their=20
foster families just before their adoptions.
