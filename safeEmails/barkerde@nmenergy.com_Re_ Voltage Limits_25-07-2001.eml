driving down the road with a speedometer swinging between 55 and 85 and a co=

(Zone P), RT prices $60-90 and neighboring ISO's in the high hundreds (PJM) =

$1000 for three hours in ISONE and one can only wait and see what the uplift

elevation of his ears as a speed estimate. How the heck does one drive in th=

NYISO market?
