Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it=20

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. =

The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a=20
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put=

in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wrigh=
t=20
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days=

we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at=20
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add=20
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.
