Charlie,

I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed =
upon difference.

Charlie sent me the following message.
"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (=
NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going=
 to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average=
 between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.
