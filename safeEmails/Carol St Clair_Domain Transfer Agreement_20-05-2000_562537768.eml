Mark:
I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to=20
the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk=20
Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and=20
warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and=
=20
in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EE=
L=20
was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on=
=20
EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went=
=20
back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was=20
transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure=20
that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is=20
to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it=
=20
and use it with respect to the products that they offer.

All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to=
=20
our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent=20
is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that=20
according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.=
 =20
We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead=20
us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to=20
transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering=20
these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.
