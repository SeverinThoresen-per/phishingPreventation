This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL. =20
However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA=
,=20
who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.

Hi Mark!

Another interconnect issue - 7/99:

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport=20
usage ticket, however is a brokered deal.  I am not sure if it is pathed=20
incorrectly or if possibly the deal is set up incorrectly. =20

Let me know your thoughts.

Karen
