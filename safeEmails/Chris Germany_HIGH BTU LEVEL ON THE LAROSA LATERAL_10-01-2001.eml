RE:  HIGH BTU LEVEL ON THE LAROSA LATERAL

Tennessee is encountering high BTU levels on the Larosa Lateral.  These high
BTU
levels have been the subject of customer complaints that the delivered gas
is interfering with the proper operation of various lines, regulators,
meters and appliances located on the Larosa Lateral.  Beginning, with the
January 11 Gas Day, Tennessee requests point operators of receipt meters
located on the Larosa Lateral to tender to Tennessee gas that meets the gas
quality specifications found in the General Terms and Conditions of the
Tennessee Gas Tariff.

The following is a list of receipt meters located on the Larosa Lateral:
010069  Mustang Island 1Dehyd
010184  Redfish Bay Dehyd
010803  Stedman Island Dehyd
010990  Ingleside Dehyd
011476  Mustang Island 776
012021  Red Fish Bay Transport
012566  Mustang Island

Absent resolution of the problems, beginning with the January 11 Gas Day,
Tennessee will not accept nominations from meters on the Larosa Lateral
tendering out of specification gas and will issue an Operational Flow Order
Balancing Alert to the point operator.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Representative or
Volume Analyst.
