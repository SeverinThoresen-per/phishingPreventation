I thought I'd communicate to the group some recent developments.

1. Gordon and Ryan advise that the swaps for assets in JEDI 1 and 2 will=20
cover our proportionate economic interest in the asset within JEDI. Gordon=20
believes the spreadsheet of proposed swaps reflects this. The swap will be=20
between Harrier and Talon and there will be no back-to-back swap with JEDI.=20
There should be no required disclosures to CalPERS resulting from these=20
hedges.=20

2. Gordon and Ryan advise that for assets currently on our balance sheet tha=
t=20
are hedged with Raptor and then sold to Condor,  there will be no reduction=20
in the hedge or any back-to-back hedge when it moves into Condor. The swap=20
will be between Harrier and Talon.

3. Mark Taylor and Bob Baird have concluded that the swaps can be terminable=
=20
by Harrier if the underlying security is sold.=20
