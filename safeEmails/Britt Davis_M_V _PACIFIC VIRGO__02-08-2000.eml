Just a note on David's good e-mail.  Although I completely agree with item=20
#3, I have been advised that I need to get John Nowlan's authority (he is th=

ultimate business client) before we send this message to Mitsubishi.  I am=20
trying to meet with him tomorrow to get that authority.  I'll keep you=20
closely advised as to my progress.=20

Thanks for the detailed information you gave me in our lengthy telephone
conversations today and the exchange of views.

I have not finished reading all the documents yet and set out some prelimina=
ry
thoughts to cover the areas we discussed.

1.  Experts

I have no problem with Richard Gregory provided he is the one who does the=20
work.
As for Dr. Mullen of Burgoynes, I do have some reservations.  He is=20
principally,
in my view, a fire expert whilst acknowledging he does have chemistry=20
knowledge.
I wonder if he is the right man for a technical oil chemistry job.   My
preferred choice is Mr. Steve Jones of APC Petroleum in the UK.  I have used=
=20
him
before and found him clever and objective.  I know that John Minton (for who=
m=20
I
have a high regard) regards him well.  Britt has said that it is important w=
e
take the right decision here even if it means sending a UK chemist out to
Singapore to attend the joint sampling.  Mr. Jones therefore has my
recommendation.  A potential problem is that he is on holiday from today,
returning to the office on Tuesday morning.  He is fairly available after=20
then.
Since it is unlikely that the joint testing will take place this week, nor t=
he
very early part of next week, perhaps this is not a problem.

I assume the joint testing will be proceeded by agreement between the releva=
nt
nominated experts to the test programme.  Mr. Jones, if he is appointed, can
deal with this in the UK by liaising with Mr. Bennett of MTD, whom he knows,=
=20
and
others.  I wonder if SGS should also be shown a proposed test programme and=20
they
should also attend the joint testing.

My own thinking is that Mr. Bennett of MTD should perhaps prepare a test
programme, but you may have already dealt with this and taken other decision=
s.

2.  Claim against time charterers

I have looked at the advices.  Priority should be given to understanding ful=
ly
the exchanges on the charterers' cleaning instructions.  It may be worthwhil=
e
taking a statement from Enron's charterers' representation who was responsib=
le
for giving the instructions and corresponding with owners.  It does seem tha=
t
Enron was annoyed that the vessel did not have sufficient fresh water on boa=
rd
to carry out a water rinse which Enron wanted to order the vessel to carry=20
out.
It seems that the vessel simply said that this was not an option because the=
y
did not have sufficient fresh water on board, leaving Enron with no=20
alternative
but to load on top with stripping/draining encouraged perhaps by owners'=20
comment
that the last cargo was Cossack crude and the loading operation was load on=20
top
basis, i.e. no tank cleaning was performed prior to loading the cargo.  I=20
think
we need to explore carefully these telex exchanges before coming to a final=20
view
on the vessel's responsiblity for the contamination, assuming it is agreed=20
that
the cargo damage is attributable to the vessel and lack of cleaning (a point=
=20
MTD
will be closely looking at with respect to the claim under the policy that
underwriters anticipate).  At the moment these telex exchanges look=20
favourable.

3.  Freight/Demurrage

A long with others, I agree that we should not pay this to time charterers.
Probably the time has arrived where we should be sending a message along the
lines that the freight for the second leg and demurrage has been occasioned
solely as a result of time charterers' breach of their charter obligation. =20
Put
simply, cargo was delivered to them in a sound condition and discharged in a
contaminated condition, most probably because the tanks were not fit and
suitable for the carriage of the cargo.  In our message, perhaps we can=20
suggest
that further discussion on the matter should be put on hold until the outcom=
e=20
of
the joint testing and the parties should be guided accordingly by the outcom=
e.
In the event of any continuing disagreement, the dispute will have to be
resolved in arbitration.  Personally, I think it may well be difficult to=20
resist
an application for an interim award for freight since it will be argued that
freight for the second leg was paid on existing charterparty terms that, I
think, provides that payment should be made without discount.  I think I am
right in saying there was no separate charterparty entered into and we will=20
also
have to take a closer look at the messages with owners when the second leg w=
as
discussed.  The claim for demurrage will be easier to resist assuming it is
attributable to the contamination.  Any demurrage that is not attributable t=
o
the contamination should probably be paid.

4.  Claim against head owners under B/L

For reasons discussed, we should explore the possibility of an arrest.  Brit=
t
would like WFW to ask Ang & Partners if they are conflicted out, and also ho=
w
much it will cost to arrest (including how much monies are to be advanced=20
prior
to securing an arrest).  Ang & Partners are not to be instructed yet.

5.  Your contract with FGPC

This appears to be unrelated to the contamination in the sense that I note t=
he
cargo passed D3605 with "ashing" methods used and failed on 9th July both wi=
th
"ashing" and plain D3605 methods.  For reasons probably connected with=20
Siemens,
FGPC refuse to amend the contract which is obviously the sensible thing to d=
o.
I assume, by the way, SGS are right when they say that "ashing" is a
modification of the test method as opposed to a preparatory step or addition=
,
i.e. are SGS right in saying that the test method has not been complied with=
=20
if
"ashing" is used?  It may be that the way to look at this is to focus on
mitigation.  It is obvious that Enron are boxed in and cannot find a=20
condensate
that using this test method will generate an accurate result.  It is hit and
miss.  I have nof formed a view on how to proceed yet and am anxious to get=20
this
e-mail off to you as it stands.
