It would help us considerably if Vance would include the prices for new deal=
s=20
in the monthly nom.  In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas, we=
=20
need to put the deals into Sitara.  We will enter spot deals with the info=20
Vance gives us.  When the deals are ticketed, the risk group will adjust=20
Sitara with the finalized terms. =20

Thanks for your help.

Camden Resources Inc., Driscoll Ranch #1, meter 9858, price:  HSC less $0.10
North Central Oil Corporation, McMurrey-Talbert #2, meter 5228, price:  HSC=20
less $0.14
KCS, Dickenson, meter 9797 - Susan Smith will be preparing a formal ticket=20
for the Buy and the Sell for the month of October.  We will be watching the=20
gas specs on this package, and if all goes well, we will book the rest of th=
e=20
term at the end of October.

On a go forward basis, for gas that we provide in the monthly nomination tha=
t=20
we know is not ticketed, can Vance just include the price in the comments=20
field on each package to help you estimate for bid-week?  Let us know if thi=
s=20

Thank you,=20
