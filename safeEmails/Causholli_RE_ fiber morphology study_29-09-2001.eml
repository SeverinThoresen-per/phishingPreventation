Monika, I found the Jacobs-Sirrine proposal on the fiber study; you can get =
a copy from me.

They included a matrix on which they would display various fiber characteris=
tics, which I'm attaching. << File: Fiber Morphology.xls >>  Cecil and I wen=
t over it and he suggested some changed, which are incorporated here. The on=
ly one he wants to add that isn't reflected here---but which we need to tell=
 them---is that we want to know why each quality parameter (the column headi=
ngs) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.

Let's go over this Monday morning.

Dave
