Robin,

Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense repor=
ts -- approximately $400K.  I know that Mary was involved in this to great d=
etail.

Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for re=
gular severance.  Mary and Tim Callahan have been coordinating those issues.

Michelle

Robin called because Christopoulos Diomedes (I didn't look up the spelling) =
has been calling John Novak, Pete Weidler, and Joe [Kischkill?] "asking wher=
e the review of payment" stands.  Diomedes believes "he met the milestones."=
   Robin was told that you and Mary Joyce were working on this.

Can you e-mail Robin Treadwell and give her an update?  Thanks.
