Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The=20
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need=20
inserted.THANKS

the deal extended for Dynegy and let you know when it's done.

Victor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh=

and by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the=20

advise when you've extended the deal so that Sherlyn can create an accountin=

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about=20
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out=
=20
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The=
=20
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece=20
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal i=
s=20
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave=20
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for th=
e=20
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA,=20
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the=20
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where=20
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for=20
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA=20
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchas=
e=20
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting=
=20
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because=
=20
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.
