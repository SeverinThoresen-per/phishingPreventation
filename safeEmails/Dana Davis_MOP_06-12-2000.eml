Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith
