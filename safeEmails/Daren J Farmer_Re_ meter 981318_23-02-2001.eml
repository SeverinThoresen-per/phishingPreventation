I don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery.  So, why=20
don't you check with Gas Control to see if they know why vol was delivered o=
n=20
that day.  I would think that they had to send someone out there to make it=20
happen.  Additionally, you can check with Gary Lamphier or Lee Papyoti to se=
e=20
if they made a deal with the plant.

Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any=20
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the=
=20
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to=20
put in a deal for this flow? =20

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have=20
adequate flow into Stratton.
