Hey Gerald,

I just wanted to update you on what I have been up to.  I have been working =
on a couple of small assignments for various lawyers and paralegals.  Steve =
Van Hooser brought me in on a big project that he is trying to wrap up.  The=
 documents are to be executed tomorrow.  Despite the work that I have been g=
iven, I don't feel that I have much to work on.  I have been stopping in off=
ices asking for work, but nobody wants me to work.  Any suggestions?

Alisha
