Suggest the following:

"We wish to respond to your fax messages of 11th August with regard to your
claims for freight and demurrage.

We note you have elected to refer both claims to arbitration.  Please note=20
that
we have earlier elected for arbitration also in respect of our claims.

We repeat our earlier message of 7th August that you review your entitlement=
=20
to
freight and demurrage after the joint testing of samples currently being
assembled in Singapore.  We shall also be reviewing our claim after the join=
t
testing.  Please note that we have already paid freight for the voyage to
Betangus in keeping with the intention we expressed to you in our fax of 13t=
h
July which we note you attached to your recent demand.  This was paid as a
gesture of goodwill despite the evidence of contamination at the time.  We=20
take
the view that it is reasonable to hold back any further payments and review=20
your
claims when the joint analysis results are known to all interested parties.

On the subject of the joint analysis, kindly confirm the name of your=20
technical
representative who will be attending at the laboratory of SGS Singapore when=
=20
the
analysis is likely to take place.  Our technical representatives are=20
preparing a
