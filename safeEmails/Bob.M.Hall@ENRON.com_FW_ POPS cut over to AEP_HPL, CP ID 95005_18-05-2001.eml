Subject:	RE: POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After meeting with the AEP and Enron management team yesterday a decision wa=
s made to close the HPL sale on June 1st.  Verbal approval from the DOJ has =
been received with the written documentation to follow next week.  The piggi=
ng of the A/S line has been completed and no additional major damage has bee=
n found. =20

Now it's up to us to execute and get this done. =20

Ed:  Please get with Romeo and decide on the best time to make the Pipeline =
change within POP's.  You may want to do this right after sending your lates=
t HPL nom for May today.  Then after the switch we probably need to send ano=
ther EDI file to make sure everything is OK for HPL. =20

This evening we should kick off the replication push of the transport contra=
cts into POPS.  That way AEP/HPL should be ready to start bidweek next week.

Please let me know if anyone has any questions.  -  Tommy

Subject:	POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After a few meetings, several emails and some testing here is the plan for c=
utting over POPS to recognize AEP/HPL CP ID# 95005 as the owner of the pipel=
ine HPL. =20

On the evening of Friday, May  18th:=20
Switch the pipeline within POPS to be AEP/HPL or CP ID 95005.
Switch the Pipeline ID within Global Facilities to be 95005 effective with 6=
-01 -01 gas day. Matt will go into Unify and change the pipeline owner table=
 to recognize CP ID 95005 as the owner effective the 5-19-01 gas day.  This =
will allow nominations for the rest of the month to go to CP ID 95005 within=
 POPS.
The duns numbers will stay as they are.  CP # 1321 will keep the current dun=
s.  CP# 95005 will keep the dummy duns.

Please keep in mind the following facts related to the cut over:
The Unify conversion to SQL Server is scheduled for the weekend of June 9th.=
  The AEP Settlements changes will not be moved into production until that t=
ime.
Once the cut over is made retroactive noms before that date will have to be =
kept in sync manually between MOPS and POPS.  EDI for retroactive nomination=
s will not work after the switch.  Nominations going forward for both HPL  a=
nd AEP HPL will work fine through EDI.  By going with the  18th date we give=
 Logistics more time to clean up the past days in case something was missed.=
 =20
No AEP/HPL transport contracts will replicate into POPS until we switch the =
Pipe ID within POPS to 95005.  By cutting over on the 18th, HPL will have th=
e whole bidweek to prepare the pipe for June 1st. New transport contract for=
 HPL, CP ID 1321, after that date will need to be brought to my attention as=
 we will need to coordinate getting the contract into POPS.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. =20

Thanks!

Tommy
