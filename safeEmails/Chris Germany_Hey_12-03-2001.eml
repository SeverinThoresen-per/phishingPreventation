I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was comin=
g=20
back from Jerry's yesterday.  I kept getting a message like "We're sorry,=20
this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers"  or something=20
like that.  I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a=20
couple of weeks ago.
