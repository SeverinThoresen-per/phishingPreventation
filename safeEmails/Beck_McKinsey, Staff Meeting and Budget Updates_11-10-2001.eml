McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  T=
odd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of mark=
et potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sens=
e for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations wit=
h McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with=
=2E  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in ord=
er to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey. =20


Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Work=
s staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any dec=
isions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's =
directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operati=
ons would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that=
=2E  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - I=
n Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC unde=
r Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or A=
lan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start=
=2E  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me =
last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is s=
mooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey =
has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)=
 =20

Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to=
 the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and ca=
pital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it shoul=
d be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well w=
ith all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say tha=
t we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some idea=
s on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done t=
his week.  --Sally=20
