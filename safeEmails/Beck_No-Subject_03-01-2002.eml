Do you have a few minutes to get with me this week?  You seem to be the "in =
charge" person for the Estate.  I wanted to visit with you about the needs t=
hat you see for the Estate and the role that I might play.  I am focused cur=
rently on aiding in the due diligence work around the formation of Netco (fr=
om an operations perspective), although I am not on the list to go with Netc=
o.  I am also working with Jim Fallon on supporting the business plans for t=
he remaining wholesale  businesses within Enron.  Greg PIper and I also stil=
l share the OOC responsibilities for Enron Net Works as well.=20

I am committed to Enron, but would appreciate a frank discussion about the t=
imeline you see for me at Enron.  I need to have a job, and want to be appro=
priately prepared if the timeframe for me at Enron is limited.  Thanks.  --S=
ally=20
