Andy,

I see two ways to do cross-commodity trading that would add value:

The first one is to do proprietary trading, trying to find opportunities amo=
ng markets. Prices in one market may not reflect the proper relationship wit=
h other market.
Develop products for our customers that manage their total risk. But, in rea=
l life, many times the risk of a client is a risk of combination of differen=
t commodities that have their prices depending on one another. The solution =
for this problem would be a desk within Enron to trade dynamically positions=
 with the other desks, replicating this risk.

Note that the second will depend on the first.

In terms of weather, we have been developing products that address the volum=
e risk of commodities. Normally people are exposed to the product volume*pri=
ce. So, we have been thinking solutions for volume risk with variable prices=
 (what we call quantos). The solution of this product requires dynamic tradi=
ng of the commodity and the weather as well. These products are close to my =
second bullet point.

Your example is what we call the gas product with a second trigger in weathe=
r. They are possible and very important for the market at this point. The go=
od thing about this one is that the easiest way to achieve it will be implem=
enting the first bullet point, the second bullet point comes as consequence.

Feel free to ask us questions about the weather piece and its interaction wi=
th commodities. If we do not know, it will be very interesting to research t=
he answers.

Thanks,

Claudio

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how=
, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major dr=
ivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly =
interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weathe=
r. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on =
an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your vie=
ws and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy
