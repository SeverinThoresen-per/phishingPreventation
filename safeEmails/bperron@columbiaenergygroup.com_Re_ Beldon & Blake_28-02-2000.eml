Chris,

We have been shorted by Beldon & Blake, 6400 dths of production gas so far f=
or
February at National Fuel Gas.  My understanding is that they had a problem
with the pipeline interconnection and could not deliver.  Enron currently=20
holds
the contract with Beldon & Blake for the production.  Unless they are under =
a
force majuere, they should be delivering this gas.  Please let me know wheth=
er
or not we will be able to make up this gas for the month.


Per our conversation, we are also receiving local production gas behind NYSE=
G
and CPA.  On CPA we receive gas from Power Gas, Phillips, CNG Field Services=
,
and Stat Oil.

Thanks,

Brian
