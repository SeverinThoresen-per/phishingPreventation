As per our discussion last week, Sally will get with you and review the clos=
ing of the books that occurs each night.  This is in reference to the issue =
of which of the approximately 1200 books get closed easily and which ones re=
quire some miracles.  The goal is to better understand the issues at the com=
modity and/or business unit level.

Thanks.
