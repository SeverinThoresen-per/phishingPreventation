SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct 15, 2001 (Reuters) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker I=

ncorporate its Klamasa, KIV, Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its su=
bsidiary Klabin Riocell SA , the company said in a statement.=20
Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be =
renamed Klabin SA. Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in R=
iocell at par, Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters.=20
The restructuring, to be completed by December, should reduce administrative=
, operational, financial and tax costs. It will also improve operating syner=
gies, allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's =
transparency for investors, Klabin said.=20

financial inefficiencies," Verillo said.=20

ange, Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher i=
