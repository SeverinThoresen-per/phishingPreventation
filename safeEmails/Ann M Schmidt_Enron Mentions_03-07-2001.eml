Soft commodity traders find the going hard - Barriers to entry are daunting=20
and the big incumbents are facing months of adaptation and belt tightening,=20
says Adrienne Roberts.=20
Profit margins in soft commodities trading are wafer-thin. "The margins are=20
to be found between the wallpaper and the wall," said the head of a European=
=20
trading business.
"We are barely making a profit in cocoa, and we are one of the biggest=20
participants in the market," said an executive at a leading London futures=20
brokerage.=20
Enron, the largest natural gas and electricity trading house in the US,=20
announced recently that it is closing its London-based cocoa, sugar and=20
coffee brokerage business following an internal company review.=20
Members of the industry think the brokerage, Rudolf Wolff, was failing to=20
generate enough cash.=20
"US companies tend to be much more aggressive on the kind of returns they=20
want from each desk. I'm not surprised Enron decided to pack it in," said a=20
US trader.=20
Enron says it is continuing to look into other opportunities in the softs=20
industry.=20
Part of the problem is depressed markets, with low prices and thin volumes.=20
"Coffee is at a 30-year low, cocoa is flat at this time of year - I would sa=
y=20
it's extremely challenging unless you have critical mass," said the head of =
a=20
London softs desk. "Merchants are the source of our income. If they're=20
squeezed, they squeeze everyone."=20
Business conditions have been particularly difficult, for merchants sourcing=
=20
from Cote d'Ivoire, a major coffee producer and the world's largest cocoa=20
grower. Political upheaval and industry restructuring have reduced the=20
volumes of stock coming on to the physical market.=20
"The only answer is greater efficiency; lower costs," said a manager at a=20
leading soft commodities merchant.=20
Customers found a way of cutting their brokerage costs late last year when=20
the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange took its=20
commodity products electronic.=20
Customers can now ask their brokers to provide them with trading screens,=20
with uncomfortable effects on brokers' execution fees.=20
A year ago, a client who wanted to buy 10 lots of coffee might telephone his=
=20
broker, get some advice, hear the latest on the weather in Brazil or politic=
s=20
in Cote d'Ivoire, and have his trade executed by the broker.=20
Now the client might connect directly to Liffe, put through his own trade=20
electronically and receive the documentation via the web. He may not speak t=
o=20
his broker at all.=20
Brokers earn a fee for providing the screens, but not as much as they would=20
from execution.=20
"Margins are under tremendous pressure in the futures business because of th=
e=20
move to electronic trading," said an executive at a London bank.=20
"You're seeing the tip of the iceberg now. If electronic trading is having=20
such a major effect on brokers in the softs market, what does it mean when=20
metals and energy go electronic?"=20
The execution and advice functions, once part of the same package, have been=
=20
separated. The question of where these clients will go for advice and what=20
they are prepared to pay for it has not yet been answered.=20
"The key to this business is volume," said Brian de Clare at ABN Amro. "Your=
=20
incremental cost is negligible - putting through 100,000 lots costs pretty=20
much the same as 500,000 lots. High volumes, in conjunction with good=20
service, will determine who's going to get the lion's share of the business=20
and who won't."=20
ABN Amro is one of the few participants in the industry that is expanding it=
s=20
softs business and recruiting.=20
Brokers think more people will begin dropping out of the market and there=20
will be consolidation among those in the industry. There are rumours that=20
Truxo, which belongs to the Neumann group, is thinking of withdrawing from=20
clearing customer business.=20
Head counts have come down since the demise of the open outcry trading pit,=20
but some businesses are looking to streamline further.=20
Commodities brokers that trade on the floor might have from four to seven=20
support staff to each trader. In the softs business "we're now starting to=20
see that people who were in the office are not needed to the same degree=20
because people have got their own screens", said one.=20
There is not much relief in sight. For smaller brokers, the barriers to entr=

GLOBAL INVESTING - Enron looks to make power play in continental Europe.

Ten years ago Enron, the US energy giant, derived its profit purely from its=
=20
home market and from a few projects in the UK. It operated pipelines and=20
produced power.=20
Today, the Houston-based company has recreated itself as a global energy=20
merchant, selling and delivering gas and electricity, and its profits are=20
increasingly produced offshore.
Having consolidated its position in the UK, Enron is making a big push into=20
continental Europe to capture the growth potential in deregulating energy=20
markets.=20
The company moved into the energy selling business with the deregulation in=20
the US of gas in 1994 and electricity in 1996. It now has projects in more=20
than 40 countries. The change in strategy, away from owning infrastructure=20
and towards energy selling, has seen its earnings drift away from pipelines=20
in the US towards a rapidly growing wholesale gas and power business.=20
Enron does not release its revenue breakdown but it is clear from its volume=
s=20
that the wholesale unit - which involves energy trading and marketing and=20
risk management services - generates about 85 per cent of the company's=20
profits.=20
A third of the company's wholesale business comes from Europe, including the=
=20
UK, and Enron is focused on growing in France and Europe as a whole. Its=20
pipeline business in the US, once the engine of its growth, now comprises=20
four interstate natural gas pipelines and represents less than 10 per cent o=
f=20
earnings.=20
Enron uses its assets to supply customer power needs. It also has power=20
stations in the US, UK, Italy, Poland, Turkey and Spain.=20
Enron is aggressively eyeing Germany, France, the UK and the Nordic region=20
for opportunities offered by deregulation.=20
The company has seen growth quadruple in its wholesale business in Europe in=
=20
the past year alone. Enron does not reveal a geographical breakdown of its=20
revenue but its physical volumes of gas traded in Europe leapt from 2,469bn=20
btu (British thermal units) of gas a day in the first quarter of 1999 to=20
8,699bn btu in the same period a year later.=20
Growth in electricity traded was even stronger, jumping from 7,844 megawatt=20
hours in 1999 to 36,339 in the first quarter of last year. Those figures als=
o=20
include small gas and electricity volumes for Australia and Japan, which are=
=20
relatively new markets for Enron.=20
Ray Niles, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney in New York, says that while=20
the UK was important, continental Europe was the key prize. The total gas=20
power market in the US is worth $300bn in revenue while Europe is worth=20
$250bn. Analysts will be looking to Enron's second quarter results, due on=20
July 12, after the company posted $406m in first-quarter profits, a 20 per=20
cent increase. Key areas of interest are likely to centre on its wholesale=20
business in Europe.=20

WASHINGTON, July 1 -- With jittery House Republicans complaining that=20
President Bush is losing the important opening skirmishes over energy policy=
,=20
a political rescue squad has hit the California airwaves.=20
A new group, the American Taxpayers Alliance, led by Scott Reed, the campaig=
n=20
manager for Bob Dole's 1996 presidential race, began running 30-second=20
commercials in California a few weeks ago blaming the state's Democratic=20
governor for the state's power problems.
''Grayouts from Gray Davis,'' the tagline of the television advertisements=20
says.=20
Mr. Reed said his group, whose donors he would not name, had spent $2 millio=
n=20
on the commercials.=20
Another new coalition is also preparing advertisements on the energy front,=20
taking on environmentalists for standing in the way of energy production. Th=
e=20
coalition, the 21st Century Energy Project, was assembled by Ed Gillespie, a=
=20
former campaign strategist for President Bush. And supporters and opponents=20
of patients' rights legislation before Congress are taking to the airwaves i=
n=20
the Congressional recess.=20
The barrage of commercials shows that the permanent campaign that was the=20
hallmark of the Clinton years is here to stay. Mr. Bush may have promised to=
=20
change the tone in Washington and end the divisive mentality of constant=20
confrontation, but the year-round media battle over issues and ideas has=20
never stopped. And some of his former campaign advisers and strategists are=20
in the fray.=20
The volume of advertisements was even intense during the first 100 days of=20
the Bush presidency, usually a time of relative peace in politics.=20
''There was significantly more television advertising in the first six month=
s=20
of this administration than there was in the past,'' said Ken Goldstein, a=20
professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, who studies=20
such trends.=20
The Democratic National Committee is unabashedly on a war footing, although=20
the size of its advertising purchases -- several hundred thousand dollars'=20
worth this year -- has not matched the volume of its oratory.=20
The Democrats marked Mr. Bush's first 100 days with a commercial featuring a=
=20
winsome blond tyke holding up a glass and cooing, ''May I please have some=20
more arsenic in my water, Mommy?'' Last week, the Democratic National=20
Committee broadcast a new spot, saying, ''Insurance companies. H.M.O.'s. Big=
=20
corporations. They've contributed $51 million to Bush and the Republicans.=20
And now Bush says he'll veto a real patients' bill of rights.''=20
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is boastful=20
about such early advertising. ''It's never been done before,'' he said,=20
promising ''a very aggressive full-time campaign.''=20
The Republican National Committee has so far resisted going on the air so=20
early before the midterm elections.=20
''It's a judgment call you have to make -- whether paid media is best to=20
spend now, next year or whenever,'' said Trent Duffy, a party spokesman.=20
''You might think it's corny,'' Mr. Duffy added, ''but it's a part of the=20
president changing the tone.''=20
One White House official said Mr. Bush's political team did not believe that=
=20
commercials this early in a political cycle had any lasting effect. And he=20
said the fact that an array of industries and Bush allies were on the air=20
also made it easy for the Republican National Committee to stay quiet.=20
''If other parties are out there making the same point,'' the official said,=
=20
''why spend your own money?''=20
Federal laws leave issue advertisements largely unregulated unless there is=20
coordination between a group and a candidate or party. But the standard for=20
proving coordination is high.=20
''There are so many reliable allies out there, you don't need to=20
coordinate,'' said Ken Gross, an expert in election law. ''The party=20
committee can put up on its Web site what its agenda is and the outside=20
groups can go to town.''=20
And so they have, from the earliest days of the Bush presidency. The Sierra=20
Club went on radio and television in January to fight the nomination of Gale=
=20
A. Norton as interior secretary. One advertisement called Ms. Norton ''an=20
anti-environmental extremist who could divide us, who is out of step with th=
e=20
majority of Americans.''=20
The Republican Majority Issues Committee, using mirror-image language,=20
defended the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general with televisio=
n=20
advertisements that proclaimed, ''Party partisan extremists won't give our=20
new president a new chance.''=20
Some groups choose to give their allies in the White House or Congress a=20
heads-up when they take to the airwaves. Mark Lampkin, a former aide in the=20
Bush campaign, informed the White House when a coalition he worked with,=20
Americans for Better Education, ran two rounds of radio advertisements to=20
promote Mr. Bush's education program.=20
''To protect both sides of the equation,'' Mr. Lampkin said, ''we were very=20
conscious of not discussing these things or having a lot of interaction.''=20
Stephen Moore, whose Club for Growth ran television advertisements promoting=
=20
the president's tax cut, said he deliberately did not have contact with=20
either the White House or Republican leaders in Congress.=20
''We want to give them plausible deniability so they can say we have no idea=
=20
they are going to attack Specter,'' Mr. Moore said, referring to Senator=20
Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania.=20
One round of the advertisements lampooned, as friends of the Internal Revenu=
e=20
Service, Republican Senate moderates who were skeptical of the tax cut,=20
including Mr. Specter, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and James M. Jeffords=20
of Vermont, before he became an independent.=20
While the Democrats' positions are often amplified by groups like the=20
environmental and labor movements, Congressional Republicans have made clear=
=20
in recent years that they expect industry allies to be on the air creating=20
public support for votes in their favor.=20
A Republican strategist said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority=
=20
whip, had recently told officials of the energy industry that Republicans=20
were not here to defend them and that they needed to defend themselves. Mr.=20
DeLay, the strategist said, warned the officials that they were in danger of=
=20
losing the public relations war.=20
Asked about those warnings, Emily Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. DeLay, said=20
energy officials were ''one group of many'' that Mr. DeLay had talked to as=20
energy-policy point man in the Republican leadership.=20
''Congressman DeLay has been telling everyone about the need for us to do a=20
better job in communicating our energy message and the need for a=20
comprehensive national energy policy,'' Ms. Miller said.=20
Sometimes because of the web of relationships in Washington and minimal=20
disclosure requirements, it is difficult to tell when an issue advocacy=20
effort is actually an industry effort.=20
Mr. Reed says his American Taxpayers Alliance has more than 10,000 donors an=
d=20
is on a political mission: to shield vulnerable Congressional Republicans=20
from any blame for how Washington responds to California's energy crisis and=
=20
to put the focus on Mr. Davis.=20
''We could single-handedly lose the House if California gets blown away,''=20
Mr. Reed said.=20
Yet it is also the case, several Republicans said, that energy interests hav=
e=20
contributed to Mr. Reed's advertising campaign.=20
Alex Castellanos, the maker of the advertisements, is the head of National=20
Media, a firm that also produced a radio and television spot this spring for=
=20
Arctic Power, a group pushing Mr. Bush's call for drilling in the Arctic=20
National Wildlife Refuge.=20
Mr. Castellanos, who produced the Republican National Committee's=20
advertisements in the last presidential campaign, said in a brief interview=20
that he did not discuss his clients.=20
Mr. Gillespie, whose 21st Century Energy Project is planning a television=20
campaign, also represents the Enron Corporation, the nation's biggest=20
electricity trader. He said the two accounts were separate.=20
He said his group was reacting because it believed that the environmental=20

''There has been a vacuum in the energy debate,'' he said, ''and the liberal=

BANGALORE, July 2. FINANCIAL institutions (FIs) and banks have indicated tha=
t=20
they would be favourably inclined to a takeover of the Dabhol Power Company'=
s=20
(DPC) equity by another American energy major, AES. AES has already indicate=
d=20
that it could takeover Enron's equity and run the power plant.=20
FI sources said here that this takeover would be in the best interests of al=
l=20
the parties involved in the project, including consumers. This was in view o=
f=20
AES's experiences in Orissa. AES operates the Orissa Power Generation=20
Corporation Ltd in which it has a 49 per cent stake.
AES also runs a distribution company - Centco, in that State.=20
The sources said that takeover by AES could also help DPC reduce some of the=
=20
debt financing costs - both in phase one and phase two. The debt portion in=20
phase one (826 MW) is about $644 million.=20
In phase two (1,624 MW) the debt financing component is about $1.414 billion=
=2E=20
All these loans have been raised at interest rates in the region of 250-350=20
basis points over the LIBOR. In the second phase especially, the debt=20
financing costs were high since it came close on the heels of the Pokhran=20
nuclear test.=20
The sources said that if these loans could be refinanced, then the interest=20
burden on the project could be brought down substantially.=20
The sources estimated that given the credit rating of AES in international=20
financial markets, the DPC loans could be refinanced at spreads of just 100=20
basis points over LIBOR.=20
Besides, rates for external commercial borrowings have considerably softened=
=20
in the last few months. In fact, the last few loans that have been raised in=
=20
the international markets by top Indian corporates without sovereign=20
guarantees have all been at spreads of under 100 basis points.=20
The sources said that the AES takeover could also stave off invocation of th=
e=20
deferred payment guarantees (DPG). In both phases, the guarantee obligations=
=20
of the domestic FIs and public sector banks are close to $800 million.=20
Technically, foreign creditors could invoke these guarantees in the event of=
=20
payment defaults by DPC. In addition, FIs and banks have direct exposure of=20
about $429 million in both phases.=20
The sources said that invocation of the guarantees and a simultaneous=20
classification of loans into non-performing assets, would hurt the balance=20
sheets of the FIs as well as the banks. The banks likely to be impacted=20
include the State Bank of India and Canara Bank which have participated in=20
both the foreign currency as well as the rupee loan syndications of DPC.=20
The sources said that the only alternative to prevent any drastic impact on=20
the FIs was to either find a resolution to the current stand-off between MSE=
B=20
and Enron or allow other companies, acceptable to lending institutions to bu=
y=20
out the DPC equity from Enron.=20
The sources said that taking over the management of DPC could be considered=20
only as a last resort by the FIs. This can be technically done, since the FI=
s=20
have a physical asset cover on the fixed assets of DPC on both phase one and=
=20
phase two as part of loan and guarantee covenants.=20

Of course, there's no denying that conditions worsened in the second quarter=

UBS Warburg's Ed Kerschner, our No. 2- ranked pundit, puts it: "No doubt=20
about it - it's nasty out there."=20
Our pundits have adjusted their profit estimates to reflect this reality.=20
Kerschner now expects second-quarter S&P 500 operating earnings to fall at=20

SACRAMENTO (AP) - State Controller Kathleen Connell released unedited=20
versions of $43 billion worth of long-term energy contracts with 27 power=20
generators on Monday, including several short-term deals whose release the=20
Davis administration warned could drive up prices.=20
The 41 contracts released Monday were the subject of a court fight between=20
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, Republican legislators and news organizations=20
including The Associated Press.
For months, Davis had refused to release details of long-term contacts the=20
state has signed with electricity providers, saying the documents needed to=20
remain secret. The state began negotiating the contracts in January after th=
e=20
state's three private utilities were unable to secure credit to buy power.=20
On June 15, Davis released 38 long-term contracts, but they had key portions=
=20
blacked out. The news organizations then sued to have the complete contracts=
=20
released.=20
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Davis, said the administration had agreed=20
Friday to release the long-term contracts, but asked to have the release of=20
the short-term contracts delayed for three months.=20
The four short-term contracts Connell released Monday, which range from days=
=20
to months, reveal more of the state's strategy for buying on the spot market=
,=20
said Maviglio and Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.=20
Revealing that could lead to higher wholesale prices, Maviglio said.=20
"It shows the irresponsibility of the controller and every California who=20
gets a higher electricity bill can thank Kathleen Connell," Maviglio said.=20
The newly released documents show which companies are selling power to the=20
state, how much they are charging and where it is generated.=20
Two of the short-term contracts included 30-day contacts with the Los Angele=
s=20
Department of Water and Power that totaled $57.9 million. The municipal=20
district provided a constant flow of 167 megawatts in March and 250 megawatt=
s=20
in April. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes.=20
"We still feel that those will hinder our leverage in gaining reasonably=20
priced power on the spot market," Hidalgo said. "It shows our position on th=
e=20
daily spot market and what we're willing to pay."=20
Generators can use that information to time their sales and drive up their=20

Another short-term contract was with Houston-based Enron Power Marketing=20
Inc., which sold a steady stream of 200 megawatts, 16 hours a day, six days =
a=20
week in March and April. In its contract, Enron required the state to pay it=
s=20
bill once a week.=20
"It is not unusual. The state had never been in this type of position. They=20
wanted to be sure they got some sort of payment," Hidalgo said. "You'll=20
notice, though, that we haven't dealt with Enron since. There's no deals=20
pending, and they're a very big player."=20
Connell said her initial analysis of the contracts she released was that the=
=20
average price per megawatt was higher than the governor's estimate of $70.=20
But Maviglio said the administration's math was correct.=20
"Given the controller's track record in assessing the work we've done this=20
far, I wouldn't give much weight to her guesswork," he said. "The governor=20
and the treasurer have consistently proven her wrong on every one of her=20
claims."=20
Mike Wilczek, senior western power market reporter for Platts, the energy=20
market information division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, said much of the=20
information in the contracts would be more valuable to the companies'=20
competitors than to the public.=20
"It's very clear why you'd want to keep that stuff secret," he said.=20
Competitors will be particularly interested in delivery points, the power=20
plants that will supply electricity to a particular delivery point, and the=20
heat rates.=20
Heat rates, for instance, "tells them how efficient the plant is," Wilczek=20
said. "You can look at this stuff and say, 'That's as low as they can go"' i=
n=20
pricing their electricity at that plant.=20
"That's probably the most sensitive information," he said.=20
Knowing which plant supplies which delivery point could affect prices for=20
that particular generator. For instance, if a competitor knows a particular=20
plant is down, and the supplier is contractually responsible for sending=20
power to that distribution point, "they're going to take advantage of that,"=
=20
he said.=20
Connell said the judge heard all the evidence before ordering the complete=20
contracts released and "there is no reason that information should raise=20
prices. Today's prices aren't going to be affected by prices engineered=20
several months ago."=20
Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bills said the terms of the contracts,=
=20
most of which are 10 years, are too long.=20
By signing long-term contracts in a volatile market like this, Bills said,=20
"the result could well be that we get burned because we've entered in too=20

In addition to the energy contracts, Connell also released documents showing=

the state has paid $402.6 million toward the contract totals.=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Oregon House of Representatives Sunday approve=
d=20
a bill delaying the partial deregulation of the state's electricity industry=
=20
by five months, a spokesman for the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said=20
Monday.=20
The bill, which passed 53-6, sets a date of March 1, 2002, for large busines=
s=20
customers of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Portland General Electric Co. and Scottish=20
Power's (SPI) PacifiCorp to begin choosing their own electricity suppliers.=20
Those customers can also opt to retain regulated rates until July 2003, said=
=20
OPUC spokesman Bob Valdez.
Delaying deregulation until March will ensure the state gets through its=20
high-demand winter months without the possibility of glitches caused by the=20
new system, Valdez said.=20
Residential and small business customers would continue to have regulated=20
rates. The governor is expected to sign the bill, Valdez said.=20
The House was originally scheduled to vote on the bill last Monday, but=20
Democrats boycotted the state's Capitol for a week in protest of a Republica=
n=20
redistricting plan.=20
The OPUC will determine by late July which customers qualify as large=20
businesses, Valdez said.=20
The new start date ensures customers won't mistakenly attribute an unrelated=
=20
rate increase, also planned for Oct. 1, to the start of deregulation. The=20
rate hike is necessary, because the Bonneville Power Administration, a=20
federal hydropower marketer which sells to the state's utilities, has raised=
=20
its rates to cover the cost of buying more power than usual in the=20
high-priced spot market to meet burgeoning customer demand.=20
"I think the utilities are pretty happy," Valdez said. "I don't know that=20
they were quite ready, with billing and such, for restructuring by Oct. 1."=20
