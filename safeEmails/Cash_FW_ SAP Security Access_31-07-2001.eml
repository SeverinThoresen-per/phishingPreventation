FYI, it looks like you are on the way to approval.  Until that time, if you =
have any excess capacity in terms of time, get with Valeria on HR Employee R=
elations efforts.  Thanks.  MHC

Mary -- I met with Michelle today to review the needs of her group's access.=
  As the appropriate way to address this, Michelle is requesting the HR_VIEW=
_BASIC_DATA_ORG-ENTERPRISE role, which includes salary, for only one person =
in her group.  The HR Risk Management Group does require this access in thei=
r roles.  However, Michelle is limiting the access to only one person in her=
 group who will then provide the data to the requestor as needed. =20
=20
This is the first request that I would say that should be approved.  LaQuitt=
a Washington, for whom the request is being made, had the access before and =
it was removed during the audit.
=20
If you approve, please return to me and I'll send to Steve and David Oxley.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Mary,

I think that LaQuitta should have enterprise-wide access.  What do I do to g=
et approvals for that?

Thanks.

Hi Michelle,=20
=20
As we discussed in our meeting this morning I need to have enterprise-wide a=
ccess in order to run my reports.  I run the Quarterly Utilization, EEO-1 an=
d VETS100 reports for all business units.  I also need this access to run th=
e reports for the Affirmative Action Plans and to be able to provide Personn=
el History reports for Valeria Hope when she needs them for terminated emplo=
yees that have filed complaints.  90% of the reports I run are companywide. =
 We also get various requests from different business units to provide ad ho=
c reports.  I filled out and submitted a SAP Security Request Form on 7/12. =
 It was assigned ticket #513575 but I'm not sure when they will get around t=
o it.  If you need any more information, please give me a call. =20
=20
Thanks,=20
