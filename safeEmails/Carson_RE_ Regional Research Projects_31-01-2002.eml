All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 a=
nd UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial produc=
ts only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we ar=
e successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be=
 adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated =
to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single p=
arties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk of=
f with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to =
play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamenta=
ls in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in th=
e information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your =
name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them=
 finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format =
each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder n=
ice and pretty.  Have a goodie.
