Ken:

Thank you for speaking with Tillman.  As requested, I spoke with him yesterd=
ay (along with his CFO).  There was confusion on their part as to what Enron=
's offer is; related to a meeting some months back by our former bundled gro=
up.  I updated them as to our current offering and they expressed interest i=
n receiving some pricing.  The ball is in their court to provide me some inf=
ormation to price their stores, but I hope to receive something from them so=
on.

I will let you know where we wind up.

Thanks again,

cj
