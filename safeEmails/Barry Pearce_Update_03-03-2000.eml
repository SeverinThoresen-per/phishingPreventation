Thanks for a great lunch. I am, on reflection, very excited about the things=
=20
we discussed.

The Australian/Pacifice role would be a fantastic opportunity. Kinda - Comm=20
Supp Controller/CFO/CAO (whatever...) - basically Sally's & Rick's (C) eyes=20
whilst they're asleep (Tokyo support would report into Sydney - same time=20
zones). It would also have risk, control, processes & procedures=20
responsibilities - working directly with Ted's group. I'll work with them an=
d=20
face the 'challenge' so to speak.

Basically - running accounting, risk & controls - and keeping the global ris=
k=20
function (headed by yourself) with a flag waving 24 hours a day - kinda=20
CFO/CAO/Controller for Enron goes Global/24 hours.

The idea - 'Enronise' the junior offices - put an experienced person in ther=
e=20
to 'set the standards' and the tone of operations - and train the local=20
employess in the ECT way. Working closeIy with IT, RAC, Risk, Operations=20
etc...

I love the idea. And I think the timing (vis Helsinki etc..) is perfect.

I think it dovetails well with the current environment of putting the right =
-=20
experienced - people in the right places in the world to ensure that the=20
standards remain high - especially with EBS starting to spread into the=20
'world'.

Fernley was very supportive on the idea. I guess we would need to speak to=20
Commercial people.

I also, on the London subject, spoke to Brent. I think London would benefit=20
from Brent - he's a good guy. It would also allow me a shot at the new role=20
in say a 2/3 month roll-out - starting in the Summer.

Let's keep talking. Let me know how (if?) you want to progress things. Hope=20
Orlando was fun.
