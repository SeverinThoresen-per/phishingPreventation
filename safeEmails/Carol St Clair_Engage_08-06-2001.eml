Engage today:

to post collateral if the other party believes that its creditworthiness is=20
unsatisfactory.

2. In our Schedule, we delete the 3 day cure period for an event of default=20
that occurs as a result of a Guarantor's non-payment.  They want the cure=20
period.  do you care?

3. In Section 5.7, each party can suspend performance if a Potential Event o=

Default or an Event of Default occurs. They want to delete Potential Event o=
f=20
Default.

adjustments to statements or payments from 12 months to 18 months.
