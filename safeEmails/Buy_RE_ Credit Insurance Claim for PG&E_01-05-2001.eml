Subject:	Credit Insurance Claim for PG&E

Rick/Ben/Rick,

We need to decide whether we want to make a claim under our Portfolio Credit=
 Insurance policy for the Pacific Gas & Electric Company financial swaps cla=
im (approximately $74mm).  The policy gives us 30 days from the date of the =
bankruptcy to give notice of the claim.  The deadline is May 6, 2001.

It is not anticipated that any claim will mitigate any income loss as the po=
rtfolio credit reserve will increase by a similar amount to our claim.  All =
benefits from the insurance have already been recognized from previous relea=
ses from the portfolio credit reserve.  All recoveries in bankruptcy will pa=
ssed to the insurance underwriters if we decide to make the claim.

Please advise of your thoughts or if it would be helpful to set up a meeting=
 to discuss in more detail.

Regards,
Bill
