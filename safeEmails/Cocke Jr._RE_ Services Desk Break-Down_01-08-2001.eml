stomers are

In California

Out of California

Subject:	Services Desk Break-Down

Schedulers,

There have been a few instances where it seems that there is some confusion =
as to who is responsible for what on the Services Desk.  So, I just wanted t=
o make everyone aware of the break-down of responsibilities on the Services =
Desk.  Myself and Chris Foster schedule all the California generators, Les s=
chedules for all other generators outside of California. =20

There is one exception, I schedule for Valley Electric, who is outside of Ca=
lifornia.  If Les is absent one day, I will step in and schedule all his gen=
erators outside of California.

I hope this helps clear things up.  If you have any questions please let me =
know.

Thanks,
Stan=20
