Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Ser=
vice this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tul=
sa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and=
 nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  Th=
is is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  Th=
ey would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyd=
ay to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby=
 we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems=
, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to captu=
re, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks,=20

Bob
