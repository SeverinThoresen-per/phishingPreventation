I am in the process of developing a website for the Global Risk Operations g=
roup and wanted to take over the referenced URL.  It currently belongs to Sa=
lly Beck and she has agreed that my group can take it over.  I have been tol=
d that you, or Ed Ray, are the people to talk to about acquiring a URL.  Let=
 me know what we need to do to accomplish that.

Thanks,
Chris Abel
