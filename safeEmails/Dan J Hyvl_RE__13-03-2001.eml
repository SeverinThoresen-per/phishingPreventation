Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the=20
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit=20
requirements into the standard agreement? =20
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in=20
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a=20
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or=20
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply=
=20
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with othe=
r=20
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability=
=20
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc. =20
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if no=
t=20
signed, no agreement. =20
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

Dan,

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we=20
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a=
=20
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their=20
language.

Thanks,=20

Kim-

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.
