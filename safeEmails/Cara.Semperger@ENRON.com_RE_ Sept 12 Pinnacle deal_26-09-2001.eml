I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest=
 because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI an=
d Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  T=
om  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI=
 our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in=
 the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark=
 were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified =
our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the s=
heets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads=
 me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and St=
aci remembers the problem.   =20

Let me know when we can talk about this

 thanks
