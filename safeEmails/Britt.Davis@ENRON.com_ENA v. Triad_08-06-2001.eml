	Becky,

	This will confirm our conversation.  You will make the redrafting changes n=
ecessary on the petition and attachments to file in Harris County court, and=
 have everything ready for us to file on Monday. Once service is ready, we w=
ill then serve the Secretary of State  of Texas (I may go ahead and have a p=
rocess server do that for us, to prevent any questions about proper service =
later on).  Keep your fingers crossed and let's hope that Sherwood Purnell d=
oesn't try to dodge the Secretary of State.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.--Lee, we already have the check cut to pay for filing, etc., but get w=
ith Becky today and take a look, just to make sure it appears to be in the p=
roper amount.  If it is not, let's order a check in the right amount today. =
 Thanks.
