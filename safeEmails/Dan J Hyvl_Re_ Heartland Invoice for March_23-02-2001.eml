In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback=20
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.1=
8=20
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of=20
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The=20
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fue=
l=20
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing=20
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct=20
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .
