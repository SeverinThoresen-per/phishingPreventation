through Spanish history by reading a book by the art critic Robert Hughes=20
about Barcelona, and did not realize the unique maritime power of that City.=

Christian,

I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the=20
Armada.  The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of=
=20
Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth=20
I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had=20
something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada=
=20
was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around th=
e=20
English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the=20
English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and=20
you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's  when Nelson "broke the enemy=20
line" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the=
=20
Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I=20
couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The=
=20
battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it'=
s=20
somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't=
=20
see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish. =20
Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory ha=
s=20
in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it=20
ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.

As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always=20
referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the=20
"Risk Management Policy."  It most definitely covers Portland trading=20
operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple o=
f=20
years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.  Ted Murphy now has=20
responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.  I don't have a=20
current version but will ask Ted for one.

Mark, =20
I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent  me at the conferenc=
e=20
because I am flailing around wildly in  as much as I can about certain=20
Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,  =20
Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as=20
Shakespeare's, the  Catalans,  the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish=20
Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.  I=20
have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval=20
history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the=20
battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?=
 =20
I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map. =
=20
On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming=20
out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one=20
considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they=
=20
realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were=20
actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is=20
involuntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind=20

mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the=20
=2E.....   perhaps I shall cease articulating  this line of thought and dwel=
l=20
upon the ingenuity of the Engish.  =20

Anyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back=20
into the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that =20
we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits an=
d=20
articulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those=20
policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the=20
Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of=20
it?  I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles=20
can be a little more fun.  --cgy
