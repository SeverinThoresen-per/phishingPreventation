Rob, just to reiterate one point Paul and I were  trying to make on   our=20
conference call  - We both  think it would be a  mistake to delete from the=20
discussion with Harris et al  our views regarding prices and resource=20
adequacy.  The biggest political  fear of the gov't going forward is that=20
consumers will see a big jump in prices once the market opens.  For=20
instance,  that fear underlies  the suggestion that  market opening should=20
await the return to service of the first Pickering A unit.  - the idea (righ=
t=20
or wrong)  is that Pickering will provide  greater reliability and price=20
stability. The biggest fear  of the  government - based on our discussions=20
with the politicians and their advisors  - is  the prospect of headlines in=20
the Toronto Star et al about high prices in the IMO markets, whether or not =
a=20
rebate is ultimately payable down the road. They saw the problems that  high=
=20
prices posed for Klein earlier this year and are fearful of being caught in=20
the same position. The Harris gov't is far more vulnerable than Klein  ever=20
was.   We are concerned that it  is not an adequate answer to the gov't's=20
political concerns  to say that high prices will simply increase the cashflo=
w=20
to the government's own coffers (via OPG) to be redistributed at some later=20
date to  Ontario electricity consumers.  Remember that, in any event,  the=20
MPMA rebate is calculated on the basis of annual revenues and that estimates=
=20
are that consumers may not see an MPMA  payout until six months after the en=
d=20
of the year.  Our own extensive analysis and our own forward curves for=20
Ontario indicate that significant price increases  (compared to the new OPG=20
bulk power rate of $48 MWh ) are unlikely.  This is a reassuring assessment=20
and we think it is important to share that view with gov't.   We can't rely=20
entirely on the existence of the mitigants; we have to address the underlyin=
g=20
concern about price spikes and high prices.  We think we have a good story t=
o=20
tell in that regard.  Pleased to talk about this further.  Aleck
