Michelle,

Thanks for the quick response on this contract.  I made your suggested chang=
es and deleted the paragraph about the confidentiality.   I spoke to the oth=
er Networks generalist who has night shift clients.  He stated that all nigh=
t shift individuals receive the same premium and there's no reason to keep t=
he matter confidential.  In fact, it is a selling point to attract night shi=
ft talent.  Thanks for commenting on the language.

Please let me know if I may proceed with signatures. =20
