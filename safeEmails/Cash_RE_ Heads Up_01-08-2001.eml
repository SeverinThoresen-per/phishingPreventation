Last night Sheila Walton asked if I would be interested in being the General=
ist for Corporate HR (just an extra assignment along with my other responsib=
ilities).  I told her I would be interested but would need to talk with you =
about it and of course she would need to discuss it with David.

The reason I'm interested is because it would allow me to keep up with what =
is happening in the Generalist world.  When I was the HR Rep for HR North Am=
erica, I mostly dealt with Employee Relations type issues for the HR group. =
 Although those type problems with HR occur infrequently it requires someone=
 who could handle information confidentially and with sensitivity.  Sheila f=
eels that someone from our group would also lend a certain amount of neutral=
ity since our group is somewhat separate from the other Corporate functions.=
  Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now, dealing with =
Employee Relations issues.  Sheila said she would provide all the administra=
tive support needed and there is staffing to deal with hiring. =20

I expect that the added duties would take less than 5% of my time.  Although=
 I already have my hands full now with the OLER duties I think I could make =
it work even if it means extending my work day or doing more week-end work. =
 I recognize the big undertaking that we have going with the Employee Relati=
ons and would not compromise the quality of work that would be needed to be =
successful.

What do you think?  Do you think we could make this work?

Valeria
