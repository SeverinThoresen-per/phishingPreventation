Will,
I found about the same issues we had already discussed while running the PSW=
/PSC.

I ran the sheet for 6/19 since there were no "West" paths in the confirmatio=
ns (I still see the West paths when "View: East Trading Desk" is checked).

Most of the paths "routed" in Deal Scheduling except for a deal that contain=
ed transmission with the correct Enpower number provided (Error: Capability =
not supported: Cannot route transmission deals)
The "Routing Detail" in Deal Scheduling did not contain a check mark for "Ph=
ysical Route" on any of the physical paths.
Also, in scheduling, the "Edit Strip Information" does not contain the Path =
or comments in the Deal Scheduling Comments section as before.

The physical path that did not route in scheduling also did not go the the P=
ath Confirmations.


Also, I found that when I chose "Edit" on the Pre-Schedule Workspace, it cre=
ated a New Workspace.  It also occurred twice when the mouse cursor passed b=
y the word "edit" without physically clicking on it.

That's about it for today,
Corry
