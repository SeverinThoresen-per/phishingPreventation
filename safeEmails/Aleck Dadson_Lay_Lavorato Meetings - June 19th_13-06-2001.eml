We now have confirmed the following meetings for Lay and Lavorato: a) Wilson=

Purchase and Hubert at 2:15 pm  ( Minister's Boardroom is booked  so locatio=
n=20
yet to be determined, but likely in Macdonald Block)  and b) Premier Harris =
=20
and staff at 3:45 pm ( Premier's Office, 6th Floor, Whitney Block).  =20
Macdonald and Whitney Blocks about a two minute walk apart.   We will likely=
=20
be out of the Premier's Office by 4:30 pm.  As I mentioned in an earlier=20
e-mail, the only other meeting I would suggest, if you think there is time, =
=20
would be with Floyd Laughren, chair of the OEB.   Our collective opinion of=20
Laughren may not be high but he is obviously a key player in the  ultimate=20
decision to move forward.  Let me know whether you want me to try to arrange=
=20
that meeting or whether you think the other two meetings are sufficient.=20
