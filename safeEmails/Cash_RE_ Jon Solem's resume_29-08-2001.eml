Tara,

Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a stro=
ng academic and work history.

Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law=
 school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) ex=
perience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before th=
ey are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so mu=
ch to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical =
for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review =
work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.

So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would b=
e happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal pr=
ofession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire st=
raight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Asso=
ciate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.

Call me with any questions.

Michelle
