Is it your intent to sell the gas to Bridgeline at NYMEX - $0.05 vs any of O=
xy's bids?

FYI.  HOWEVER, I have just learned that Bridgeline's position may now be NO =
waiver of claims regarding storage costs after 1/31/02--the waiver will only=
 run to transportation.  My understanding is that this is a bit different fr=
om Mark's discussion with Higgins yesterday where a waiver of both, post 1/3=
1/02, was discussed.  Bridgeline has also verbally indicated an interest in =
hitting our offer at NYMEX - $0.05.

I just received a voice mail from Hugh Connett indicating that a formal resp=
onse from Bridgeline is forthcoming late today or tomorrow morning.

I'll keep you posted.

Since the "settlement" aspect is basically paying some amount of the
postpetition amounts owed, and reserving the dispute for later
consideration, I do not think that impacts the ordinary course nature of
the sale of the gas.

Can you confirm for me that Weil is of the view that the $950k settlement
aspect of our deal with Bridgeline is also "ordinary course"?
