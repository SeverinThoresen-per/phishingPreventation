Please circ to all of RAC.


I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots=
 of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure =
pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and E=
nron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations=
 to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative=
 statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior=
 members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered=
 idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these peop=
le. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress reli=
ef but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commit=
ment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term iss=
ues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium te=
rm and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

Rick
