I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.  We have worked together=
 and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  Shelley is a kind a=
nd loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.=
  I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and=
 Kim as a couple since that time.  Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents t=
o their six-year old son Chad.  It has been a delight to watch them raise Ch=
ad to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a t=
errific environment for an adopted child.

Sincerely

Christi Nicolay
