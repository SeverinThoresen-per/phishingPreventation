It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books=20
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES=

- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to=20
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has=

after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil).=20
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with=20

John, can you fill in the missing details?

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal=20
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.=20

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is=
=20
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and=20
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price=20
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price i=
s=20
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the=20
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal=20
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system=
=20
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES -=20
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal=20
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as=20
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a=20
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. =20
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0=20
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing=20
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be=20
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left=20
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the=20
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should=20
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA=20
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June=
=20
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.
