One of Market Risk's primary responsibilities is to review Enron's trading=20
activities and provide feedback to management, and management's expectation=20
is that this is feedback and analysis is provided at the beginning of the=20
Houston trading day.  Global Risk Management Operations in Houston is now=20
providing Market Risk with a Enron Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior to 8=20
a.m. Houston time, for use in Market Risk's morning meeting where we review=20
all of Enron's trading activities from the prior day.  The only information=20
missing from this is the UK, and I understand we do not receive the London=20
DPR until 10:30a.m, 4:30pm your time. =20
I'm sure you're working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day, but=
=20
meanwhile, we'd like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can=20
consolidate for Houston management's use first thing in the morning, as=20
decisions need to be made each day based on Enron's consolidated exposure,=20
etc..   We understand they're preliminary, but we work off preliminary #s=20
from Houston, and I expect with the 6 hour time difference, your preliminary=
=20
#s will be much firmer than ours.  We can start with just P/L and VaR, so=20
it's not that many #s we need.  I'm hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds=20
complete we'll be able to see positions earlier as well.

Please let us know when we can begin receiving this information.

Thank you,
