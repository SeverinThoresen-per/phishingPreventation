Subject:	Re: Meeting


I would like to discuss the EPMI/SCL split on the differences  detailed in C=
aroline's spreadsheet.  It appeared that the differences were  the gross amo=
unts owed by the CISO for our business, without being segregated  into a rec=
omputed EPMI portion and SCL portion.  I would like to clarify  the magnitud=
e and certainty of the difference between our Prelim and expected  Final pay=
ments at this point in time.  Given the magnitude, I think we  should then d=
iscuss the timing of payments, so it might be a good idea if Stuart  were on=
 the call as well.  My calendar is open from 1 to 2 if you want to  work it =
in then.

Steve,

     I will  be in meeting most of the morning but have an open schedule
after 12:30  today. Would 1:00 be a good time for us to discuss any pending
items that we  have left to complete? Could you please send me a list of the
hot items so  that I can research them before our  meeting.


                                    Thanks for your  patience
                                              Chris
