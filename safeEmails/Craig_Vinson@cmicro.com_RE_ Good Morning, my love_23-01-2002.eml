I missed you getting up with me too, but that's ok you needed to get some re=
st. Only a little while longer and I won't have to go anymore.

I probably won't leave tonight until 5:30 or so, so if you get done I would =
love for you to come to the grotto before we go get Cal and Marion.

Last night was very very wonderful. Being with you, hanging out with you, it=
 all just keeps getting better and better. I love you.

I hope your meeting was a good one. I can't wait to hear all about it.=20

I love you so much. I can't wait to see you tonight Ms. Freeland. :-)=20

CV.=20

Good Morning Honey,=20

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and ta=
ke care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me =
up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will b=
e said. I will let you know everything.=20

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the=
 sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I li=
ke snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both=
 just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the gro=
tto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I m=
ake it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up =
as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medicati=
on. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in =
there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to =
enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches an=
d caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that =
little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderfu=
l man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you,=20
