Jan Erland has just called me from Oslo, he told me Brent & Bjorn are due=20
over there next week.

I guess I'm a touch surprised no one told me, as Jan Erland reports to me. H=
e=20
is Local Office Controller.  I'm assuming it will be a 'post-Helsinki' type=20
review, right? Is there any particular things they/you would like to look at=
=20
or discuss?

As you know we operate some of the IBS functions from Oslo and some from=20
London. I'm happy to discuss this further. Do your people need an=20
introduction to the operation etc...?

Hope your well, Barry.
