Thanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on =
budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minu=
te download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few day=
s of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-go=
ing basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there=
 are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will as=
sume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the re=
ality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the repor=
t in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that som=
eone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a =
conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable abou=
t the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Th=
anks. --Sally=20

Dear Sally,

As per your request a month or so ago, I've asked the doorstep teams to set =
up 15 minutes with you to go over their findings.

Best regards
