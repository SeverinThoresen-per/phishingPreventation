Thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas.  I agree that some=
 sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the c=
ompany and to the employees.  I have another week or so of living the 2002 b=
udgets, and then I will be able to do other things!  I am saving your note, =
and will get in touch with you after that to talk about your ideas in more d=
etail.  I am copying my assistant on this note so that she can schedule a ti=
me for us to get together.  --Sally=20

Hi Sally -=20

I submitted the question at the Networks meeting in regards to employee rota=
tion, and I though I'd drop you a note to expand on my thoughts. Being at En=
ron for just shy of a year, I quickly learned how frequently people informal=
ly move within the company and their business units. I've also noticed that =
often this is a point of frustration for many managers, and can cause fricti=
on and negative energy between business units. Logically, these transfers ar=
e typically occur into the "hot" BU's and into the "cold" BU's.=20

I think a "formal" job rotation program within the support structure could h=
elp to minimize some of the above issues, and more importantly could provide=
 a platform for developing, challenging, and retaining our staff. The rotati=
on programs I've seen at my previous employers typically stop at the manager=
 level, and require an employee to stay in a role for one year. After one ye=
ar, they may submit their preference to remain in their current job which ma=
y or may not be accepted by the rotation committee.=20

I am aware of the success of the rotation process within the analyst program=
 and I would think there may be an opportunity to parlay this to the support=
 platform. I appreciate your feedback on the topic. Thanks and regards.=20
