While it sounds like a heavenly trip, and I miss Deepika oh so much :), the
chance of me actually being able to swing it is very slim. Sad.

This may sound odd, but I'm looking forward to the MPAR retreat. I miss
seeing you all (except for Paul, of course, since we spend hours on end
creating this ludicrous business plan). We'll take Santa Cruz by storm! Or
at least get drunk together.

Deepika - I hope NYC is awesome! Let's catch up soon friend.

Blake

I am in the planning stages of the Haas field trip to NYC to visit Deepika!
It looks like the second weekend of November is best for her - perfect time
to start your Christmas shopping!  It would be a lot of fun if we got a big
group to go!  Let me now if you are interested in going!!

-Jackie
