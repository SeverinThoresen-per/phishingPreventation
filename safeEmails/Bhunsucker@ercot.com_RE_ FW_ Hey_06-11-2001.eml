Miller survived his first trip to Lubbock.  We were planning on partying
both nights, but we're getting old.  We had the lights out by 10:30 on
both nights.  Are you still liking Portland?  I'm sure missing it
(Portland and the office).  Do you ever hear from Brysch?  I've sent a
couple of emails, but he hasn't replied.

We are all fine.  How is Miller?  Did he survive the trip to Lubbock..
Ha!  He's right the aggies always get kicked in the cohones by the Red
Raiders.  Must have been a good game.  I am officially poor now thanks
to Enron's financial wizards.  You have to be glad you left.  drop me a
line.  Take care!
