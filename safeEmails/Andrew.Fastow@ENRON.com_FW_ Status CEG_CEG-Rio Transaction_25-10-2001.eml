Subject:	Status CEG/CEG-Rio Transaction

Current state of play:

ASEP took the transaction off of their agenda for their October 25 meeting. =
 Reason was that some directors complained that the required 10 day public n=
otice of the meeting was not given in time.

Head of ASEP has committed to Petrobras (as well as to Orlando Puppin) that =
the transaction will be on the agenda for a November 14 meeting and should b=
e approved that day.  Petrobras is getting this commitment in writing and wi=
ll forward to us.

The approval process is that ASEP sends a letter supporting approval to Vagn=
er Victor.  Vagner Victor sends a letter to the Governor requesting that he =
issue a directive.

Petrobras has said that if they get the letters form ASEP and Vagner Victor =
then they will waive having to wait on the Governor issuing the directive as=
 a condition to close.

Petrobras has assurances from ASEP and Vagner Victor that they will provide =
the recommendation letters soon after the November 14 meeting.

 Petrobras wants to target Monday November 19 for pre-closing and November 2=
0 for closing in Houston.

On Monday, Richard Olm secured the approval of the Brasoil board for the tra=
nsaction -- final internal approval required.

Petrobras has instructed their lawyers to meet with our lawyers next week to=
 finalize the closing documents.

Petrobras has assured me that the money is ready offshore to complete the de=
al.  Petrobras has been working with us and Bank of America to set up the ac=
counts they will need to complete the subsequent transactions.

Petrobras has their accountants in our Rio office this week to make sure the=
y have all the documents necessary for completing the deal.

Petrobras knows that there are issues in CEG (concerning gas supply and tari=
ffs) that are scheduled for the November CEG board meeting that they would v=
ote yes on but that Enron would veto.  We will probably delay that vote but =
Petrobras realizes that a decision must be made soon in order not to affect =
the operations of CEG.

Neither party has the right to unilaterally terminate the transaction.  Unde=
r the PSA the transaction will terminate if not completed by December 31, 20=
01.


Based on input from various sources in Brazil and on the actions and demeano=
r of  Petrobras, my judgement is that the delay is being caused by ASEP due =
to bureaucracy and politics associated with this high profile transaction wi=
th a state company.    Petrobras is not acting like a company that does not =
want to close.  As difficult as it is, my recommendation is to extend our pu=
rchase price agreement and wait for the new target date.=20
