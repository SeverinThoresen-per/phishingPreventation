Having worked the same shift schedule that the ISO uses, I have something ne=
w to
ponder. Assuming Senior Shift Operator "A" was on day shift Mon/Tues and SSO=
 "B
" was on day shift for Wed/Thurs. The results of the Real Time prices/ uplif=
t
were dramatically different from SSO "A "to SSO "B"( Mon and Tues were very
similar and Wed very different) If all things being nearly the same, could t=
he
operating philosophies of the two SSO's contributed to a very divergent econ=
omic
results? When the ISO does its post mortem (bad choice of words) on the high
load days, do they look at the operating philosophies of the operators to se=
e if
they impact economics? When I say "philosophies",  I am  NOT referring to th=
e
security decisions only on how the solving of the security constraints could=
 be
different enough to have two totally different economic impacts. Further bac=
k
pedaling, without knowing the outages or Bid stacks etc, I am only asking if=
 the
ISO looks at this kind of thing when they do their evaluation. Ponder away..=
