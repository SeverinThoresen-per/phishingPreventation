Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operati=
onally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB st=
andards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said =
that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L=
 and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardi=
zed data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB=
 version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and=
 I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopte=
d by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.

I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  =
Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the st=
andardization.

Indicated Shippers in their Reply to our Reply brief (at 19) argue that we i=
mplied that our capacity postings are consistent with the standardized Gisb =
format.  They compare our postings to NGPL's, which are different, to suppor=
t their argument.  Then they conclude that there is no standardized GISB cap=
acity-posting format.  Is this true?  How can we respond if this comes up at=
 oral argument tomorrow?  Maria
