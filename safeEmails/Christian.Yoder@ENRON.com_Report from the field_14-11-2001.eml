Depending on who you ask, the EEI evangelism campaign to Seattle  was either=
 a failure or a success.  If you ask Stewart, he will say in his clipped, hi=
ghly focussed manner that it failed.  Seattle did not agree to convert to th=
e EEI and immediately sign a completed Cover Sheet right there on the spot. =
  Far from it.  If you ask me,  I think I pulled off a major political coup =
and have a vote for consolidation in my firm grip.  I didn't even try to con=
vince Paula Green, a bureaucrat who has dealt with Seattle power policy matt=
ers for over twenty years and who is very  much "set" in her ways in a subli=
minal manner that is perfectly consistent with her title:  "Deputy Superinte=
ndent," to come to the EEI Jesus.   Somewhere on the long dark drive up the =
 I-5 corridor, with rancid coffee sloshing around with a stale maple bar fro=
m a seedy gas station store in my empty, weak belly, somewhere up there by t=
he Centralia coal fired power plant that Transalta bought a couple of years =
ago amidst all that due diligence frenzy that Greg Wolfe had stirred up with=
in our shop,  somewhere up there in the dark, miserable windy rain I settled=
 upon my strategy.  I would not even attempt a frontal attack.  We have sent=
 the equivalent of John Bell Hood and his corp of Texans directly against th=
e WSPP fortification (the Shari Stack gambit) and been badly mauled and hurl=
ed back.  Secondly, Enron, or whatever is left of us, is in no position to c=
laim the high moral ground.  We have to get used to slinking around sheepish=
ly in front of there conservative folks who had suspected our hubris all alo=
ng.  It wasn't a good time to argue from the implicit basis of superior inte=
lligence. =20

Therefore, I decided to test drive my consolidation theory, and, had a spect=
acular success.  I had this intransigent, stubborn old policy gal leaning ov=
er the table, looking into my eyes and emphatically exclaiming:  "I support =
that.  Who could possibly be against that?"  This after I basically said tha=
t lawyers could tie us all up for years arguing about an ever narrowing set =
of distinctions and that it was time to stop bashing either agreement and se=
t up a Joint Drafting Committee and "harmonize" them.  Excuse me for using t=
his nauseating word "harmonize."  It's right up there with "facilitate"  or =
the dreaded "incentivize" as disguting words, but I swallowed my pride and u=
sed it with gusto.  I laid it on real thick, claiming that the WSPP had done=
 a great job in the west while the same thing was going on in the east and n=
ow it was time to harmonize the documents and get on with more important mat=
ters, that it was stupid to tie up our valuable resources and time comparing=
 these agreements and trashing them.  I claimed that each agreement referred=
 to exactly the same concepts, only using different words, and that these di=
fferences could be quickly resolved by competent energy attorneys. =20

My test drive of this theory with a live candidate, an entrenched WSPP suppo=
rter who aint gonna change was interesting.  I got her to agree to a joint c=
ommittee concept and state emphatically in front of all that she would enthu=
siastically endorse this idea.  This is the first of several of these types =
of conversations we need to have with various parties.  I am going to head o=
ver to BPA and "convert" the infamous Brenda whoever to this new doctrine.  =
If we line up big guys like Seattle, BPA and others, critical big Mo may be =
generated and, in the ultimate scene, we send Elizabeth into the caves (draf=
ting conference room) against Mike bin Small and, hey, I'm willing to bet on=
 the outcome of that encounter.  I think we all know what would happen then.=
  Think about it.  It is a marginal little drama that I have kindled up out =
of the depths of my despair and boredom, but, it might just pick up steam if=
 it is nursed along.  PacifiCorp's Jeremy Weinstein is taking a more striden=
t, judicial review of due process approach to the WSPP, and with him leading=
 a formal charge, this little argument I am trying to plant could be the com=
promise for peace.  ----cgy=20
