Karen- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs=
 to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should k=
eep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern Enron =
has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we l=
ose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets. Yo=
u need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time. Rick
