Hi Mark,  this is an email that I recieved from Lisa Gillette, who is a=20
member of Product Control and is in charge of the Customer Registration=20
Process.   In reviewing this process, I think this is a concern that truly=20
falls in your realm.  Please review and get back to Lisa or myself.


"There seems to be some concern abou the Customer Registration from.  As of=20
right now the Registration Form does not include a "State or Country of=20
Incorporation" and needed to know if the form should be amended to include=20
one.  Please let me know either directly or via Carrie Southard if this is=20
something that we need to take care of."

Thank you,

Lisa Gillette
