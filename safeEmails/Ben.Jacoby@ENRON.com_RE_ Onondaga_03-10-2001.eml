Louise:

I'd like to get some time with you tomorrow or Wednesday at your convenience=
 to further discuss Onondaga. We are effectively at a cross roads with respe=
ct to monetization activities, and I'd like to get some guidance.

Please let me know if you might have some time.

Also, I hope the site sale information I sent you yesterday for your board p=
resentation met your needs. Please let me know if I need to do any follow up=
 on that, or if you have any questions on the project status information I e=
-mailed you for today's weekly origination meeting. The meeting Heather and =
I had with Williams went well, and I can give you an update on that as well.

Regards,

Ben

Louise / Dave:

We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onon=
daga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our inter=
est in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by acco=
unting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but=
 at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basic=
ally states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, w=
e should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last w=
eek, but then readjust the value of the asset.

Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we rece=
ived this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the "rec=
eivable" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment recei=
ved) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q=
3.

With your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of O=
nondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advi=
se him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Ben,

Based upon the review of the Cashflow Interest Agreement, Partnership Agreem=
ent and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined th=
at it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income.  Th=
e basis that is carried on our books currently (approx. $7.9 mm) represents =
a long-term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement u=
nder the original gas supply agreement between ENA and OCLP.  In addition, T=
his asset does not qualify for the MTM or Fair Value accounting models.  The=
 payment received from OCLP based on the Cashflow Interest Agreement should =
reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books.

However,  it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management d=
ecision was made to reduce/write-off  $8 million of this long-term receivabl=
e based upon the best information available at the time.  As stated below ou=
r internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year writ=
e down was more than it should have been.  This would suggest that we need t=
o effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly be=
lieve is collectible.  This will be considered a change in accounting estima=
te will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the de=
cision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year.  This=
 basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as MTM.

A few things need to be noted:

1) Support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustme=
nt of our valuation of this asset. Please provide this to me=20

2) You will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from th=
e increase in the asset.  Supposedly Corp took the write down....may cause p=
roblems.

3) Somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure th=
at this will create.  It is my understanding that RAC and Credit are not inv=
olved.

4) We need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write=
 down in prior year.  We will probably get questioned by AA.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.


Regards,

Billy

Please book the payment received from Onondaga as Q3 income. In this morning=
's meeting with Louise, I have advised her that our internal valuation and s=
ales efforts support this payment being taken as income.

Please advise as I need to update her tomorrow.

Thanks much.

Ben
