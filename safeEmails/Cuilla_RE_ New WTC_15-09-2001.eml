There is a very good website for getting information regarding current event=
s - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get =
the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings. =
 As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama B=
in Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If yo=
u are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is =
believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (emb=
assy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and=
 it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending=
 his life!

SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Pales=
tinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attack=
s in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the con=
clusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of t=
he attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islam=
ic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestini=
an Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being e=
xamined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Midd=
le East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the ran=
king Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation =
at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved wi=
th Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were bri=
efed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin=
 Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the offic=
ial said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connecti=
on," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, =
as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be consi=
dered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears=
 unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. att=
acks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash=
 hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determi=
ned who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to =
be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign=
=2E Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation w=
ould prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so en=
ormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to brin=
g our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."=20

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it upon
ourselves.
