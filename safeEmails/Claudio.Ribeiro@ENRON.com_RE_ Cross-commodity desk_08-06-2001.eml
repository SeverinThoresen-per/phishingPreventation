In school books we study exactly your example from the bank.

But in our case, we are studying the HDD contract that pays financially in M=
MBtu (gas). So the tick size of the transaction would be MMBtu/DD rather tha=
n $/DD.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Genera=
lly I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst who=
lesale players that you can get positions on that you want.=20

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think ther=
e are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, b=
ut no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serv=
e those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD inte=
rest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. Wh=
at is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy
