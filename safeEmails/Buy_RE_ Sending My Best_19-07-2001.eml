 the worry is did they get it all? Surface tissue of tongue on bottom right.=
 This is so weird since I don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk fact=
ors. Thanks for your concern and I will let you know how this goes. I have f=
ound that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyon=
e. I go back to MDA in a month for follow-up visit (ultra sound of lymph nod=
es). Rick
