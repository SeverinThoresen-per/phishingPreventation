Jennifer Stevenson at Andersen may be calling you all to try and verify some=
thing to assist us with our dual trigger accounting arguments.  We have been=
 trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies =
more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplex=
ed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out t=
o them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option wh=
ich would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will g=
reatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.=
  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last=
 summer, the premium is a multiple of the "expected" payout.  a trader may n=
ot respond well to the term "margin" because they dont calculate it. as an e=
xample, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 ca=
ll is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instru=
ment for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analog=
y is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmark=
et because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really tak=
e advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader =
will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol s=
mile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to=
 talk to.

Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to r=
eview our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to=
 issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet wit=
h them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and V=
asant.   They are all right with the model.

Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-=
of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Dire=
ctor of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk=
=2E  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me=
 know.
=20
Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push th=
e issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still a=
nticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informe=
d. =20
