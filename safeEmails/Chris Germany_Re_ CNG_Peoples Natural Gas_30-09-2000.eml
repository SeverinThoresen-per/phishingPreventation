Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from=20
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I=
=20
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables=20
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match=
=20
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustmen=
t=20
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actuall=
y=20
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I=20
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes=20
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to=20
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want thes=
e=20
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips=
=20
and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or=20
MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is=20
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I=20
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.=
 =20
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out o=
f=20
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So=
=20
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria
