Ken:

Enron Transportation Services Company (ETS) and El Paso Gas Pipeline Company=
=20
(El Paso) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly=20
analyze and develop an Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (tentatively=20
named North Star Pipeline).  Both parties did not want to press release the=20
MOU.

The MOU only commits us to jointly study, evaluate and fund a project=20
proposal.  It can be canceled at any time, for any reason, and is not an=20
exclusive.

The "Alaskan Producers" are telling us they want to team-up with someone who=
=20
can help them get the gas to the markets.  Four (4) Bcf of incremental=20
supplies just cannot be directed to a market hub...i.e., Chicago, for=20
instance.

Our goal with El Paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the=20
demand for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project=20
that would get the gas to the various markets.

Our ownership of NNG, TW and NBPL and El Paso's ownership of ANR, El Paso an=
d=20
Tennessee will cover a lot of impacted pipelines.

I believe our best bet as of now is not to commit to a specific route or=20
project (i.e., Hoglund's), but work with the producers on a total delivery=20
system...wellhead to city gate/burner tip.

Your thoughts would be appreciated before we move too far in this direction.

Stan

P.S.  My guess is we would look at a 10% to 15% interest in a project=20
financed (75%) pipeline.
