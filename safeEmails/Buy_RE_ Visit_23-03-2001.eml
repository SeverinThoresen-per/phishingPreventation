Rick,
All the risk info and personnel are in Houston.  risk mngt and the core cont=
rollers are at Jefferson Street.  The programmers etc... who have had input =
are also in that office.   Because we do not have a team built yet (my prima=
ry task) we will need to pull from varied resources.=20
Hence,  although i understand the distraction of being so close to HQ I stil=
l think it favors being down there. =20
Regards,
Bill

I think it would be best if we sent a team to you office for a day or two. I=
f we did it here it would be difficult to get people's attention for anythin=
g other than a minute. Let me know your thoughts. Rick

Rick,
Thanks so much for the hospitality last week down in Houston.  I spoke to Ge=
ne regarding your offer to sit down and give us some of your expertise and y=
ou helping us to evaluate where we are,  what we need to do and the best cou=
rse to get there.    I also discussed info sensitivity and neither of us see=
 this as a big risk.  I would like to proceed with this asap.   i will be do=
wn in Houston on Wednesday (meeting with Lou Pai and gene and others) and co=
uld stay on longer if there was a chance to meet, either Wednesday afternoon=
 or Thursday.  Friday is possible although slightly tougher.   Otherwise cou=
ld you suggest some time.  Regards,
Bill
