This may be what we need to push the industry over the edge to EISB.  NERC i=
s basically going into a "ignore the market mode" leveraging the threat issu=
e to its fullest.  The fact is, NERC's ability to impact the infrastructure =
protection is relatively minor.  They mostly deal with communications and da=
ta sharing.  The real protection to threats lies in physical security.  We m=
ust make clear to the policymakers that NERC and RTOs have little rules and =
capability to govern physical protection of assets.  These are left in indiv=
idual asset owners' authority.  Although there is data that can be used nega=
tively, using this data to systematically bring down the grid is not a big b=
ag for the buck that policymakers are concerned about.  Policymakers must no=
t lose perspective that NERC does NOT operate the grid nor is in a position =
to impose requirements that can protect the infrastructure from physical att=
ack.
(impose a standard to post armed guards at substations?)

Christi,

Is it too obvious that I have little use for NERC? =20

NERC's most recent statements really get me upset, if we don't directly conf=
rom them about this, should we work through EPSA?  NERC's position is counte=
r to everything we have been working so hard to move forward...CA and the re=
st of the western PTOs are bad enough slowling down development efforts with=
out groups like NERC pontificating publically that FERC should slow things d=
own....
