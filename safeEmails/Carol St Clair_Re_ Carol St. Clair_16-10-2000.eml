Hi,

The sick leave policy is 4 weeks at 100% and 22 weeks at 90%.  So some of=20
that time will fall into the 90% pay.

Take care!

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time of=
f=20
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her=20
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to=
=20
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I=20
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence=20
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark
