These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange. =20
However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the=20
contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, i=
n=20
order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the=20
delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and=20
September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.

Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in=20
place.  (PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas=20
Daily -.10)

Daren:
I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with=20
8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the=20
exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10,=20
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you=20
agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be=
=20
exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no=20
exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is=20
nothing to verify our volumes.

You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot=
=20
deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved=20
to a new ticket if they are spot.

Thanks,
Megan
