Lynn,
All of our agent roles in the past have been to act as agent on NNG or TW fo=
r a customer not take nominations or do accounting as a third party pipe. TM=
S could probably be split out to take care of the nominations and confirmati=
ons but who's Tariff rules would it follow? if theirs TMS would have to be p=
rogrammed for them, we would also need to duplicate a web site for postings.=
 Confirmations up and down stream would not be much of a problem. Do you wan=
t IT to work up an estimate for the work and a timeline? I will talk to Donn=
a about the fee associated with this role; she handled the Calpine agreement=
 for TW which was different from the Northwest agreement.=20
Let me know if you want me to procede.

John Buchanan

	John, we look into this for another party at one time?  Do you recall what=20

Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams r=
egarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item h=
as come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we ente=
r into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service fo=
r the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closin=
g to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into thei=
r back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue=
 to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulleti=
n Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and dow=
nstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG=
, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams e=
ntity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we w=
ould be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function=
 from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't ant=
icipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will=
 also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped=
, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between=
 NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them. =20

Thanks for your help.

Bob
