Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in=
 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 =
filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 20=
01, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro=
 forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No.=
 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its custome=
rs have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the =
protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma ta=
riff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue=
=2E

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers=
 and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise=
, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sh=
eets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.
