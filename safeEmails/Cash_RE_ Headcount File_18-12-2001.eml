Amy

Can you find out from Louise/John whether they want to transfer in the ENW/C=
orp employees not on this list to ENA and consolidate all newco employee und=
er the ENA umbrella prior to the deal going through ? Would suggest we leave=
 them where they are.=20

Michelle - does this make sense from an acquisition standpoint or should we =
transfer everyone to ENA ?

Amy can you pull in Anne, Sarah and Tana and check for all of newco/ENA empl=
oyees as per the most current list. I'm completing the data room this am and=
 info ready for a counterparty

There will be some ENA folks who are not on the newco list=20

Thanks

Neil
