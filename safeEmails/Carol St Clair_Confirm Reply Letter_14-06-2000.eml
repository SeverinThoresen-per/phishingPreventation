Joe:
Here is my stab at a form of confirm reply letter.  This one assumes that we=
=20
are the confirming party but it can be modified if the counterparty is the=20
confirming party and we want to send this.  I will work on  modifying=20
Southern's cover letter into something that we could send to our=20
counterparties.  Call me if you have any questions.
Carol
