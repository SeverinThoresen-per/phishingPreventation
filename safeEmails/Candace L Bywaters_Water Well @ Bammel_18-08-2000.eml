Nathan tells me that he has a request in to you for a dollar evaluation of=20
the Hamill Gas Unit #1 water well that EOG recently assigned and conveyed=20
over to HPL at my request.  Please advise me at your earliest convenience=20
what that value may be so that we can appropriately get it on our asset=20
ledger.  I am also awaiting a response from John Towles as to a clearer plat=
=20
on this property as was originally requested by EOG some time ago which I=20
assume we will use as an exhibit to the Operating Agreement..

Also, by copy hereof, I ask that Gerald or his designee prepare an Operating=
=20
Agreement between HPL and Merl Vanek whereby Merl will be entitled to operat=
e=20
this well for purposes of his grazing lease at this facility.  HPL desires=20
that Merl operate this well at his sole cost and expense and maintain it in=20
good working order.  We can make the term of this Operating Agreement=20
coterminous with his grazing lease which is established under an October 1,=20
1998 Grazing Lease with an original term of one year from that date and=20
year-to-year thereafter unless sooner terminated by at least 90 days' advanc=
e=20
written notice prior to the end of the original term or any renewal term=20
thereafter by one party to the other.  Merl's address is 2634 Milroy Lane,=20
Houston, TX  77088 with a phone number of 281-444-8689 and a fax number of=20
281-587-4200.  I have already advised Merl of the effective ownership of thi=
s=20
well by HPL and he will be operating it accordingly as his need to do so is=20
urgent, so I request that this document be prepared as soon as possible in=20
consideration of HPL's liability.

Thanks to all for your help on this.
