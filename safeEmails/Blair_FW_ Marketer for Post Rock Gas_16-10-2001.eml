Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for P=
ost Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out=
 shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send the=
m their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I woul=
d like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to s=
ign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cle=
ared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, pleas=
e let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta
