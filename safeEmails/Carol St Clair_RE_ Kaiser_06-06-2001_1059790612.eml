There was some confusion still on my part as to what type of transaction you=
=20
were looking to do with Kaiser and with which entity.  Could you please send=
=20
me an e-mail with a description.  You may recall that we have an ISDA in=20
place between Kaiser and ENA as well as a Master Swap Agreement between=20
Kaiser and an affiliate of ENA for aluminum products.
