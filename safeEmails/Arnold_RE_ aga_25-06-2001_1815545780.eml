no, the opposite.  saying price drop hasnt brought us closer to equilibrium.=
  we absolutley cant continue this loss of demand, otherwise we end up at 3.=
2 and the industry doesnt want to /cant end up there.   thus you must pick u=
p at least some demand.  price must keep dropping .   price dropped $1.5 and=
 haven't gained any demand.  that's the scary thing.  how much does it have =
to drop before we do find it?

 prices....assuming demand returned to normal how do you think there economi=
c conditions will mitigate this. =20

        cost about 200,000-300,000=20

        our internal estimates were in the 102-106 range, so no.  i think pi=
ra overestimating the gas gen burn for the week.  problem is there is no rea=
l good burn for at least two weeks going forward.  we've dropped $1.5 in a c=
ouple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand.  that's a big problem
