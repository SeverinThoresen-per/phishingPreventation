I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take=
 the day off on Wednesday.  The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and =
we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.  So we hope to=
 be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic. =20

With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday,=
 November 26. =20

If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car dur=
ing my morning commute.  Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00=
 am and 8:30 am might work. =20

These are certainly trying times.  You have been in my thoughts, and you hav=
e my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind. =20
