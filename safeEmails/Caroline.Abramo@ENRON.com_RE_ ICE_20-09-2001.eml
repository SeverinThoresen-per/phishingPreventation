hi..

Noted that ICE is competition.. I am not interested in us supporting that pr=
oduct at all.. I am still pushing Campbell and others to use an alternate so=
lution that gives us the advantage of seeing flow first hand in a discrete w=
ay.

An ICE solution more foils my attempts to build liquidity for the crude desk=
 than gas. Currently ICE has a much better market share on crude and the add=
ition of program funds would further frustrate our efforts to ever build a f=
low business. =20

On the flip side, ICE will not solve Campbell's problems on gas (prob not on=
 crude either) because there is no certainty they will get a tight market.. =
the very reason they are still talking to us.. so I guess I am not worried.

I am just pissed that these "solutions" keep popping up that keep Campbell a=
nd others from making decisions NOW.  I still like the Deutsche solution and=
 am talking to them again next week.. should have some comment from Campbell=
 by then too..

I am still looking for a system that can also accommodate credit constraints=
 as well.. you know.. our lines are pretty full with all the banks who would=
 be able to give us more flow..Deutsche system could help this too.

will keep you informed..
c

on a side note.. have been trying still to educate EOL (Bob Shultz) on these=
 considerations.. they are still debating whether we should have a clearing =
arrangement with someone.. that won't get around the CFTC issue..=20

Hey:
1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hour=
s when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearran=
ged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be leg=
al on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged tra=
ding is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE'=
s volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to IC=
E in the current state. =20
2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance,=
 a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the=
 2 trades additive. =20

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support th=
eir system, unless absolutely necessary.

Hi..=20
I hope you are all ok.. I am sorry for any losses that may have touched your=
 friends and family..

I looked at the ICE/LCH announcements.

I have a few questions:
1. Will ICE be able to work as a deal entry system as well as mechanism to p=
ost markets?

My concern here is that under the Deutsche proposal we would be able to do a=
 deal with you over the phone and then post it to their system.. and no othe=
r market participant would be able to see that transaction.. it would then g=
o straight to the clearing.

Currently, I'd say that only 2% of the time ICE has a tighter market than EO=
L.. this because they do not have the liquidity (and likely will not).

There is not a high probability we would ever contribute to this liquidity o=
ver our own system (Enron online) so the ability to deal directly with you i=
n still imperative.=20

2. Can margin at LCH be netted across products?

Looking forward to speaking.
Thanks and Regards,
Caroline
