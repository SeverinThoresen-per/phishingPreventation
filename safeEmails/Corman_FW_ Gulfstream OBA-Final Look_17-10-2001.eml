I think Frazier did understand and was representing my view.  I'd rather tha=
t there were no tolerances in the OBA -- only the concept of reasonable bala=
nces.   With this point located in the makret area, it is quite possible tha=
t we'll be the ones with the swing (especially since we'll have flow control=
). =20

If you prefer a tolerance in  both the termination and tolerance paragraphs =
I guess that's fine -- since the only remedy in either case is termination o=
f the OBA.  The existing balance (even if over 100,000 cum) will be settled =
up under the OBA.=20

	Frazier did not seem to understand my changes in the tolerance sections (4c=
 and 4d). =20
	So, to clarify:

	On the tolerances, my concern was twofold -- that we only have the 100,000 =
dth limit in=20
	the "termination" paragraph (and not in the tolerance paragraph), and that =
it was not clear=20
	that, even if the cumulative daily imbalances totaled only 5% of the schedu=
led volumes for=20
	the month, the parties would work to keep it below an actual volume of 100,=
000 dth (or have=20
	a right to terminate the agreement if it were over that amount).
