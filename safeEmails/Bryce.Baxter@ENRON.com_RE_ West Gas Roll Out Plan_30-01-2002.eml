It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power =
separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date wou=
ld be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are n=
ot going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a s=
ummer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been p=
aid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can disc=
uss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim

Kim,=20

Are these physical or financial, or a combination.  Do you know the terminat=
ion dates?  If not, I will try to get them from the confirmations group. =20

Thanks

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the clos=
e out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including=
 the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list=
=2E =20

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself f=
or the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them m=
oney, we should know that before we walk in the door).=20



Pls review and let's discuss....=20
