Hi Zimin,

INFLATION:
I am also spending a lot of time looking at short-term auto-regressive model=
s=20
for PPI and long-term, more fundamentally-based models.  This work is=20
important because we have potentially a large positive P&L that may be=20
unlocked by moving to our new indicative UK PPI curves.  John Sherriff and=20
Trena are keen that any models I produce are vetted/approved in Houston, so =
I=20
will forward to Stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and=20
documented.

STORAGE:
Thanks for the current storage  model.  Due to the complexity of the=20
modelling issues involved, I would strongly support a visit by you to help m=
e=20
meet the needs of the London customers in this matter, and am happy to act a=
s=20
the anchor for information flow in the mean time.

Regards,

Anjam,

Thanks a lot.  After getting that book I will redo the US inflation model. =20
Our exposure
to CPI inflation risk is huge (think about how many contracts signed by EES)=
,=20
so the
US model is very important.

The storage model is going through aduit by Prof. D. Duffie. We are adding=20
features
to it.   I can send you the current version. Maybe it is worthwhile for me t=
o=20
go to London
to discuss with the users about the valuation.=20
