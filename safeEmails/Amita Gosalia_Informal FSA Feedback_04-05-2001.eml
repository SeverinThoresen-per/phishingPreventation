Hi Guys

The following matters were discussed with Gay Wisbey, Paul Richardson and Te=
d=20
Morris of the Markets & Exchanges Division of the FSA.

FSA's view is that as more and more trading activity is moving from=20
traditional exchanges to proprietary electronic platforms the distinction=20
between the two is becoming blurred.  Currently, FSA has regulatory oversigh=
t=20
over both exchanges and firms which conduct regulated activity via their own=
=20
electronic platforms but the regulatory regime applicable to each differs. =20
In the light of this FSA is considering implementation of a dedicated=20
regulatory regime for alternative trading platforms (ATSs) so that regardles=
s=20
of whether business is conducted via an exchange or an electronic platform,=20
FSA would be able to monitor price transparency, transaction transparency,=20
market depth and robustness of systems supporting the platform.  As far as=20
the current situation is concerned FSA mentioned that even before=20
implementation of a specific ATS regime they would like electronic platform=20
operators such as Enron to keep FSA informed of any squeezes in the market=20
which become apparent to our traders - this seemed to be related to=20
EnronOnline activity vs offline activity.  This is clearly not something we=20
do now for offline deals.

Regulation of the EnronOnline platform could result in:

a) monitoring of the platform and activity on it particularly in terms of=20
operational robustness with no additional regulation of products quoted on  =
=20
EnronOnline;
b) regulation of the trading of financial products (currently regulated=20
through EEFT arranging deals for ECTRIC) and physical products (currently  =20
unregulated).  This could result in an anomolous situation where Enron's=20
offline physical trading is unregulated while online physical trading is  =20
regulated.
c) increased concern as to the systemic risk which increased trading activit=
y=20
via EnronOnline poses and therefore greater attention being paid to the  =20
management of counterparty credit risk and capitalisation.

I suggest that we issue a guest user id to the FSA to enable them to monitor=
=20
prices on an ongoing basis.

FSA is releasing a discussion document re ATSs in late May.  Jonathan Marsh=20
is monitoring developments in this area and will liaise with Justin Boyd and=
=20
me as soon as the paper is published.  This should provide further insight=20
into their intentions.

Please let me know if you need any further information at this stage.

Regards

Amita
