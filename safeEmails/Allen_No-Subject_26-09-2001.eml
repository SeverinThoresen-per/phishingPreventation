Jeff,

In light of the puny VAR allotments attributed to the simulated trading part=
icipants, we have decided to graduate Matt Smith from the exercise.  Please =
advise Kimat Singla it will no longer be necessary to calculate a simulated =
book for Matt Smith.  Please use his COB 9/25/01 P&L as his official score f=
or this exercise and post his total on the High Score table under the initia=
ls MDS.

Thank you,

Phillip=20
