FYI - response after my call to Brian.  Agreement refers to employees of Enr=
on Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas=
 specifically.  Enron Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight =
because so much of the support for gas comes from Enron Networks.  Close dat=
e on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from tha=
t point.  --Sally=20

Sally - I asked Anne Koehler to give you a call - I think the non-solicit pe=
riod is for one year.  The tricky bit is that we can't prevent our employees=
 approaching AEP for  job ( or responding to AEP advertisements for a job).
