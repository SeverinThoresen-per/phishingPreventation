John, I was wondering if you could do me a small favor.  Carr futres
(understanding there circumstance) was stuck long 4 lots.  We dicided to
help them out and take them today.  So I had my Henry Hub trader sell out
Oct 1st.  Car said they found there problem.  I tried calling the trader
over there and it was a penny bid over were we sold it.  Could you say
something to your trader over there to see if you could let us out.
