Provided below are some bullets outlining today's events.  The fact that we =
can now translate the EDI file is a giant step forward in the testing proces=
s.  Jesse and Jeff has done an outstanding job of getting us to this next st=
ep today. =20

Let Utilicorp know we are committed to our delivery date of Wednesday.
For the Utilicorp file,  the biggest problem was the missing 40 records.  Th=
e 40 record contains the volume (quantity).  When the 40 record is missing, =
the translator stops processing the file so no file is sent to Utilicorp.  B=
y Friday afternoon,  the problem with the 40 record has been resolved for te=
sting.  =20
The trailer record is incorrectly being sent as a 40 record. Jeff will have =
David fix it from home and resend this weekend. =20
Now that the files are able to be translated.  I will review test files for =
any data issues and report results.
The HPL file sent to Texaco contains several occurrences of a "?" in the tub=
e inside diameter, tap type, and meter type fields.  When this situation occ=
urs, the meters' with the "?" are sent to an error directory.  The error dir=
ectory information is sent to the Measurement department to correct.  Once t=
he data is corrected, the meters will be resent.   I am trying to find someo=
ne to take ownership for HPL since Enron sold it. =20

Regards,

Tammy
