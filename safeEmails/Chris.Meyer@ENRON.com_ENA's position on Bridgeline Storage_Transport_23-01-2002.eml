Spoke w/ El Paso's pipeline group this p.m..  They are extremely interested =
in pursuing discussions.  I did not disclose contract specific details....ju=
st explained the benefits of owning a position on Bridgeline.  El Paso belie=
ves they already have authority to purchase transport/storage on other pipel=
ine assets through SONAT.  If they are correct, the time period to transact =
is significantly reduced. =20

Do we need to send a letter to Bridgeline to get authority to share contract=
 specific info??? In other words, give direction on how to pursue.
