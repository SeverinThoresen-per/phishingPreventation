Dear all,

I just got a call from Thomas who wants to cancel the interviews scheduled=20
for today - he told me that he would call me at the beginning of May (after=20
his holidays) to arrange them.  I did mention that there was a risk that the=
=20
position may be filled by then, but he seemed unperturbed by this.

Regards,

Anjam
