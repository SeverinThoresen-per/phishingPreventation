FYI - While I simply received an assessment from Jenny, there is obviously a=
 listing of equipment that exists.  Looks as if Paige Cox on Jenny's team wo=
uld be the person to get with on this.  --Sally

Sally,  it doesn't appear that the fax machines already in ECS will be suffi=
cient for your needs.  Let me know if you would like us to assist your group=
 in getting additional fax machines.  I have to believe that there are numer=
ous excess machines around here.   JR

Jenny --

There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asse=
t scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are conc=
entrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not acco=
mmodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.

My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with=
 them, and we have the numbers changed.
