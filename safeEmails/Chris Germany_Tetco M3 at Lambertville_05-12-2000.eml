Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3=
=20
(in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on=
=20
a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on=20
Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6. =20

The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle. =20
E Town
N Jersey
PSE&G
Con Ed
Lilco
Bug
Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco)
Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)

Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin=
=20
at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.

Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how=20
much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.
