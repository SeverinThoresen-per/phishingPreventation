Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI -=20
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas=20
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig=20
Group should be the new name. =20
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas=20
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the=
=20
web.=20

thanks,
brad
