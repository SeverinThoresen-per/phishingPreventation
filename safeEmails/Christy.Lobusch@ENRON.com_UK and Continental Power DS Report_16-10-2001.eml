Dear Stacey and Kristin-

I have attached the 2000 Doorstep report for UK and Continental Power.  Unfo=
rtunately, Gas, EGM and EIM are also co-mingled in this report.  I apologize=
=2E  I will bring to the planning meeting their responses and status of thes=
e findings (I unfortunately, cannot email these). =20

Stacey - FYI, I kinda discussed this with Kristin.  But RAC is no longer goi=
ng to play an active role in the doorstep process.  We are going to use thei=
r business expertise and concerns during the planning meeting, but other tha=
n that, they have agreed to be available on a "consulting" basis after that.=
=20

I am working with Paul Day (Andersen Sr. Mgr in London) and Paul Bromley (Lo=
ndon EAS) on either getting an Andersen deal tester for you all or just subs=
tituting Andersen's deal testing for ours.  Additionally, EAS has performed =
a Client Self Assessment (similar to a "what could wrong" or control analysi=
s form).  I am trying to get a copy of that prior to you all leaving for the=
 doorstep.

I hope to have more info by next week, but wanted to pass this along. Thanks=
,

Christy
