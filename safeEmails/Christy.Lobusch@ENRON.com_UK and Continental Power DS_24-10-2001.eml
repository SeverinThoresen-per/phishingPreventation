Stacey-

I know that I left you a voice mail on this, but just to keep Kristin in the=
 loop as well.

After our conversation this morning, I talked to Paul Bromley again.  He has=
 asked that you keep in the loop as to your interview schedule so that he ma=
y coordinate with his team and Andersen as to attending the interviews.

Again, thanks for doing this for us!  I know that you all are busy.  Thanks,

Christy
