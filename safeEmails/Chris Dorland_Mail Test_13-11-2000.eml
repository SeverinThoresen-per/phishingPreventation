Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I=20
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-compan=
y=20
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't=20
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird.=20

Thanx=20

Chris Dorland
