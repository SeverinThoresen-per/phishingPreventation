Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will=
=20
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will=20
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I=20
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed note=
s=20
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be=20
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning.=20

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes.=20

All the best with being a mum again!


     Mark

Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only=20
reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point=20
in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary,=
=20
I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.
Carol
