I talked with John Buchanan and we decided not to do the pop up notice for t=
he new scheduled quantities report because we reserved that means of communi=
cation for instant critical notices.  So, we are going to send an email noti=
ce to all users using the email distribution list that we have for critical =
notices.  This email list should cover all active users whether they are onl=
ine users or EDI users.  Also, I can put more info in an email notice. =20
