Since you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from Dave on what he =
is looking for.  Since Dave referenced ENW, I assume that we will include ro=
les with regard to IT development projects.  Do you think that he also wants=
 to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?  --Sally=20

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and=
 a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid =
office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and res=
ponsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detai=
l.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could hav=
e this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Delainey
