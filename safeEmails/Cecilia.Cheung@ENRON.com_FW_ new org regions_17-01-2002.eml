I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check wit=
h John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options=
 books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that=
 can you please call Errol McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I d=
on't know how they need to be set up.

Thanks

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book =
is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, U=
nleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities=
 could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 bo=
ok set up for each of these 3 commodities).
