Larry:


HE 13 EDT - Original deal made for 50 MW @ $82.20 - Hourly P&L notes deal wa=
s cut at 12:15 and therefore only 13 MW flowed as confirmed by PJM data - Ta=
g review indicates flow started at 12:15 and ended at HE 13  (38 MW flow) - =
Settlements is requesting this be revised back to 50MW @ $60/MW - I need inp=
ut from you regarding this deal to determine the action required.  Please pr=
ovide any helpful info you have as soon as possible.

HE 10 EDT - Just an FYI that the purchase price was changed to $41/MW from $=
42 at the request of Exelon to our Settlements group.  I went ahead and chan=
ged it due to the low value and because it is in our favor.  If you disagree=
 with this or have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marci
