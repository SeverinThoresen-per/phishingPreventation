Bilbray's Power Fight
Emily Pierce, CQ Staff=20
California's deregulated electricity> market has been a disaster for many=20
consumers but may be a godsend for Republican Rep. Brian P. Bilbray.
The three-term lawmaker is tied in polls with Democratic state Assemblywoman=

Susan Davis, who has outpaced him in fundraising. In 1996, however, she vote=
d=20
for legislation that opened the state's <electricity> market to competition.=

The act was supposed to reduce prices and increase choice. Instead, the powe=
r=20
bills of San Diego residents have doubled since last year.
Bilbray has seized on the resulting unrest, introducing legislation to let=20
power companies buy some <electricity at cheaper rates. He will host a House=

Commerce Energy and Power Subcommittee field hearing on the issue Sept. 11 i=

San Diego.
Davis sponsored legislation in the state assembly to reinstate price caps in=

appears that this legislation was given to my opponent to help her in the=20
November election."
Davis campaign manager Lisa Sherman said Bilbray is improperly using the=20
issue, since he signed a 1996 letter supporting deregulation. But of the=20
field hearing she said, "We wouldn't oppose getting national attention on=20
this."
