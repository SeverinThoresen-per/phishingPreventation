Damnit Jeff.  What is the sleeping situation in the second cabin.  I don't
have time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The panic is my waste of time trying to get things organized.  That's the
panic.  I also don't want to tell people there are beds for them if there
are not.  Could you just right a simple straightforward email with the
number of beds.  Was there a math error on that one also????

math error.  big sleeps 8. little sleeps.

can you explain the panic about sleeping arrangements, and could you fill
me in on what those arrangements are prior to sending the email out?

I don't see how you get the numbers.  Can you please explain.  I don't have
the time to do this right now and I have to get the email off to the people
about sleeping arrangements.  I get 8 in one house and 5 in the other.
Please answer ASAP.
