Hey guys,

in light of my quickly approaching 26th birthday I wanted to invite you all =
to dinner on tuesday October 2nd. I hope that nice company (and plenty of al=
cohol) will help me to forget about my age for at least one evening.

So, what do you say?=20

The place: Buca Di Beppo (Massimo can translate it for you), 5192 Buffalo Sp=
eedway. Map is attached. The place is really nice, not too expensive and a l=
ot of fun. I think we could reserve a private room.

Time: October 2nd  7:30PM.

Please let me know if you can make it so I would know the exact number of pe=
ople.

Hope to see y'all there.

Vlad.
