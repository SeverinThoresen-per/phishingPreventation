I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the=20
call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying t=
o=20
conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I=20
mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me=20
compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to=20
quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent=20
information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in=
=20
many extra hours to help us out on this project.

I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.

Regards,

Craig=20
