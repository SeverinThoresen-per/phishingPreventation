works to install a combined cycle station in the province of Buenos Aires,=20
Argentina, which will allow this firm to have a 1,500 MW installed thermal=20
generation capacity in Argentina. Alicura is located in the province of=20
Neuquen, Southern Argentina, and has a 1,000 MW generation capacity. In=20
Argentina, AES controls the hydropower generation stations of Cabra Corral,=20
El Tunal, Ullum and Quebrada and the thermal stations of Sarmiento, Dique an=
d=20
San Nicolas. It also owns the energy distribution firms Edes, Eden and=20
Edelap, in the province of Buenos Aires, Such investments allowed AES to=20
close 1999 with a US$ 530.4mn billing in Argentina. In alliance with PSEG=20
Global, AES is constructing a combined cycle station named AES Parana which=20
will demand US$ 448mn having a 826 MW installed capaci
ty. The firm has recently been adjudicated the construction of two hydropowe=

ARGENTINA: RESULTS OF GAS NATURAL BAN
Buenos Aires Economico, 23 Feb 2000, p. 3:-
 Argentina's gas distribution firm Gas Natural BAN closed 1999 with net=20
profits of US$ 45.6mn, 4.1% over the positive results it reported back in=20

expansion project, which allowed Gas Natural BAN to gain new clients. By=20
December 31, 1999, the firm had 1.187mn clients. It also expanded the sales=20

ARGENTINA: ALCOHOL FUEL COULD SAVE SUGAR SECTOR
La Gaceta (Argentina), 20 Feb 2000, p. 10:-
 The crisis-ridden Argentine sugar sector is looking to promotion of the use=
=20
of alcohol fuel as a solution to its problem of surplus production, which=20
reaches some 200,000 tons per year. Most sugar mills already have the=20
infrastructure to supply raw material to produce alcohol fuel, and the move=20
is seen as an alternative to crop replacement to reduce sugar production,=20
given that this would take at least five years to achieve. Supporters also=20
argue that high world oil prices imply that production of alcohol fuel would=
=20
offer price advantages, while the use of alcohol as a fuel additive could=20
replace the use of petrochemicals which are not renewable resources.=20
The North-western refinery Refinor has expressed interest in the use of=20
alcohol as a fuel additive in order to replace the use of MTBE, given that=20
alcohol has the additional advantage of being exempt from fuel taxes. Refino=
r=20
is testing a new proportion of 10% ethyl alcohol and 90% petrol for such a=20
mix.
At the same time, it is argued that the existing 17 distilleries which=20
produce 150mn litres of alcohol annually have the capacity to produce 600mn,=
=20
thus allowing them to increase their exports or meet much of the annual=20
domestic demand of 850mn litres which would result from the replacement of=20
MTBE.
The principal concern expressed over such a programme is that it could cause=
=20
Brazil to demand that Argentina eliminate the tariff barriers imposed on=20
subsidised sugar imports from that country.


ARGENTINA: FINDING WAYS TO LOWER GAS PUMP PRICES
El Cronista Comercial, 23 Feb 2000, p.4:-
 The Argentine government announced yesterday that it will introduce a 10=20
point voluntary plan aimed at increasing competition in gasoline prices. The=
=20
measures would at best have an effect in the medium or long term. Firstly,=20
the Energy Secretary will facilitate the import of gasoline for independent=20
importers. Service stations would also have to register their contracts with=
=20
gasoline suppliers in order to prevent taxation that would effect competitiv=
e=20
pricing. The government will try to ensure that Repsol sells off some of its=
=20
service stations at competitive conditions. Moreover, the Energy Secretary=20
will report comparative gasoline prices and determine whether there is=20
overcharging. The Secretary will keep a register of wholesale diesel prices=20
and will force service stations to clearly advertise their prices. The=20
government will further investigate competition practices by oil companies=20
and will step up efforts to eliminate black market fuel sales.
