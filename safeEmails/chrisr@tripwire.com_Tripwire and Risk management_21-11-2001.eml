Rick,

I am sure the merger is keeping you busy enough for two people.  Tripwire is
helping companies like yours manage their technology risk, keeping them in
revenue producing mode.  Who on your team would have some cycles to speak
with me for 3-5 min about a potential fit between our organizations?
