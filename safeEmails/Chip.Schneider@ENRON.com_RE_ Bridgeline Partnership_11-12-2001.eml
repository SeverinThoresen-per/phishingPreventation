Lets meet from 4:00 to 4:45 on the 5th floor of ECS.  As it stands now - we =
need to understand what happens under the agreements in the event that we pu=
ll LRCI into bankruptcy.

Case 1:  Do Nothing - Dow terminates lease and brine service agreement, trap=
s gas in storage, LRCI cannot complete Enron #1, LRCI pays penalty payments =
to Bridgeline for not making storage capacity available, LRCI defaults under=
 Contribution Agreement. =20

Case 2: LRCI in Bankruptcy - ?=20

We need to make a call.

Regards,
Brian

et a meeting together today.
Thanks,
Karen
