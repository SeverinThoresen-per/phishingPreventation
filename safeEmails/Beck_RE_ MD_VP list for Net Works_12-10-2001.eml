FYI below.

You mentioned today in the PRC meeting some numbers on VPs across Enron Corp=
=2E  I was surprised at the total number of VPs in the company that were not=
 commercial.

ENW has 14 VPs, 1 MD and 3 in the OTC for a total of 18 employees in ENW at =
or above VP across commercial, commercial support, specialized technical and=
 technical.

Of the 14 VPs, 5 are specialized technical, 2 are commercial and 7 are comme=
rcial support.

Although I have a large number of employees to look at in the coming months =
for both budget and PRC, I do not have very many at senior levels.

We will have an ENW PRC report as per your request from the meeting today by=
 next Wednesday.
