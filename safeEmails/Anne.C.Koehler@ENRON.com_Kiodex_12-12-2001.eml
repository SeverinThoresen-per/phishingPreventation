Raj Vaswani, the general counsel for Kiodex, called me to pass along two mes=
sages:

1.	If a new  joint venture is created to resurrect EnronOnline, Kiodex would=
 be interested in pursuing a business relationship with the new joint ventur=
e.  I told him that it was much too early to predict whether this would be o=
f interest to a new trading company, but I told him I would relay Kiodex's i=
nterest to you.=20

2.	Kiodex may be interested in repurchasing the shares in Kiodex currently o=
wned by Enron Net Works LLC.  He did not know what the price would be, but w=
anted to know if we would be interested.  Since Net Works is a filed company=
, we would probably have to get the bankruptcy court's approval to sell.   I=
 assume that if the price is right we are interested in pursuing this.  Let =
me know.

Thanks, Anne
