In the cover letter to Mike Gent to transmit our Enron SSO document, it woul=
d be good to flag to Mike that Enron will participate in any forum to discus=
s the formation of an SSO.  This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter E=
PSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NE=
RC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox w=
e will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to ke=
ep feet on both sides of the fence.

The strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keep=
ing competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted =
in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere ne=
ar finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB no=
w more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spin=
meister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and t=
he Hill. =20

My new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and i=
nclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation proc=
ess (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB=
's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th qu=
adrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout=
 its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight=
=2E
