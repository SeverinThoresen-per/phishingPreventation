Good point.  Is that also Bear Creek storage?  The tax bill specifically=20
states Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I also left a voicemail for our tax guy. =20
There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authorit=
y=20
comes up with their number.  I would like to see it but I bet it takes a=20
while to get the support.

I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.  We have some type of deal=
=20
with NOPSI.  Any other ideas on that?
