Subject:	Outbound TMS Messages

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the=
 ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during t=
hese periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each sc=
heduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing=
 a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these =
messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical noti=
ces generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are cal=
led "critical notices" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to =
react.  =20

I do think we need to know the following: =20

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail s=
ystems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail syste=
ms?   =20
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchang=
e flowing during virus interruptions? =20

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were=
 disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we s=
hould proceed.=20
