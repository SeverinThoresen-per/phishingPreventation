I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made =
a=20
mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  =
I=20
do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This=20
should only be a problem for May and June, I think.

Please pay the disputed amounts.
