Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integra=
tion Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back pl=
ans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Severa=
l plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub=20
+       Development             Jay Webb=20
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster=20
+       HR                      David Oxley=20
+       Cash Management Tom Myers=20
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett=20

The rest will be completed shortly.=20

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different=
 focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  p=
lans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each=
 of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of=
 the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a sugges=
ted outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Pleas=
e decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually=
