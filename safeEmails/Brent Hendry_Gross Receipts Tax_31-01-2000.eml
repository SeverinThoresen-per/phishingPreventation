This memo is an attempt to give you some background on the work legal has=20
done for Don in the last year and a half in trying to find legal ways to=20
avoid paying the gross receipts tax on our gas contracts.  The issue came up=
=20
in a staff meeting a couple of weeks ago and I wanted you to be aware of=20
where we are on this issue.=20

When I first arrived in BA, Don and I had some discussions trying to come up=
=20
with a game plan to avoid paying the gross receipts tax.   The first attempt=
=20
to avoid the tax resulted in a type of Broker/Agent agreement where we would=
=20
act as the broker for the enduser for gas only purposes and through an agenc=
y=20
arrangement place ourselves in-between the producer and the enduser and=20
transact on the endusers behalf so that the producer and enduser would not=20
know each other.  This format was developed with the help of outside counsel=
=20
and the tax group.  The commercial team lost interest in this approach when=20
the complexity of the arrangement made it difficult to sell to the producers=
=20
and endusers.  Additionally, it would only work for customers who had their=20
own transportation. =20

Some time later Fede and others in the commercial team came up with two othe=
r=20
suggestions that they felt Enron could use to avoid the gross receipts tax=20
problem. =20

The first example proposed for our review came from the telecommunications=20
sector.  This "tax avoidance" method is based on the fact that the local=20
telephone companies have the ability to bill for third parties and not=20
include such amounts for purposes of calculating its own tax liabilities. =20
For example, cellular phone fees of cellular phone companies are billed to=20
the enduser by its local phone company as a separate line item and are not=20
included in its gross receipts.  The commercial team suggested that Enron=20
could specify in our invoices that we are billing for the producers and=20
therefore not include the amounts invoiced in our gross receipts.  The=20
billing mechanism used by the local phone company is based on an agency=20
relationship where the enduser's phone company is collecting on behalf of =20
the cell phone company for separate services than those provided by the loca=
l=20
phone company.  This is not a "tax avoidance" scheme by the telephone=20
company.  Both the cell phone company and the local phone company are=20
required to count the amounts they receive for their services, however those=
=20
amounts are collected, as gross receipts for tax purposes.  It just so=20
happens that the cell phone company uses an agent, the local phone company,=20
to collect their funds.  We determined that this approach, as a "tax=20
avoidance" scheme, would not work for Enron since the enduser signed a=20
contract for the purchase of the gas with Enron, not the producer, making it=
=20
impossible for us to argue we are a collecting agent for the producer. =20

Once it was clear that the first example was not going to provide the help w=
e=20
were looking for, the commercial team proposed a "tax avoidance" scheme used=
=20
by one of the small gas marketers.  The crux of this scheme consists of two=20
provisions, one in each of the producer and enduser contracts that they feel=
=20
allows them to net their proceeds for gross receipts tax purposes.  The=20
marketer enters into contracts with endusers that specify that the enduser=20
may be billed by third parties for the gas they purchased from the marketer.=
 =20
The contract also provides that the enduser would be obligated to pay the=20
marketer the difference between what the third party billed and what would=20
have otherwise been billed by the marketer pursuant to the contract (the "Ne=
t=20
Amount").  The marketer also signs gas purchase contracts with producers wit=
h=20
provisions that allow the marketer to request that the producer invoice the=20
marketer's endusers directly, although the marketer would remain the legal=20
counterparty to the contract with the producer.  The marketer's logic appear=
s=20
to be that since they did not receive the invoiced amount directly they do=20
not have to pay gross receipts taxes on the amounts collected by the produce=
r=20
but would only have to pay on the Net Amount.  This is the scheme that Gaby=20
mentioned two weeks ago in the staff meeting. =20

We reviewed the documentation used by the marketer and reviewed the legal an=
d=20
tax issues with outside counsel and our tax advisors and came to the=20
conclusion that the methodology used by this marketer is not legally=20
sufficient to avoid the tax liability.  Further, we were advised that if=20
Enron tried a similar strategy Enron and its management would likely incur=20
significant tax and legal liabilities.   The problem with the scheme is that=
=20
what the marketer is actually doing is an operational netting of purchases=20
and sales and not a legal netting for tax purposes.  Such operational nettin=
g=20
does not change the fact that legally the marketer is deemed to have receive=
d=20
the full gross amount from the enduser even if they did not physically=20
receive the invoiced amounts.  There are legal methods that could result in =
a=20
lower gross receipts tax but they require that the contract rights of the=20
marketer be assigned to the producer prior to the delivery of the gas.  The=20
marketer's documentation I reviewed was, while internally inconsistent and=20
vague, legally insufficient to actually result in an assignment of the=20
obligation to deliver gas to the producer which would have been the only way=
=20
to allow the marketer to avoid the gross receipts tax.  =20

This would normally be the end of arguments on tax schemes that don't work=20
but much is still made of the fact that YPF agrees to transact with marketer=
s=20
in this fashion and therefore the scheme must have merit.  The fact that YPF=
=20
agrees to invoice third parties adds nothing to bolster the merits of the=20
marketer's scheme.  There is no tax or legal liability assumed by YPF or any=
=20
other producer for agreeing to bill third parties so there is no risk for th=
e=20
producer to do so and no tax scheme endorsement can be argued.  In fact if I=
=20
was a big producer dealing with a small marketer with little or no tangible=20
assets I might agree to the same thing just because it would probably speed=20
up the process of getting paid for the gas I sold to the marketer.  As a=20
producer I would still be required to credit the amounts received from the=20
enduser as amounts deemed to be received from the marketer.  The important=20
point here is that whether the producer gets paid by the marketer or the=20
enduser its gross receipts tax obligation stays the same.  The producer is=20
not engaging in any tax avoidance scheme by billing third parties.  The=20
question is not whether the producer can accept payments from third parties=20
but rather whether the marketer can legally net the amounts it is owed by th=
e=20
enduser with the amounts the marketer owes to the producer by allowing the=20
producer to invoice directly.  The tax law is clearly based on gross receipt=
s=20
not net receipts and our counsel and tax advisors tell us that this scheme=20
does not result in the marketer being able to legally declare its net=20
receipts as its gross receipts. =20

Once it became clear to Don that this marketer's method of trying to avoid=20
the turnover tax did not really work he asked me to try and develop another=20
broker agreement format, this time for both producers and endusers that woul=
d=20
mimic the legal and commercial risks of marketing.  He wanted a set of=20
documents that would allow Enron to be paid a fee equal to the difference=20
between what the producer charges and what we would have charged the=20
enduser.  He also wanted to keep the producers and endusers from knowing who=
=20
the other party to the transactions were and wanted Enron, as broker, to=20
assume all the same risks of non-performance that would have existed if we=20
remained the marketer in the middle.  I worked on a document that ended up=20
being more complex structurally than the first broker agreement and more=20
complex legally because of the parameters requested by Don.  I worked with=20
outside counsel to review the structure but they ultimately advised us that=20
the structure, as outlined, would not likely withstand a challenge by any ta=
x=20
court since the difference between what we wanted and a marketing agreement=20
was simply a matter of form over substance.  Any taxing authority would have=
=20
deemed our duel broker arrangement to be in reality contracts for the=20
purchase and sale of gas because all the risks associated with marketing wer=
e=20
being assumed by Enron.  As we could not come up with a workable alternative=
=20
that would be commercially acceptable to all parties we stopped working on=20
the document several months ago.  Additionally, it became apparent that the=20
document was so complex as to be virtually unmarketable to either the=20
producers or the endusers.   =20

I left the issue on my "to do" list for several months to see if I could com=
e=20
up with another alternative which I have not been able to do.  I cannot=20
envision another structure that would allow us to retain our desired risk=20
profile and not have to pay a gross receipts tax.  We could change our=20
business to straight brokering but that alternative has never been considere=
d=20
commercially acceptable to Enron.  The only other obvious choice is to work=20
on lobbying to get the tax laws changed in such a way as to put marketers on=
=20
a level playing field with producers.

Please let me know if you want to discuss this further or if you have other=20
suggestions for me to look at.
