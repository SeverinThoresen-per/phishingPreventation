Gloria,
The reason you don't see the contracts on the SG assignment screen or the CP=
=20
name on the SG maintenance screen is because the contracts originally rep'd=20
over to Unify with Amreican Refining And Exploration as the provider. Global=
=20
Contracts can help you with touching and re-releasing the contracts. Then tr=
y=20
it again and call me if you have questions.  Trang x36996
