Louise,

I had a brief chat with Mark regarding his plans for Enron Wholesale Tech Se=
rvices.  As I understand him, he sees the ENA Tech Services group reporting =
into Brian Stanley on a dotted line basis in order to keep these groups coor=
dinated.=20

You may want to first discuss/sell this reporting relationship with the orig=
ination units who will fear another EE&CC.  Further, we will have to sell th=
is organizational structure to the members of the ENA Tech Services Group.  =
I'm concerned that we may loose some of our top engineers who will resist be=
ing organizationally tied to EAS.=20

Two possible alternative arrangements:

1.	The ENA Tech Services group remains as ENA's development engineering orga=
nization.  It should be regionalized and report (on a solid line) to the ori=
gination groups.  This will keep the ENA Tech Services group lean and mean a=
nd somewhat independent from the Wholesale Tech Services Group:

	a)	Bob Virgo/Mike Coleman would report into Presto/Durhan,
	b)	Wayne Mayes and his team would report into Calger. =20
	c)	Mike Coleman would report into Max and would help support ESA,
	d)	Nick Cocavessis would support the gas and liquids businesses
	e)	Ron Blackham would support Enron South America

Brian Stanley's group would be seen as a technical resource base to draw fro=
m, and as a "friendly" check on the technical assumptions that are used in t=
he pro formas.  Brian Stanley's group would provide a review of Enron Americ=
a's DASH's so as to keep the ENA Tech Services group from becoming too aggre=
ssive in its assumptions (whereas Brian's group will tend to be over-conserv=
ative in its role as risk manager). =20

2.	Another alternative is to create a broader role for the commercial invest=
ment/asset management group that you, Dick and I spoke about.  This unit wou=
ld combine the skill sets of the Restructuring Group and the Tech Services G=
roup.  It would have the technical responsibility for ENA transactions throu=
ghout their life cycle and would have commercial responsibility for investme=
nts and assets that no longer have strategic or ongoing financial value to t=
he origination groups.  Specifically:

	a)	investments and assets that were not projected to earn their cost of cap=
ital
	b)	investments and assets that had little or no strategic value
	c)	troubled assets/positions/investment that required significant time/atte=
ntion beyond what the origination groups were willing to spend

As with suggestion (1.) above, this group would use Brian Stanley's organiza=
tion as a resource base to draw from on an as needed basis, however, there w=
ould not be a formal reporting relationship.

Lets discuss,
Brian
