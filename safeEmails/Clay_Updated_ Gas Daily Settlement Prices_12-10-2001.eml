I am Monica Clay, a new Business Analyst in the Gas Tactical group.  One of =
my first tasks has been to cut down on IT handling of data.

We have gone over the process for getting data into the ERMS database and th=
ere have been times that IT has move data around after changes or inserts ha=
ve beeen made.  To prevent this we would like to introduce an addition to th=
e process to keep all data in the Business Unit's hands.  We would like your=
 input on the small change to the process and the pub_postings screen that i=
s used often by many.

Please contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you in advance,

Monica
