Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed aftern=
oon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a h=
unting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - bot=
h keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All=
 I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I =
could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing=
 boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my =
BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She=
 stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Thin=
gs went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my=
 girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed=
=2E

Later Gator.
