I realize this is short notice, but I would really like for you all to atten=
d=20
this meeting from 2:30 to 4:00 or 4:30 pm tomorrow at Bridgeline's offices. =
=20
Their people are trying to get up to speed on the systems and the business. =
=20
Most are accountants from Texaco, and there is a common theme - they think i=
n=20
accounting deadlines, after the end of the month, and most do not have=20
experience with a trading business.  I assume they have experience with the=20
asset world.  I am sure they are very capable employees, but they have so=20
much on their plates, and we can help.  I realize that we lost some time=20
today with the system outage as well as it is the end of the month.  However=
,=20
we will never migrate our services to their infrastructure if we don't get=20
this moving.  So I would like to do a "chalk talk" tomorrow with them - very=
=20
simply, starting at ground zero.  We need to explain Sitara, CPR, TAGG and=20
ERMS as well as Unify and POPS.  The perspectives need to be very clear=20
also:  Marketing, Onsystem Pipeline and Offsystem business.

I know that Mike, Daren and Rita (I think) will be there.  Tommy Yanowski=20
will be there also.  If possible, I would like Mary, Pat and Lisa to join us=
=20
also.  Steve, we will not do an in-depth discussion of Risk as Jay came from=
=20
ENA, and they are not a mark-to-market company.   We will cover this more=20
from an accrual basis.  So I don't think your time would be best utilized,=20
but you are more than welcome if you want to attend.  Mary, I think your=20
background and system knowledge will be beneficial even though you have not=20
been involved in the Bridgeline transactions.  Pat, it would be helpful for=20
you to be there to provide any insight you might have, but I know it will be=
=20
tough for both you and Daren to be gone.  Exercise your judgement.

Please let me know ASAP if you can swing being there.  I know it is=20
difficult, and the room will be tight, but I appreciate any support you all=20
can provide.  I will be in and out myself.  Thanks in advance for your help.

We have made a small change in the timing of tomorrow's meeting.  We are now=
=20
planning on having the regularly scheduled Glen Ceditol meeting from 1:00 -=20
2:30.  We will be going over several of the issues that were raised in last=20
weeks meeting (i.e., operational zones and gas control reports from the=20
Texaco system) as well as discussing various items on a go forward basis.  W=
e=20
then, albeit somewhat backwards, will have Brenda and some people from her=20
shop give an overview of the scheduling systems from 2:30 to 4:00.  Please=20
make every effort to make the meeting at those times.

Thanks

Trevor
