FYI. The attached link provides a map of all U.S. gas pipelines combined wit=

Note that you can 'zoom in' for a detailed view of specific zone or region.
The map could be very helpful with our origination efforts and the content, =
information and functionality of the map provides unique insight into the pi=
peline system. =20
Keith Fraley and his group manage other map centered content including power=
 generation, proposed power generation, proposed new pipelines, proposed ext=
ensions of pipelines, gas storage facilities, weather, ect. They were helpfu=
