Adele,
I reviewed the opinion and there were several changes to the form from the p=
rior draft.  I would like to discuss two of the additions with your counsel =
if that would be ok with you.  The first addition at issue is subpart k at t=
he end of the first paragraph on page two.  It looks like we may need a repr=
esentation from you that you are not and will not carry on investment busine=
ss in or from within Bermuda and that you will not perform your obligations =
under the Agreement in or from within Bermuda in order for the opinion to ha=
ve value.  The second addition at issue is subpart (e) under section 8 of th=
e opinion.  As written it looks like a large loop hole that can be taken adv=
antage of just by finding evidence that was not submitted at the trial.  Our=
 General Counsel is concerned with what looks like an easy way to circumvent=
 a foreign judgment.  I would appreciate your thoughts or any clarification =
I can get. =20

Regards,
Brent Hendry
