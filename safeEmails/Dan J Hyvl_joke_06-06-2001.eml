passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said=

"Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and=20
crew take you safely to your destination."?

Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the=20
captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants=20
came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the=20
captain a woman?"

"Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."

"My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what=

to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."

"That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the=20
cockpit."
