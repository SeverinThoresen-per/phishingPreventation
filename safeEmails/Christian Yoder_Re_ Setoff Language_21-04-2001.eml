Your clause is not as finely tuned as it could be, but it is difficult to=20
give you exactly the precise wording to make it more finely tuned because it=
=20
exists in a context of a number of related provisions in the Master=20
Agreement.  Here is how I would ultimately like to see the clause work:

After calculation of a Termination Payment in accordance with Section ___, i=
f=20
the Defaulting Party would be owed the Termination Payment, the=20
Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion,=
=20
to (i) set off against such Termination Payment any amounts due and owing by=
=20
the Defaulting Party or any of its Affiliates to the Non-Defaulting Party or=
=20
any of its Affiliates under any other natural gas, energy or other commodity=
=20
or financial agreements, instruments or undertakings  between the Defaulting=
=20
Party or any of its Affiliates and the Non-Defaulting Party or any of its=20
Affiliates and/or (ii) to the extent the Transactions are not yet liquidated=
=20
in accordance with Section ___, withhold payment of the Termination Payment=20
to the Defaulting Party.  =20

If you could get whoever is helping you with your deal to work these concept=
s=20
into the gas agreement you would be much better protected by the clause than=
=20
you are with the one you just sent me. ---cgy

this Agreement or otherwise).
