No.  No.  No.  We do not want to tell MSN until after they are formally serv=
ed.  To bolster our venue argument, we want to make sure they don't have cha=
nce to file a lawsuit before they are served. We can call them literally one=
 minute after formal service has been accomplished.

We need to call them and tell them we did it.  Who should do that?

	The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN for=
mally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working wi=
th the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN=
's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possi=
ble  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit=
 to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

	Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know i=
f any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delay=
ed.

	I will keep you updated.

	Andy
