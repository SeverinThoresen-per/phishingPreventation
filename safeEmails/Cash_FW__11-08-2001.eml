I will alert him that you will be sending him something.  He is the managing
shareholder of that office and he either will do it or assign it to one of
his partners.

Thanks for thinking of us.  Any word on the Mariner Energy people?

Kerry,

We have a need to have a proposal/concept reviewed by Colorado lawyers.
Which lawyer at your firm should we contact?

Thanks.

Michelle
