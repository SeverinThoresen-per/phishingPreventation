Hello Mr. Derrick:

It was a pleasure talking to you yesterday about our yoga classes, it was ve=
ry interesting hearing your opinion about the Power Yoga!

I also mentioned to you that I am running a marathon in Hawaii on December 9=
=2E  I am running on behalf of Sarah, a cute 10 year old girl that has arthr=
itis since she was 18 months old and she hasn't been able to be a normal kid=
=2E  If you don't mind I would like to ask you if you will be so kind to spo=
nsor me with a small donation to this worthy organization.  I actually, comm=
itted to collect $3,800 for them to be able to run de marathon and I was doi=
ng so great that I almost had it made, but today when we received the email =
about no more matching donations put me a little bit behind.=20

Please let me know and I could send Joey to pick up the donation.  If not, p=
lease don't feel bad, I understand we are going through very hard times late=
ly.

Thank you so much, Mr. Derrick and I will be seeing you at the yoga class if=
 you can make it on Saturday.
