Rob:
In case we don't get a chance to talk, just some thoughts on chnages that ma=
t=20
need to be made to the ISDA Schedule:

1. Part 1 (b) - this is where we will specify the Threshold Amount for cross=
=20
default to other debt (Section 5(a)(vi) purposes.  Please note that the=20
definition of Specified Indebtedness in the ISDA is very narrow.  Let Mark=20
Taylor know if that needs to be amended.  Alos, let Mark know if the cross=20
default language itself needs to be amended to match the Supply Agreement.

2. Part 1 (h) - this section contemplates adding Additional Termination=20
Events.  I had thought that here we would add a cross default to the=20
Transaction Documents.  Mark will need input from you on what those are. =20
Additionally, it would be here that we would add some of the other trigger=20
events that are currently in the Supply Agreement.  Again, Mark will need=20
your input on what those are.

3. Please look at the language in sections 5(a)(vii)(bankruptcy) and=20
5(b)(iv)(credit event upon merger) of the ISDA form and advise Mark as to=20
whether any changes need to be made to conform with what is in the Supply=20
Agreement.

I'm assuming that the other parts of the schedule will be agreed to by them.=
 =20
Please note that in Part 1(e) we have chosen the "Loss" method as a means fo=
r=20
calculating the termination payment.  In Part 3, these are the docs that we=20
usually get but if the Supply Agreement requires something different,=20
particularly with respect to financial info, we can modify accordingly.    I=
n=20
part 4, we have chosen arbitration and Texas as governing law.  Part 5 is=20
mostly boilerplate, but note the "setoff" language and the "transfer"=20
language, which they may comment on.  part 6 is boilerplate.=20

Mark's number is 853-7459.  I'll be back Wednesday afternoon.
