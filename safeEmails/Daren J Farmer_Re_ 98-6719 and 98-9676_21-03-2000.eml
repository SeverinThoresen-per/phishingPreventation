Robert,

I've taken care of 98-6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation=20
exception screen).  I'm going to place 98-9676 on Strangers Gas until you=20
hear back from Daren or Julie.

Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back=
=20
w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie)=20
as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my=20
allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting=20
arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter.

It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that th=
e=20
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.

Thanks

all wellhead deals through Tom Acton first.

I've got a message into Julie Meyers to look into the contract at meter 9676=
,=20
and will let you know what she determines.

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meter=
s=20
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so=20

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the dea=
l=20
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the=20

     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is=20
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/200=
