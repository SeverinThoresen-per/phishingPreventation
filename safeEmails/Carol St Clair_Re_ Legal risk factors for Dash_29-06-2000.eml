1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the=20
effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much=
=20
as it is a relationship issue.

2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I=20
doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They=
=20
really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship t=
o=20
the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this mornin=

Carol:

Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable=
=20
Power Product for the Dash.  Please let me know if you think I should add or=
=20
revise anything:

1.  Section 8.3 indemnity obligation -- We are required to indemnify the=20
insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance=
=20
under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our=20
refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.  We hope=
=20
to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation=20
would be subject to tolling in an insolvency situation.

2.  The insurer is permitted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there=20
is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omission by ENA in obtaining=20
coverage.  (The current version of the policy also provides for revocation i=
f=20
the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap=20
counterparty.  However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance polic=
y=20
if possible.)  ENA is not limited to the group of employees administering th=
e=20
auction but rather includes the entire organization.  Therefore, we could pa=
y=20
out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had approved coverage and=20
face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny=20
coverage based on, e.g., a material omission by ENA in failing to provide=20
relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was=20
presented.  Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to ou=
r=20
counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.

3.  Credit risk -- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occurrence of an=20
Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in=20
the underlying swap.

4.  Loss adjustment credit risk -- If the price we use to pay a counterparty=
=20
under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we ma=
y=20
be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the=20
insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.  However, if the pric=
e=20
adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may=20
have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a=20
refund from our counterparty.

5.  Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breac=
h=20
of our duties under the policy.  For instance, if we fail to comply with the=
=20
notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.=
 =20
However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap. =20
