Kristin,

Have you seen any studies associated with the opinions that the $12B is not =
enough.  I would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short b=
y the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates. =20

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.=
  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with con=
fidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they hadn't =
already."  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that "they were=
 too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest equity hol=
ders were screaming not to do it."

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are "s=
peculative" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they th=
ought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankru=
ptcy court."

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power f=
or the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only =
reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the =
market could handle."  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average pe=
ak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference=
 between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kat=
hleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authoriz=
ed by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop until we [C=
alifornia] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides e=
xpects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer."
