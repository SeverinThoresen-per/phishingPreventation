Group,

Just a quick reminder of the process to pay back losses on our John Day to=20
COB transmission.  As you know we route the schedules through deal number=20
146517.  At the end of the day, we need to aggregate the costs for losses on=
=20
the transmission that is flowed and make an annuity to ST-NW.  The annuity=20
should be a purchase from ST-NW by Short Term West Hourly for 1 mw at the=20
total cost for the losses for that day.  Then put the annuity number in the=20
inc sheet.  Please try to standardize your annuity transactions going=20
forward. =20
Thanks
Bill
