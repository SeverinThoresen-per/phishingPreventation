Anthony:  It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for =
ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from Rob.  Although we have =
missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to Dan L=
eff and Wade Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow t=
hrough on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings th=
at we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get o=
ne of these packages finished.  =20

Jenny:  Can Ken get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of thi=
s tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, Beth Ap=
ollo,  and Anthony by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised =
packet by afternoon - to Thursday.  Thanks. =20
