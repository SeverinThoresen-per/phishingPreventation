Chris,

I just got done reviewing some of the data in the October SMS invoice for IE=
S and I can see some major problems.  It looks to me like about 1/2 of the g=
ates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caus=
ed us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in =
both Zone BC and Zone D.

It was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactl=
y the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only =
varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the wa=
rm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the l=
oad on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(287=
0), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2=
880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.

I need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I=
 waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated an=
d if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing tha=
t makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing dat=
a which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even v=
ery good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bil=
l us for DDVC's.

=46rom now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the est=
imated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for.

Thanks,
Jeff
