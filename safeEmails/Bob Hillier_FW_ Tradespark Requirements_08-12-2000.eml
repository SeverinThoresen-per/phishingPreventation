Andy, do we have any intention of doing any integration with Tradespark at=20
this time?  If we do I will get more involved in this otherwise we will just=
=20
let the infrastructure team continue to run with this.

Let me know,
bbh

I need to have another discussion about this with you . . . we need an=20
application group to work on this, because there is quite a bit of=20
application analysis that needs to be done.

I found out that from an infrastructure perspective, this is much more than=20
just a remote connection.  It involves an application implemented in our=20
environment, and applications deployed to the desktop.  Is this something th=
e=20
e-commerce team needs to be involved in (I don't think it is), but probably=20
more like Beth Perlman's team.

Bob.

Correction to previous e-mail:
 The equipment we would send to Enron would comprise of 2 Cisco 2600
Routers (1 for each circuit), 2 Cisco Hubs, 2 Sun Ultra 5s with 2 NIC cards
each. Each Sun would connect to its own hub and router for redundancy and
load balancing purposes.
Sorry for the confusion.

Marcello

> for us, one for your network. The Sun Ultra 5 does not come with a monitor

>  Once the equipment is installed and tested we can begin the process
> of connecting from your network. All we need from Enron is a network IP
