Tell them that margin will be posted as normal, no excess nor any intraday c=
alls.  Since ENE is flush with liquidity, he should be very comfortable that=
 we can pay our bills.  The positions will roll off through time until the p=
osition gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and clo=
se the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and Enron i=
n energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures. =20

John - I returned a call to Ira Polk and Kevin Davis today at Man.  Ira was =
not in so I spoke with Kevin. =20

Kevin asked me if Enron would consider posting more margin than required by =
NYMEX on our option positions. He said that "given ENE is now flush with liq=
uidity" he thinks it would make Enron "look good" in front of the EDF Board.=
  He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would b=
e "ecstatic" with 1.5x (about $5 million.)  He specifically asked me not to =
elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what =
EDF is asking of ENE.  He also told me that if we did not post the additiona=
l margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market=
 moved against our positions.  Kevin also state that EDF is too small compar=
ed to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deal=
s and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank. =20

I have been out of town so may be missing on part of the story but I think i=
t's ridiculous that EDF wants us to do them a favour when they ditched us wh=
en Enron was in a  severe liquidity crisis.  I told Kevin that I did not thi=
nk we would meet his request but that would check on it internally. =20

I talked to Man and they agreed to back off.  They will not call for more ma=
rgin nor will they require us to move positions, as of this minute anyway.  =
If you hear any differently, please call me.
John
