Mtr 1534 - I created deal 238899 for 3/2-31/00 and #238900 for Apr.

Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal. =20

98-1534 is on the 215K for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in Sitara,=20
on deal #163005.  Can you see if it is o.k. to extend the deal for the rest=20
of the month?  It has flow every day after the 1st.

98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and=20
covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to exten=
d=20

Thanks
