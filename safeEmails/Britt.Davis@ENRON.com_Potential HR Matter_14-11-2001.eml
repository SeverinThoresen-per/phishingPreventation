	Todd Menzing called me up a few days ago to ask if he could send a letter t=
o me about what I understand to be his representation of a former Enron empl=
oyee against us in an HR matter.  I hadn't heard from him, so I followed up =
today and learned that he had or was going to send a letter to you.

	Menzing is a former V&E associate.  He called me because he knew me from a =
case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter=
, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter.

	Maybe there is an easy, no-brainer answer to what appears to be a potential=
 disqualification issue for both Menzing and his firm (remember the mad cow =
disease of legal ethics? ) but if you were not already aware of Menzing's pr=
ior employer, I thought I'd let you know.

	Britt
