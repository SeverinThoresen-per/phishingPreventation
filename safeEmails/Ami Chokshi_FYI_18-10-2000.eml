Just wanted to let you know that any Entex information that I have put=20
together is in the following directory.
 o/logistics/entex...(mostly in the reference tab)

Also, most all of the historical volumes can be found in the risk folder:
 o/erms/1intra/texas/entex/databases

Let me know if you think of anything else that you need.=20
