after thinking about the schedule from Barry, I think that the following sch=
edule is the one that should be completed.  I believe that this schedule wil=
l provide more information about what items may be more recoverable than oth=
ers.  Also it will help ask questions as to what we really believe on recove=
ry values. If you have any questions, please call.

Also who has information on ECTRIC?

Kent

Attached is a soft copy of the sheet we discussed earlier.

After chatting with Jim, I've removed EES and additionally added Canada.
