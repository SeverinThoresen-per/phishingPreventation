Greg,

Prior to doing the one-year trade with Powerex I forwarded the traders over=20

The traders got the following feedback from their legal / contracts people.=20
Their main concern is the language in section VII.

Let me know if you have any comments and what changes (if any) we should mak=

Thanks
