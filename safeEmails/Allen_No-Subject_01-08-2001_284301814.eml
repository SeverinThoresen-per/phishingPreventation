Jean,

Congratulations on being team leader for the video. =20

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that =
is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It co=
uld start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be pu=
t out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his sh=
irt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow to=
day.

Phillip
