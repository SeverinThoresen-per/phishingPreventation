Mark and Frank, in addition to the emails I sent to Frank about Devon and ma=
rk about PPL, here is a summary of the where we stand on some of the hot ISD=
A negotiations and what, if anything, needs to be done right away.

PPL Energy-- the schedule was negotiated.  Darren V. in credit and I were wo=
rking to correct some errors and issues re: the guaranty.  Darren can discus=
s.  This is the ISDa that is ready to move and should move.  Mark, I think I=
 forwarded to you the lastest emails from this week from Darren.  But in any=
 case, if another lawyer can check this file and call Darren if they have an=
y questions, he would be quick to get back to that persona and get them up t=
o speed.

Devon - Frank and I spoke about Devon today.  The counterparty had put the f=
ile on file because Devon was too busy focusing on the acquisition of Mitche=
ll Energy (the company built by the guy who also built the Woodlands).  Now,=
 Devon is ready to move forward and requested a blackline.  Jason has asked =
that we hold off until he can review credit issues in light of the acquisiti=
on.

Welch's -- Jason Williams and I have worked on this one very closely and Jas=
on has attended every conference call with me.  We have gone back and fault =
on the thresholds and Jason sent some new ones, I faxed them to the counterp=
arty and we have not heard back from them.  I emailed Jason today to ask him=
 to please follow-ip to ask about the thresholds. Otherwise, we have updated=
 blacklines in the file.  I have asked several swap attorneys about question=
s before I moved forward but Sara has been the second point person.  Check w=
ith Jason to see if the attorney follows up -- she might be on vacation.  Ke=
egan also has the phone number of the attorney's assistant who knows how to =
reach her when she is out of the office on a part time (or summer) schedule)=
