EPMI recently did a deal with the City of Vernon which was a little bit funk=
y=20
and the sensitive, high strung city got somewhat out of sorts about the way=20
we insisted upon documenting the deal and bitched to our trader (Rosman)=20
about it, who, in turn, having a bad karma day, as usual, came in and bitche=
d=20
to me about it.  After some hearty belly-laughing at his expense flowing fro=
m=20
the rich comedic theme of how we talk so sweet to our customers on the phone=
=20
and then hang up and curse their mortal souls with expletives deleted,    I =
=20
agreed with him that we need to ask the following question to those above=20
with more wisdom than we have:

When you do the physical leg of an EFP transaction,  must the delivery point=
=20
for the physical piece be identical to the delivery point of the futures=20
piece? =20

Shooting from the hip on the Casino floor without much substantive=20
explanation to go on, I said the answer to this question was absolutely yes=20
and the City of Vernon huffed and puffed and said they had done other deals=20
where the delivery points were different.

I made us document the deal as follows:

1. An undocumented Nymex transaction whereby our broker agreed with their=20
broker that we would buy 30 Palo Verde futures contracts from Vernon for $12=
0.

2. Then, the Exchange of this futures position for a physical position was=20
documented as a physical trade whereby EPMI sold Vernon 30 MW at Palo Verde=20
for $120.

3. Then, because Vernon wanted to get out of their Palo Verde position, we=20
agreed to buy back the 30 Mw for $120 and this was documented as a phsical=20
transaction.

4.  Then, because Vernon needed the power at NP-15, we sold them 30 MW at=20
NP-15 for $116. (Don't get distracted by thinking about buying at $120 and=20
selling at $116 and losing money. The prices were good at both points as par=
t=20
of our portfolio of deals.) =20

Vernon said we should have done step 1 and step 4 and not 2 and 3 and that=20
they do this all the time.  I basically said that if the delivery point in=20
the NYMEX contract was PV that it had to be the same in the physical part of=
=20
the EFP.   May we please have the benefit of any comments on this issue. =20
Thank you kindly.----cgy
