Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today...

Simple thoughts.....

=20

US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold.....

=20

It's not the other way around.

=20

The world is losing confidence.  Everyday we get more terrorist activity aro=
und

the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....)

=20

 Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world wa=
nt

their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in =
the

States, sell the USD and buy their home currency.

=20

US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part

that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods

only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month....

=20

And where are we importing from.....

=20

China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product

sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China......

compliments from Mark....  China has a competitive advantage, and trade rule=
s

will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure

adjusts...... say in 25 years......

=20

Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe m=
ust

be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... grow=
th

in many industries in Europe is from the US. How can anybody in Brussels thi=
nk

that a trade surplus with the US almost equal to China's (and one that is

larger than Japan's...) is a proper economic condition.......   As I said on

Tuesday.... I believe that the purchasing power parity level for the EUR is =
up

over $1.0800. (this is based on some long term thoughts.... that the old DEM

for PPP was 1.80 against the USD....)

=20

The EUR is undervalued by 12.5%. That's why I think it's funny that European

politicians and the press feel that the EUR is strong up here the .9500 - .9=
600

area.

=20

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade

picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyon=
e

saying they want a strong USD.......

=20

The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has =
to

attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either

asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is

happening.....

=20

Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the

deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......

=20

So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done

into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no

retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

=20

Until we get a screaming need to own US equities..... there appears to be no

need to own USD, and no retracement of the EUR.

=20

Japan's trade surplus with the US..... $6.8 bln.  The game continues.....

USD/YEN 123.50 and no Bank of Japan...... I think, it would not be in the be=
st

interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of=
 a

trade deficit.

=20

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......

Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade

surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......

=20

But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln U=
SD

just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in tr=
ade

creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......  Who knows, maybe  a few voices in

Asia could clamor....  that the YEN is too weak.....

=20

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbi=
ng,

(I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will

someday dollarize........

=20

Canada's trade surplus with the world is up 11.0% to $5.2 bln. Automotive

exports... the key.  The CAD trade surplus with the US was $8.2 bln and a

deficit with the rest of the world at $3.0 bln. (The US commerce department =
has

the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)

=20

SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October. It's moving on it's own,=
 no

sympathy move with the YEN.... so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the

YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia....

=20

Thai baht is also firm at 42.00 against the USD.  Korean won still at 1210.

Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit.

=20

Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD, since May 1 the VEB has

devalued 52%.   Not much more to say.....

=20

Everyone have a great day....... the above thoughts are for your reading

pleasure. Any questions call me. All the best.
