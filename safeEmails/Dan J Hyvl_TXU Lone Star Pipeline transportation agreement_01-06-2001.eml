As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you=
=20
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement=20
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel=20
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in th=
e=20
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is=20
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out=20
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replac=
e=20
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call=
=20
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.
