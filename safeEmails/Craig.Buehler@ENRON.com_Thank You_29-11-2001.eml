Hi Ken,

	I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you're trying to=
 do for us during this horrible situation.  It would have been easy to stay =
at home (many people would have) and watch events unfold but you had the gut=
s and the heart to come back and take this thing head on. Being a 21+ year E=
nron/NNG employee, this situation has been heartbreaking... I know you're th=
ere too.  Many employees are sitting around in a daze over everything we've =
lost; I've lost everything too, BUT there are SO many things I have in my li=
fe that I would never have achieved had it not been for you and your leaders=
hip.  I am eternally grateful for everything you've done for Enron and for m=
e personally. Hang in there, we still believe in you and this company.

God Bless You,

Craig Buehler
