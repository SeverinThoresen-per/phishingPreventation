Question:  We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch=20
storage for the 2000 tax year.  I found out yesterday that ENA handles=20
no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that.  Do you know=20
what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year?

We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I assume this would=20
all be for CES/New Power.  If you know of any other Sonat storages we had fo=
r=20
the 2000 tax year, please let me know.

Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you.

Thanks
Chris.
