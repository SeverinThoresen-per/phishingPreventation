Chris:

I received a call from Mike Danielson today.  He works for the West Power=20
Origination group under Chris Calger.  He was interested in learning more=20
about what has been transpiring  with PD.  He recently met with Ariz. Elect.=
=20
Power Coop, (AEPCO) who floated the idea of Enron selling them fixed price=20
power at Palo Verde and AEPCO selling phyiscal to meet PD needs after the=20
AEPCO contract with PD expires. =20

We got Joe Robertson on the telephone who indicated you are meeting with PD=20
perhaps today.

As we have discussed, our strategy is to not call PD and allow you guys to=20
work your magic and let us know when you need assistance on gas or energy=20
pricing or physical delivery.
=20
Can you give us an update of your efforts so far?  Is there anything that we=
=20
should be doing at this time?

Thanks!

Chris
