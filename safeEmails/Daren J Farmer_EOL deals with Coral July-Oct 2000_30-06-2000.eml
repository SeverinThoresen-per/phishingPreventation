During June, Coral transacted on EOL.  However, they selected a July thru=20
October deal by mistake.  The marketer immediately called the desk and we=20
agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a=20
second deal in EOL.  Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it=20
was unwound.  But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm=20
transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to=20
zero volume and price.  Logistics will be brokering the transactions in=20
MOPS.  Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals. =20
Again, they will not have a record of the deals.

The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653.

Let me know if you have any questions.
