Mr. Lay

We are getting blasted in the news and a lot of the information is false. Th=
ere is NO one there to tell the complete truth.  Americans are getting the n=
ews that the media wants them to hear and it is not the full truth. Don't we=
 need a spokesman to counter the lies?=20

In the end even if there were no wrong doing, it won't matter because the me=
dia (and politicians) have said the same lies over and over and finally Amer=
icans believe it no matter if it is the truth or not. Day after day they hav=
e people on who say, "I heard that Enron has fired 20,000 employees".  They =
never have someone on that really knows.  And, "Enron benefited from 17 prov=
isions in this law".  WELL - - so did Dynegy, and Williams and El Paso and o=
n and on.  And, "Enron only paid taxes one out of five years".  WELL - - how=
 many large companies did the same?  And, "Ken Lay called O'Neil".  WELL - -=
 how many CEO's of large companies called him?  No one is there to represent=
 Enron.  Enron has done things wrong, but it doesn't help if no one is there=
 to stop the half truths and flat out lies.=20

Please allow someone who has the knowledge and skills to go on TV and tell b=
oth sides.=20
Thanks. Cecil
