Andrew,

As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of=
 mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests. There is anothe=
r way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.

Second, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventor=
y number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit,=
 more in line with the historical average now.

Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything a=
dditional in the inventory forecast sheet.
