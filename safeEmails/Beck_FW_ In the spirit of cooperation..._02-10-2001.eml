John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately=
 occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues i=
n his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify tea=
m was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handle=
d during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to your=
 attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know that eve=
ryone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to st=
ay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team=
 who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that c=
ould or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar=
 role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination deadlines =
and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can crea=
te real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is=
 impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure te=
am that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.  Thanks.  =

Unfortunately, we didn't get a notification - we played detective.
=20
In their defense, they had tried to do the resynchronization after-hours a c=
ouple of times and it failed, so they were somewhat desperate to get this do=
ne.  Nonetheless, a phone call should have been made to our team in advance.

Thanks for the updates.  When we had the problem with the server resynchroni=
zation, did someone from the Infrastructure team alert you ahead of time tha=
t they were going to do this during normal business hours, or did you have t=
o be the detective to determine the cause once the problem was at hand.  Let=
 me know. Thanks. --Sally=20

Subject: Unify Operational Status
Here is a summary of Unify operations for today.  My plan was to provide the=
se reports to this audience through the end of this week, and then pick up a=
gain during next bid week.  I'll be glad to continue this type of reporting =
moving forward, please let me know if you are interested.  Alternatively, I =
could move to a weekly reporting of issues, and/or change the audience of th=
is report.  Your feedback on the matter is appreciated.

Summary of 9/28:
=B7         Heavy activity in the Gas system, especially in the afternoon.  =
System performance dropped during the afternoon, but no downtime was experie=
nced.=20
=B7         At just after 3:00 pm, a network server experienced problems and=
 as a result one of our EDI servers was unable to accept new files.  No EDI =
files could be sent to our hub as a result.  As it turns out, the Infrastruc=
ture team was in the process of performing a critical re-synchronization on =
that server, and the server was unable to write new data to disk for over an=
 hour (during re-synchronization this window is typically just a few minutes=
).  Infrastructure typically conducts resynchronizations after-hours, but re=
synchronization had failed on this box on several prior attempts, so the iss=
ue had become critical.  At 4:26 pm, the re-synchronization completed and al=
l EDI files in the queue were processed normally, and our 5:00 pm intraday n=
om deadline was met. =20
Action Items:
o        The network servers referenced are to be decommissioned on October =
5th, and will be replaced with newer more reliable servers.  This is part of=
 a planned project within the Infrastructure team.=20
o        I have discussed the issue with the Infrastructure team and communi=
cated our various intra-day processing deadlines.  They have committed to no=
tifying the Unify team in the event future emergency-type maintenance is req=
uired during business hours.=20
=B7         On the Power side, we have caught up on all of our processing th=
at was delayed as a result of yesterday's outage. =20
