Dearest Brother and Sister,

First of all HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We Talked about you and how improtant our
family is on several occasions during the last few days. Hope your
Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
stayed behind and did other things including watching "Hurricane", a very
powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
important people for us and for the whole family.

We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
at your  best.

Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
you
 can.
Ken We discussed getting together in Dec. That may not be possible because
of all of our schedules. If not lets look at jAN. For both of you, what does
your schedule look like?
Thats all for now. Let me know about the family reunion date (Sat, Aug. 11)
as soon as possible. Talk to you soon. Love. Bonnie
