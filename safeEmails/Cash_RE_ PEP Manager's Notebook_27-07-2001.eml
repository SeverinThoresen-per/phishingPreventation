Michelle,

We are interested in developing a "Manger's Notebook" that would allow Manag=
ers to keep notes on employee's performance throughout the six month period =
of PEP.  Issues surrounding the use and storage need to be discussed before =
we begin our project.

Please let me know when you are available to meet and I'll make the arrangem=
ents.

Thanks,

Dave
