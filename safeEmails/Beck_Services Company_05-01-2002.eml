Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of t=
he Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of =
our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid a=
nd back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured int=
o Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there c=
ould be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured=
 our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on D=
ecember 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November an=
d the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in =
mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that=
 the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enron that was=
 offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to "win again" as=
 Enron. =20

Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the =
formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within =
EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we=
 did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage=
 in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be=
 to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide s=
ome capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the p=
otential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron employees ta=
king jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "independent=
" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estate could be=
 the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structu=
re of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced costs for syst=
ems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLo=
gic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engag=
ements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems =
and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - =
a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it=
 much more likely that these people could be retained. =20

Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There i=
s definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We ask=
ed him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I=
 believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this.  O=
ur ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our hope wo=
uld  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that a=
sset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. =20

The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dilig=
ence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consider=
ation.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It w=
ould be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be foll=
owed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit to t=
he proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's C=
ommittee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding pr=
ocess on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it w=
ould be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. =20

Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally=20
