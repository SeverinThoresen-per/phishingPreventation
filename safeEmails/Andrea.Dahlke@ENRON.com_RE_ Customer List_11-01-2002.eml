I've done the 12/31 adhoc queries for this and have saved it in the 'New' fo=
lder...12-31 AdHoc - Performing Counterparties.  Once we move the counterpar=
ties to the Perv (I mean Perf) book we can use this file to determine the pr=
ior days associated.

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for =
the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet ide=
ntifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contrac=
ts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then =
need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books=
=2E  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the co=
unterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously th=
ese transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the =
P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value=
 will need to be in Schedule E.
