Subject: TMR earnings

TMR earnings report tomorrow...

I've been watching this sector -  ie small cap oil&gas.
Most companies have risen prior to earnings, but then have a pretty good=20
sell-off
after announcing record earnings.

Examples:=20
 CHK earnings report on 2/20 stock price=3D$10.80, by 2/24 stock price =3D $=
9.10.
 GW earnings report on 2/12 price =3D $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.
 OEI earnings 1/25 price $18.05, then 1/30 $16.75 but today $19.00
 DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
 CRK earnings 2/14 price =3D $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20
=20
So...buy the rumor, sell the fact ????
I still want to hold TMR long term, but maybe take a little profit tomorrow=20
?????????
