PRESIDENT SIGNS BROWNFIELDS LEGISLATION

Last week, President Bush signed legislation aimed at boosting clean up of b=
rownfields, abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial properties. =
 Redevelopment of these properties is hindered by possible environmental con=
tamination and potential liability.  The bill provides liability protection =
for contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landown=
ers and authorizes increased funding for state and local programs that asses=
s and clean up brownfields.  The legislation had bipartisan support.

The President also announced that his FY 03 budget will double the funds ava=
ilable through the EPA for FY02, to help states and communities around the c=
ountry clean up and revitalize these sites.   Urban redevelopment and brownf=
ields cleanup also will be funded at a level of $25 million through the Depa=
rtment of Housing and Urban Development.
