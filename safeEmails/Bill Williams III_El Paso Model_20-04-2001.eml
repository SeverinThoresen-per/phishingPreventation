Group,

For the third day in a row (4th time this week) I have received an email or=20
call from Kathy at EPE asking the model to be resent because of simple=20
errors.  Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking ou=
t=20
with counterparties and running the CARP.  The ancillary service (spin) deal=
s=20
need to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular=20
deal entry summary.  We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriat=
e=20
(which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston trie=
s=20
to check out March and April).  We do a good job trading for EPE and managin=
g=20
their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for this=20
customer on deal entry.  I continue to see the same mistakes which suggests=20
that procedure questions exist.  Please ask myself or a senior member of the=
=20
group if you have any questions.  I look for us to improve going forward.

Thanks,

Bill
