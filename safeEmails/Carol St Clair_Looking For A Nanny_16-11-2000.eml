I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4=
=20
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can=20
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We=20
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone=
=20
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you=20
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I=
=20
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me=20
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think=20
might be able to help.  Thanks.
