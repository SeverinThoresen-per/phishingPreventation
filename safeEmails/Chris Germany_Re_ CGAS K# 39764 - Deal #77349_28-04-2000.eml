The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the=20
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handlin=
g=20
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the=20
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges=20
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,
Brenda
