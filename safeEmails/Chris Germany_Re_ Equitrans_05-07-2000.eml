Subject: Equitrans



I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=3D1,000/day, start date =3D 7/1/97, max demand, all rec=
eipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with=20
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper=
=20
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks
