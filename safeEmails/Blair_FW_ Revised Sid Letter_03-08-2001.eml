Maria,
=20
I think the revised paragraph focuses on the wrong point.   The lack of take=
-away capacity alone wouldn't make a firm customer prefer a volumetric rate.=
  It's the problem of not knowing from day to day whether such firm transpor=
tation will be confirmed at the border (i.e. the windowing procedure). =20
=20
My feeling is that the desire for a volumetric rate isn't driven by capacity=
, but by transactional uncertainty. =20
=20
I would suggest that we use the orginal paragraph -- but drop the discussion=
 of takeaway capacity and focus on the window procedure.
