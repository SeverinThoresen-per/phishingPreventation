Hello everyone,

Sometimes it is necessary to figure out how certain costs can be distributed=
=20
evenly and fairly among our groups here at the Portland West Desk.  Below yo=
u=20
will find an attachment that will automatically calculate the percentage=20
breakdown for each group, after entering the total amount in the space=20
provided.  The cell above "enter bill total here" is the sum of the column t=
o=20
its left.  It should equal the bill total.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
Anna
