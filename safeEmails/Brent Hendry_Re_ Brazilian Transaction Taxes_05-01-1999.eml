Scott:=20

I have provided some comments below in response to your questions regarding=20
Brazil trading activities. About a year ago, Jordan and I went with Brent an=
d=20
others to Sao Paulo to do some preliminary due diligence on Brazil trading=20
issues.  At that time there were a number of open issues regarding the legal=
,=20
regulatory and commercial aspects of conducting trading activities in Brazil=
=20
that would effect our planning.  For example, it was not known whether a=20
Brazil trading office would be considered a financial institution, an=20
important characterization as financial institutions are subject to a=20
different tax regime.  =20

In any event, the following should give you a flavor of the regime.  I am=20
also sending you under separate cover some general information regarding=20
doing business in brazil: =20

Brazil imposes two gross receipts taxes called Pis and Cofins.  The Pis rate=
=20
is 0.65% and the Cofins rates has just increased from 2% to 3% effective=20
February 1, 1999.=20
=20
Pis/Cofins operate like the Argentine turnover taxes except that Pis/Cofins=20
are federal taxes as compared to Argentina's turnover taxes which are=20
assessed at the provincial level. =20

Strictly speaking, Brazil law considers amounts paid for Pis/Cofins to be=20
"social contributions" and not  taxes as the funds are earmarked for certain=
=20
social welfare programs.    As a result, the Pis/Cofins are considered=20
"sacred" and except as outlined below, there are no exemptions or=20
opportunities to avoid payment of Pis/Cofins. =20

There are only two exceptions to the payment of Pis/Cofins.  First, export=20
sales by Brazilian companies are not subject to gross receipts taxes.  The=20
second exemption is that charitable foundations are exempt from Pis and=20
Cofins.  Prior to Brazil's recently introduced tax reform package, financial=
=20
institutions paid a higher rate of income tax but were exempt from the Cofin=
s=20
tax (Pis was still due).  Now, financial institutions must pay Cofins. =20

To mitigate the cascading effect of Pis/Cofins in some of our power project=20
under development, we have looked at, but not implemented, forming=20
consortiums with some of our suppliers (gas suppliers). Under this scenario,=
=20
a portion of the energy payment is allocated to each supplier who is taxable=
=20
only on the portion of the tariff to which he contributed.  A consortium is =
a=20
legal arrangement that applies to a specific transaction and specific=20
customers. It may not be compatible in the context of a trading office.     =
 =20

Brazil has a value added tax  regime which is administered by each state. =20
There can be mismatches between VAT paid and collected depending on the=20
particular jurisdiction in which a commodity is bought and resold.   The VAT=
=20
regimes differs for gas and power trading so we would have to analyze each=20
specific transaction in order to evaluation whether VAT would represent a=20
cost to the Brazil tradeco.   I am sending to you some information provided=20
by Arthur Andersen which describes the VAT on sales and re-sales of gas and=20
electricity under several scenarios, =20

I am also checking on whether Brazil imposes any energy specific taxes and=20
will follow up you separately on this issue.  =20
Regards and all the best in 1999.

Beth: I think we have a pretty good handle on these issues with respect to=20
the Pis/Cofins--not pretty and, in fact, a worse scenario than we face in=20
Argentina.  Would you communicate to Scott.
Thanks.
Jordan

PS-I must have just missed you today to run-I'm so sorry I couldn't make it,=
=20
but it was for a very valid reason.

Subject: Brazilan Transaction Taxes




Can you give us a briefing on Brazilian transaction taxes?  My initial
feeling is that we are going face tax
issues similar to those we are dealing with in Argentina.  We have several
deal makers in Sao Paulo that have
begun contact potential customers. I think it is important to start the
education process now for all of us so that we can
1) determine ways to structure deals to limit tax liability and 2) form a=20
strategy to lobby for changes/reform/exemption.

Some initial questions:

How are marketing/trading companies activities treated?
Are there any energy specific taxes?
If turnover/gross receipt tax are applicable, is there any special treatment=
=20
for trading companies?
Are transaction taxes federal, state, or local in nature?

Thanks for your help.
