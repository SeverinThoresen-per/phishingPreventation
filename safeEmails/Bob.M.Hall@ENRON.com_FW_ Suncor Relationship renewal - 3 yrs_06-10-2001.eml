FYI.  Looks like we got the extension of the Suncor outsourcing agreement.  =
They had some key staff changes about a year ago and the team has worked ver=
y hard to build relationships with the new players.  Is it possible to get 8=
 more of the 100 point Enron bucks.  They would be a nice token to give the =
key players in the logistics group as a reward for contributing to this rene=
wal.  Let me know what you think.

Peggy, Laura,
On Monday this week I completed negotiations with Suncor to extend the servi=
ces arrangement for a 3 yr term out of Jan 1, 2002.  The scope of work will =
remain as is today, and we will cover IES and SEMI volumes as we do today.
Over the whole negotiation, one item that was never raised was the quality o=
f our back-office services.  They never questioned the quality of the work o=
f your two groups (or the commercial group for that matter).  The issues dur=
ing the negotiation were related to cost, scope, strategy (do they want us a=
t all) and term.
Thanks as always for the great work of your teams.  I'd be happy to review t=
he deal with the key individuals as we did with PCOG, if you wish.  I'd just=
 like to wait for the signed agreement to be in place - 'cause you never kno=
w.  Peter already has the first draft of an agreement ready so we should get=
 that through soon.
