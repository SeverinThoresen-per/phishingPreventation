Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before=
 us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Serge=
i is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.   =20

I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my na=
nny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Cha=
d at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.

Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  =
Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home =
to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina=
 to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is th=
e fact that Alina is still scared o Kim.

Ginger,
I was able to get Ginger on her cell phone. She said, that we were the first=
=20
to go in, that the other group was a different region, and that they had to=20
go in order and that their paper work was in before ours. She said she was=20
not sure what Chris had told me, but would get with her about it when she=20
gets back. I do NOT like it all, but will try to give them the benefit of th=
e=20
doubt that this is the best that can be done.

I also asked about the 2 weeks prior to court date, and the 2 weeks after=20
court date, and she said as of now only the 2 weeks prior is being waived,=20
but that Sergei is still working on it and will not have the answer until he=
=20
has our court date and papers.
I also asked (again) about only 1 parent travelling and she said that to her=
=20
knowledge there has been no law change to allow that, and I asked (again)=20
what about a waiver or something and she did say they have been asking that=20
question of Kazakhstan but no answer yet.

There is the option of having your child escorted back by future family,=20
Ginger didn't think I would want to do that, and she is right, but I guess i=
t=20
is an option.

Well, at least we for sure will be able to do the conference.

Liz
