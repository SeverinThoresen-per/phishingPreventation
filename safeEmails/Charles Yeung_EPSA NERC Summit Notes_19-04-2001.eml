On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future=20
participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at=20
least in the near term because of their "monopoly" on the=20
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into=20
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the=20
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry=
=20
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged=
=20
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed=
=20
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in respons=
e=20
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems ar=
e=20
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to=20
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the=20
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide=20
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC=20
structure. =20

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide=20
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater=20
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and=20
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only=20
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as=20
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NER=
C=20
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the=20
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who=20
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem=20
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no "bright=20
line" between the two.

Please contact me if you wish more details of the meeting.
