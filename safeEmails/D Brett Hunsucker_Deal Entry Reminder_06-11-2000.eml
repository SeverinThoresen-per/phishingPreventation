All

The group has been doing a great job with deal entry - with a few=20
exceptions.  I just want to go over a some basics:

Make sure your price index is appropriate for the delivery point.  If you=20
enter a delivery point of Malin, Capt Jack, or COB, your price index should=20
reference NW1,  not NW3, NW2, etc.   If it's a Day-Of (Hour-Ahead) deal, mak=
e=20
sure the price index reflects that, i.e., it has the "HA" in the index.

If the deal is such that the PX is doing the import/export for us (title to=20
the power changes hands at a tie point, versus in a load zone such as NP, SP=
=20
or ZP), the counterparty should be California Power Exchange - Scheduling=20
Coordinator (CalPX-SC).  This lets people know EPMI is not the=20
importer/exporter of the power - the PX is responsible for that. =20

If you buy/sell from/to the PX @ NP, SP or ZP, the counterparty is simply=20
California Power Exchange (CalPX). =20

If the deal is due to a real-time cut, the counterparty is California PX -=20
Time Removal.  The price should an ISO-based index and it should always be=20
either ISOHANP15inc/dec, or ISOHASP15inc/dec.  Currently there are some=20
messages (in Deal Entry and Deal Blotter) tied to the Time-Removal=20
counterparty that indicate the price should be either ISOHANP15 or ISOSP15=20
(without the Inc/Dec ).  For now, ignore that message and make sure the inde=
x=20
included Inc/Dec.  When IT releases a new version of Deal Entry and Deal=20
Blotter, we'll be able to better manage these "checks".  Also, even though=20
the index should be based on the ISO for these types of deals, the delivery=20
point should still be the actual delivery point, such as PV, 4C, etc. =20

It's important these deals are entered correctly.  If they're not, the P/L=20
that is reported to mgt is incorrect - and it will be until I come thru to=20
settle. =20

Thanks.

Brett
