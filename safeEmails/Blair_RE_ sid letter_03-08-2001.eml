    Maria, I wanted to follow up after discussions with you and Shelley, the=
 SoCal window is based on what SoCal=20
    is willing to confirm into their system for the day.  It does not necess=
arily have anything to do with physical capacity at Needles.
    If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks.  Lynn

I'll defer to you guys on getting the specific words right, but it would be =
great if we can get something like this.  Steve Harris needs to take a close=
 look to make sure we are describing the windowing impacts correctly.  Lawye=
rs:  will a letter from Sid be admissable evidence under FERC evidence rules=
?  We may need to ask them to have Scott sign it instead of their lawyer to =
assure admissability.  DF

Richardson has agreed to send us an additional writing regarding the other j=
ustifications for the volumetric negotiated rate.   Joe Koury asked me to em=
ail the insert to the letter.   Koury told me that he would reference the Ju=
ly 26 order and the fact that the Commission has requested additional inform=
ation as to why the shipper entered into the subject negotiated rate transac=
tion, with Scott Walker stating that in reviewing his previous responses he =
would clarify by adding the following: =20


Insert: =20
 =20
Richardson Products proposed to share in a rate based on a daily spread as a=
 volumetric rate because under that rate arrangement if the gas did not flow=
, Richardson was not obligated to pay Transwestern the rate.  Richardson des=
ired to avoid the risk, under normal demand service, of having to pay the ra=
te if the gas did not flow.   The issue of whether the gas would flow was a =
very real one at the California border (Needles delivery point) given the ma=
nner in which SoCalGas, the downstream party, confirms volumes for delivery =
with Transwestern.   Specifically, SoCalGas has a windowing procedure whereb=
y it limits the amount of gas that Transwestern can deliver into Needles bas=
ed on SoCalGas' allocation procedures and the amount of available takeaway c=
apacity at the delivery point. [True?]  Simply stated, if SoCalGas did not c=
onfirm Richardson's nomination at the Needles delivery point, the gas would =
not flow.    The negotiated rate, as opposed to the rate for normal demand s=
ervice, allowed Richardson to avoid the risks associated with Richardson's g=
as not flowing due to SoCalGas's windowing procedure.  =20

 Pls. review and comment asap.   I promised Joe K.  I would get it to him to=
night or first thing tomorrow because he will be out all next week and agree=
d to take care of this matter this week.  Thanks, Maria
