I think we should do a settlement of the accounts receivable.  Although the =
effect is the same, it would be better to be able to say that we don't retie=
r.  Any body have another opinion?  Dari

	Here is what I called about:   WTG is a small customer (Tariff Sheet No. 51=
0) and are entitled to a 1000 MMBtu in tier one of their imbalance rather th=
an the 3%.  However,  WTG Marketing actually was nominating on their own con=
tract for WTG (small customer) and therefore was not receiving the small cus=
tomer 1000 in tier one.  WTG  feels they were misled by Northern and thought=
 they would receive the 1000 tier one because they were nominating to a smal=
l customer point.  If they would have understood that the 1000 Tier One was =
only applicable to the WTG's (small customer) contract. WTG Marketing would =
have nom'd as an agent on behalf of WTG (small customer) using WTG's (small =
customer) contract.

Okay here is the question:  Marketing and Gas Logistics is asking if they ca=
n retier retroactively to March 2001 up to current.  We have retiered for ot=
her reasons in the past due to our own measurement problems and this also ap=
pears to be Northern's "mistake" by providing misinformation.  What is your =
feel for this or  would be better to enter into a "settlement" with WTG Mark=
eting so as not to set a precedent. =20

Lynn or Janet,  feel free to straighten me out if I have the story confused.
