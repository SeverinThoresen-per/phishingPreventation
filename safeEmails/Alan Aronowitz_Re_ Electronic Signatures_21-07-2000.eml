David:

Yes, the UCC (Article 2) would be the basis for not requiring a signed=20
confirmation from the counterparty receiving the confirmation if the physica=
l=20
product is a "good" under the UCC. This I think answers your second question=
=20
also.

Thanks for sending the chart.  I will send you the list of questions we=20
discussed tomorrow.  In the interim, I had a couple of questions on the=20
chart:  On the first line (physical, no master), is the basis for not=20
requriing the confirm to be signed the UCC?  Also, what is meant by "unless=20
commodity not 'good'"?

Thanks.
