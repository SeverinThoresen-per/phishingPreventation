201 Situation:

Powell Goldstein called to clarify what the situation is after several=20
misleading trade press articles indicated that the Administration was leanin=
g=20
against filing a Section 201 initiation.   The Bottom Line is:  the=20
Administration is still very much undecided on how to proceed on a 201=20
investigation and even more undecided on which remedy to implement if harm i=
s=20
found.   We have learned from Senior level officials they are considering th=
e=20
following options:

Option 1: The Administration will initiate a Section 201 investigation on=20
steel with an accompanying statement saying that the initiation does not in=20
anyway indicate if and what remedy would be implemented.  The threat to an=20
Administration investigation, is that quotas are the expected remedy.  By=20
taking this approach, the Administration would allow the ITC to determine if=
=20
the imports are trade related or a result of industry market structure, whil=
e=20
placing a chilling effect on the possible implementation of quotas.   The=20
USTR supports this approach; the Department of Treasury has not been persuad=
e=20
it is prudent; the  Department of Commerce is trying to negotiate the middle=
=20
ground; and the White House is still undecided.

Option 2:  Allow the Senate Finance Committee to initiate a 201=20
investigation, but issue a similar statement indicating no remedy=20
commitment. =20

Timing:=20

The EU-US Summit is meeting the second week of June and this will be on the=20
agenda, so do not expect anything before June 14.  The Senate Finance=20
Committee is in transition after Sen. Jeffords switched parties and the=20
Committees are being reformulated, which could take several weeks.  Look to=20
the end of June for a decision by the Administration.  The Administration=20
will face pressure to make a decision after the Steel Workers converge on=20
Washington next week. =20

Remedy:

There has been some confusion about a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA)=20
being negotiated in place of a 201 investigation.  We have learned that this=
=20
is not going to happen.  The MSA is one of the possible remedies, but the=20
Administration has made it clear that it would only be a possible remedy if =
a=20
Sec. 201 investigation is initiated.  An MSA would require voluntary=20
restraints negotiated between all steel producing nations.  Another option=20
are voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) which are bilaterally negotiated=20
agreements.   The other options are well known:  quotas, tariffs,=20
quantitative restrictions, etc. =20
