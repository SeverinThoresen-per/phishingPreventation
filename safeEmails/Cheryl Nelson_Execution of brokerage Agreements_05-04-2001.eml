Hey Stephanie, I can see that you are super super swamped, so I am trying to=
=20
help by doing some of the paralegal work to get several of the URGENT=20
brokerage agreements done.  I do need your help on the following:

1. As I mentioned earlier today, the last few tasks I left for you for Enron=
=20
Credit Inc. are critical.  I jsut need for you to call that contact to find=20
out when they will have the tax I.D. number and let her know that we=20
corrected the final slate of officers via Richard Sage and not by the info i=
n=20
the system and we want the info in the system updated right away.  We were=20
able to get certain key documents to Bear in order to open the account but=20
that stunt was contigent on our getting to them the outstanding information=20
immediately thereafter and they are calling us on it.  Sara represented to m=
e=20
that this work was extremely urgent. =20

Sara, maybe you can provide some guidance to Stephanie about whether she=20
should put extra focus on these other tasks.

2.  As per my previous emails yesterday and today, please have the documents=
