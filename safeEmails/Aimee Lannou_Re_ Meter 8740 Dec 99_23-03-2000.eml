We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midte=
x=20
line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy,=
=20
I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts=20
from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the=20
Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, yo=
u=20
may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL=
=20
Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex=20
line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy=
=20
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec.=20
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the=20
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party=20
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to=20
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please le=
t=20
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The=20
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole an=
d=20
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the=20
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so=
=20
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me=20

Thanks.

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our=
=20
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the othe=
r=20
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract=
=20
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL=
=20
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I=20
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

Thu
