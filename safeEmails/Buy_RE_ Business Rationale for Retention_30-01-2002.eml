Rick,=20

We are still going to need the business rationale for each employee placed o=
n a retention or milestone program. This information will be required by the=
 creditors. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.=20

As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in th=
e retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why the=
se employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please pr=
ovided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally,=
 if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vu=
lnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if yo=
ur unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary =
to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of a=
ssets, include this in your business summary.=20

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a sim=
ilar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended f=
or the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, s=
o please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking =
time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please=
 call me (5x3662) if you have any questions.=20

Regards,
Frank
