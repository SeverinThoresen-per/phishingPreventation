Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  =
I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a bui=
lder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took fr=
om our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a me=
tal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is a=
lso a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf=
 and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I =
don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering =
about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC=
 spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost t=
han SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will sp=
ray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compar=
ed to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insu=
lation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contra=
ctors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying=
 to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.
