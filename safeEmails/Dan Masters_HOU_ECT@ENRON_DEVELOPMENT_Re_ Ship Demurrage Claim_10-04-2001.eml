Rick-
Since this is not a claim and simply a letter of protest, no response is req=
uired by us nor would one be expected of us by Cabot or the ship.  Please se=
e my email from earlier for further information or give me a call when you g=
et a chance.

Subject:	Ship Demurrage Claim

Dan,

Victor and I did discuss the demurrage claim.  As I understand the facts, th=
is does not appear to be a valid claim.

I am looking to your group to evaluate the merits of the claim.  If you conc=
lude that the claim is valid, please prepare memo to Victor with copy to me,=
 explaning why the claim is valid.  If on the other hand, you conclude the c=
laim is not valid, then please prepare a letter to Cabot ( for Victor's sign=
ature) explaning why the claim is not valid.

Rick
