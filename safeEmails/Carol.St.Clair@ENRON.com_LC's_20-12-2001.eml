Just a quick update on the LC situation.  We sent a renewal request to Enser=
co yesterday and they said they would get back to us tomorrow.  If they don'=
t renew by tomorrow I think that we should send them a notice of Event of De=
fault letter which would give them until Wednesday to cure.  If not cured by=
 Wednesday, we could terminate and be in a position to draw on Thursday/Frid=
ay.  Who can I coordinate with next week on this?

Leslie Reeves is checking on a few of them that owe payments this week to se=
e if they have paid.

On Vitol, Tom is obtaining a copy of the LC and seeing if they have paid.  H=
e is also checking into Ballarpur.

Greg Johnston e-mailed me to say that they were handling EPCORE and Engage.

We have concluded that nothing can be done on Energy Service Providers, Traf=
igura and Glencore.
