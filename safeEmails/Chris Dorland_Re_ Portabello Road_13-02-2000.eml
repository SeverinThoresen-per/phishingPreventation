Mike,

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats=20
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good=20
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy=20
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the=20
weekend.=20

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very=
=20
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look=20
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I=
=20
think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush=20
Juice for a falafel.

Good luck and keep in touch!

Chris
