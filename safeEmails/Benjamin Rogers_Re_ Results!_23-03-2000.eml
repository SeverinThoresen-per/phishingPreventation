Professor Ronn:=20
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA=20
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it=20
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences,=20
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my=20
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you=20
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right=20
place to continue learning about energy-finance. =20
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent=20
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do=20
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three=20
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and=20
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this=20
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability,=
=20
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the=20
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University=20
Graduate School of Business. =20
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a=
=20
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and=20
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to=20
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know. =20
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers
