Sempra needs to get a copy of the court order authorizing ENA to enter into =
GISB's and transactions.  Does such a thing exist that we can send to Sempra=
?

Thanks

Chris:

There are some issues with the attached form - who do I send revisions to?
In addition, our legal department needs to get a copy of the court order
authorizing ENA to enter into GISBs and transactions - who do contact
regarding this issue?

Regards - Michael McCall

These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new
GISB than to find any of the existing documents.  The attached document is
for Enron North America Corp.  David is going to see if they can use it.

If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the
Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.

Thanks
