This meeting was to discuss the evolution or history of Crude and Products f=
rom EEL to EGM, who the players were, etc. =20

This history really applies to Michael L. Brown, Botchlett and Straube.

Let me know if you decide that the meeting is not critical at this time; oth=
erwise we will leave it scheduled as is.

Thanks,
Shanna
