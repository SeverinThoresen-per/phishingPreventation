When you get allocations for January, we need to look at daily volumes for=20
Transaction #1. Towards the end of the month, Entex was approaching its Jan=20
winter cap volume of 550,000/day. If the daily volume for Trans #1 comes out=
=20
greater than 550, the excess must be charged at GD+10. The numbers thus far=20
show that they did not exceed 550. However, the allocated volumes tend to=20
differ.=20

Thanks,
AC
