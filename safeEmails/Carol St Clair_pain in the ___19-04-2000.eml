I hate to keep asking "what can I do to help the process along" but I am.
My understanding is that our attorney, Mike Kessler, has faxed the motion
back to Enron and is waiting for a go ahead before we have it filed.  Should
you need me to come downtown to sign any of the amendments, or explain what
we are doing, please do hesitate to cal me at 713-964-9444
