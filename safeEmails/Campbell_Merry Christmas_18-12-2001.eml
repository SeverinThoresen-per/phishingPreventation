David got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with y=
ou, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vac=
ation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked =
to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in Houst=
on.  Enron is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of thin=
gs are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you m=
ay have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Steve=
ns were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about wha=
t is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my =
vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying =
on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a g=
ood feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine=
=2E

Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute=
 for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.

David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Chris=
tmas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and ref=
lect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, i=
t becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful=
 witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of Chr=
ist that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great=
 High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit =
has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of=
 Holies.  May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His =
love and grace.

Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ=20
