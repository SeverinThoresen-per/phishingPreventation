David:
In the severability language that you sent to me, one of the Sections that i=
s=20
referenced after the proviso is Section 13 of the ISDA Master which as you=20
know covers governing law and jurisdiction.  In our Schedule, we typically=20
amend  section 13 (b) to provide for arbitration.  We just want to make sure=
=20
that the language in the proviso should refer to both the governing law=20
provision as well as the jurisdiction/arbitration provisions.  I look forwar=
d=20
to hearing from you.

Carol
