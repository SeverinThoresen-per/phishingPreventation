Joe - I hope things are okay with your mom.=20

While I am out (back next Wednesday), please work with Jon Hoff on wrapping =
up the Batch Funding Request  and getting it in front of the Cash Committee =
(Chip is your contact).    I strongly recommend that you guys expedite the p=
aper shuffle as we are continually under transaction oversite risk. =20

Good Luck and I won't think about any of you while I'm gone.
