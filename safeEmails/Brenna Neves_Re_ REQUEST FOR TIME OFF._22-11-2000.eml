Those days off are fine.  See if you can get the calendar and put your days=20
on it.  I know that sounds backwards since you could have done it before, bu=
t=20
this way we can all get into the habit of emailing, getting a response and=20
then putting it on the calendar. =20

Sorry for the confusion.
