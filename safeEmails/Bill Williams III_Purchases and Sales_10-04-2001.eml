Dear Real Timers,

As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the=20
importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make=20
deals.  It is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours tha=
t=20
you are trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at=
=20
the end of your trade!! :) please...

There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neithe=
r=20
trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm=20
relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades.

Please see or e-mail me with any questions.

Thanks.

Virginia
