The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for th=
e=20
New Power Market Area.  We are still working on the East demand charges, the=
y=20
are not correct.  I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sale=
s=20
deal.

Is the $10,000/month scheduling fee part of the $1,193,725? Is the demand=20
charge for all of the reimbursements on all pipelines combined?

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't=20
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this=20
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month=20
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New=20
Power.
