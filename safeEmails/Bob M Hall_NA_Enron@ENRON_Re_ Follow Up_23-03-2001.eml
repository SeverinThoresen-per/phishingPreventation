Bob,

I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple wee=
ks ago.  We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down with =
Daren and working the off system scheduling.

I was talking with Daren last night and he had not heard anything about this=
=2E  I plan to begin working with Mark and Mary next week to learn how to sc=
hedule these pipes.  Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that w=
hat we had discussed is still planned.

Thanks for your time.

Mike=20
