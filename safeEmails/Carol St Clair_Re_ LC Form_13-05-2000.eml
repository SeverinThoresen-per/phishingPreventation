Karen:
Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the=20
amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are=20
going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I=20
personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing=20
condition is specified.
Carol

Carol:

The additional transfer language is sufficient.

I black lined an insert to address TEFP's concern that the letter of credit=20
may be exercised on
default, only when funds are owed.

Please advise if this change is acceptable to Enron.  (If it is, I will prin=
t=20
copies of the
attached, & replace the existing letter of credit format with the attached=20
document, so that
Susan does not have to generate executions copies again.)


Thank you,



Karen
