I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point=20
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon=20
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one=
=20
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending o=
n=20
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it=
=20
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.
