Anne:
Sorry about the mix-up.  I did talk to Mark Taylor and he agreed that we=20
could do something to address your concerns and wanted to address what=20
specific language we would be comfortable with when the next draft came and=20
we had a chance to sit down with our online business person and go through=20
it.  I look forward to receiving the next draft from you at which time we=20
will come up with some language taht hopefully works for the both of us.

Carol, the last time we spoke, I believe you were going to talk to Mark
about accepting revisions to 2(g) and 4  and advise if we could use an
amended ETA rather than the letter of amendments. (see my note of June 6).
To close this matter, I suggest I send you the ETA later today or Wed with
the revisions we requested and include the changes you made that we agreed
with. I will also include a cover letter we would both sign that once we
'click' the ETA is executed, but not the one on screen ,but the one attached
to the letter agreement.

Thank you for your help, and trust this is the easiest way to close this
file.

Congratulations for the new baby,

For now Anne

Ann:
Are you still working on sending us a new draft of the ETA amendment?  Our
folks
have been asking about it.  I will be leaving to go on maternity leave in
about
3-4 weeks and if there is anyway that we can reach closure on this before
then,
taht would be great.
