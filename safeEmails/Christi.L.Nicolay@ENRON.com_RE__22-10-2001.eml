Oscar -- At this point, FERC does not have jurisdiction over coops and munis=
 (most public power entities are non-jurisdictional) and cannot "force" them=
 to join RTOs.  TVA does not have to join an RTO either.  However, FERC does=
 have some carrots and sticks that it can use, for example, a public that do=
es not join an RTO could be precluded from using the jurisdictional (actuall=
y, the rest) of the transmission system.  Therefore, many will probably join=
 just as they have currently filed "reciprocity" tariffs at FERC in order to=
 have the advantages of using the system.  EK Coop currently has a reciproci=
ty tariff on file with FERC, so would probably have to withdraw it at some p=
oint if it decides not to join an RTO.

Also, requirements to make publics join RTOs are in the current legislative =
proposals before Congress.  I am not sure that any will actually pass; howev=
er, Enron is working on this too.

Other questions are answered below.

Christi/Mike:

In a meeting yesterday with East Kentucky Power Cooperative, they indicated =
that they will be joining a RTG to be headed by TVA which will essentially b=
ecome and RTO for Public Power entities.  We have also heard indirectly, tha=
t EK will make some type of filing/release that they are non-jurisdictional =
and therefore not required to join any=20
RTO.

I would like your comments on whether FERC can force EK into the MISO or All=
iance.

EK has mostly 161 kv line with some 345kv and is right in the middle of the =
North to South transfer that takes place between the Midwest and TVA.

Key questions:

1.  Can EK opt out of the process....even if they have a large transmission =
system
[Nicolay, Christi L.]   Currently, yes, see above for sticks.

2.  Will a RTG for public power be encouraged/discouraged.  If its discourag=
ed by FERC, can FERC shut it down?
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  FERC cannot actually tell publics that they cannot be=
 an RTG; however, FERC has the same sticks.  If legislatively or otherwise (=
through DOE) TVA ends up joining an RTO, these others in the vicinity of TVA=
 may well follow.

3.  Where in the process is the Public Power RTG?
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  I am not familiar with this RTG (I don't think they h=
ave filed anything at FERC and they do not have to.)  JOE C.- have you heard=
 anything?

any other comments would be helpful.


thanks

oscar
