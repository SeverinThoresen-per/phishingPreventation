department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would b=
e interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understan=
d how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an=
 interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conferen=
ce room to be available.
