Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualif=
y=20
Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuin=
g=20
bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify=20
this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using.
