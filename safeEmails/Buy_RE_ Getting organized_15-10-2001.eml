All:

We have set up the following recurring meetings:

1. One hour on Thursdays with Mark Haedicke and his legal team
2. One half hour on Monday and Wednesday with Bill, Molly, Teresa, Sharon, T=
racey, and Lisa.  Also Rita Bohner, Paul Darmitzel and Ed Essandoh of EES le=
gal will attend.   This meeting will be primarily for the dealing with the h=
igh volume of small EES deals.   The aim is to define the process and drill =
on implementation (notices, termination, physical disconnection, proofs of c=
laim, etc.).    Molly has made great strides here.
3. Sharon Sullo and Tracey Kozadinos are developing a standardized database =
for the effort.   Debbie Brackett has gotten involved on system feeds.  More=
 to come on this.

The initial thoughts with Mark Haedicke were to parse the debtors into two o=
r three baskets.   Smallest size would be a process.  We are grappling with =
whether we need a mid size and a large size process.

As not all these deals show up on the Hot Deals Report.   I have scratched o=
ut the top ten, high touch, efforts below:

1. PG&E
2. Edison
3. 360
4. NPW
5. Polaroid
6. California PX
7. Global Crossing
8. DPC LNG
9. EPIK
10. Cuiab=E1 Turbine 11

Regards,



Michael
