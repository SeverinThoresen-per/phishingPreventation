WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- UBS Warburg's bid to take over the energy trading b=
usiness of Enron Corp. (ENE) will require Federal Energy Regulatory Commissi=
on approval, FERC Chairman Pat Wood III confirmed Wednesday.=20
Once cleared by the bankruptcy court, FERC expects to receive an application=
 for approval of the deal under the commission's authority, Wood told report=
ers.=20
FERC's jurisdiction involves the transfer of Enron's commission-granted auth=
ority to regulate the rates at which Enron sells electricity and natural gas=
, said Cynthia Marlette, FERC's general counsel.=20
But Marlette indicated the commission is mulling whether to exert a broader =
regulatory reach over the deal. "The commission hasn't opined yet whether it=
 has jurisdiction over the corporate transfer," she said.=20
As announced in recent days, UBS Warburg, a unit of UBS AG (U.UBS), will ass=
ume Enron's trading business with little if any cash up front, while paying =
Enron royalties equal to 33% of pre-tax earnings.=20
The bankruptcy judge is due to rule on the deal later this week.=20
