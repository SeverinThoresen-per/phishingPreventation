David Doot left me a message that he had not heard back and he was expecting=
 our proposal yesterday (which we had not told him).  He also said that the =
bonding company was "rumbling" that it was not going to pay.  I do not know =
what their obligation is to pay, but I would think that "rumbling" is not de=
fault, yet.

Jim S. is going to call David Doot back this afternoon.
