Stacy:
I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we=20
need to do 2 things to the existing language:

1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's=20
Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".

2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of=20
subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.

We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the=20
draft that we send out.

Carol, =20

Sorry for the confusion.

1) Yes - the guaranty should cover both contracts - $75MM to cover the=20
aggregate $50MM threshold.
2)  I spoke with Jeff Hodge on whether or not this would work prior to=20
sending worksheets to you guys.  The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate=
=20
threshold for the counterparty.  The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a=20
$50MM threshold.  The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be=20
customized to the new concept.  The Master Physical threshold language is to=
=20
simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA=
=20
collateral threshold.  I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Maste=
r=20
Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts  - i.e.=20
"Exposure", "Termination Amounts" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the=
=20
ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master=20
Physical to their comfort level. =20

Please call me to confirm whether or not you need anything else on this  -=20
and whether or not you think it can go out today. =20

Thanks,

John

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification=20
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial=20
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical=20
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our=20
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although=20
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose=20
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Carol
