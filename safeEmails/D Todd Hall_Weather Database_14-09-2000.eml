Brent and Sally,

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it=20
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment. =20
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for=20
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working togethe=
r=20
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-i=
n=20
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business=20
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1=
=20
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we=
=20
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture,=20
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian=
=20
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

Todd

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather=20
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements=20
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the=20
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the=
=20
"Thunderball" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have=20
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for=20
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet=20
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls=20
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be=20
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definitio=
n=20
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel=20
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep i=
n=20
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one perso=
n=20
will manage the effort across teams.


Richard
