Hi John,

I assumed you knew the details but just realized from talking to Jay that yo=
u probably were not aware that Greg Whalley wanted us to put this on hold fo=
r North America until some FERC and CFTC issues were resolved. John Lavorato=
 however wanted to go ahead and have an internal only version and we needed =
an extra week to program the internal only restricted version. Given that we=
 have an intenal only version we don't need to conduct the test we had spoke=
n about before. Let me know if you need further information. Thanks.

Can I assume we are ready to test the limit orders?
