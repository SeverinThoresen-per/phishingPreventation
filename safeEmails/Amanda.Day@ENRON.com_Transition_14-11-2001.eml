Mr. Lay:

I appreciate the time you took to review my memo concerning internal communi=
cations suggestions. Cindy Olson called to thank me and Sarah Davis did meet=
 with me to discuss the memo.=20

I have some ideas regarding the transition and would like to share them with=
 you and/or your communication transition team.  Could you please put me in =
contact with your team handling the communications for the transition or mee=
t with me personally to discuss?  I would only take a few minutes of your ti=
me.

Thank you again for your time and all that you have done for us. You have a =
large following that are here to support you and Enron.  We just need direct=
ion from the top, more importantly, you.=20
