On behalf of Dave Neubauer,Frank Semin, Lynn Blair and Jodie Floyd:

In follow-up to our conference call Thursday morning, we would like to commu=
nicate the "To-dos" we are recommending.  It is very important that we get t=
he charts to Houston by the 3rd business day of the month.  We need to encou=
rage chart changers to get their charts in the mail immediately.  As the cha=
rts are received in Houston, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services=
 will be in charge of not only inputting the chart data, but also tracking a=
nd keeping a report on when each chart is received.  Once we determine which=
 charts are consistently late, we will determine what action needs to be tak=
en to get the charts in on time, whether it be Priority Mail Service or Over=
night Service.  Prior Period Adjustments will be done on each chart that is =
received late.  As we continue to work through this problem, ongoing researc=
h and planning will be done to ensure that a capital commitment is made to g=
et technology installed to eliminate this ongoing issue.

1) It is important that the Operations personnel communicate to the chart ch=
angers the importance of getting the charts in the mail box immediately.
2) Effective immediately, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services tr=
ack the receipt of the charts and provide a report to Gas Logistics (Jodie F=
loyd) and Marketing that details which charts aren't coming in on time.  We =
need to have the report shortly after GMS closes, so that we can make effort=
s to locate the missing charts and get them to Houston as soon as possible.
3) Once we identify the charts that we are coming in late, we will provide e=
ither Priority Mail envelopes or Overnight envelopes to those stations so we=
 can ensure that the chart will be on time the following month.
4) PPAs will continue on all charts that are received late.
5) Measurement will review possible technology to improve the accuracy of ou=
r measurements, i.e. temperature-based calculation, chart delineator.

If you have any questions, please contact Courtney Barker (Marketing) at (40=
2) 398-7130 or Jodie Floyd (Gas Logistics) at (713) 853-1465.

Please forward this on to any necessary personnel.
