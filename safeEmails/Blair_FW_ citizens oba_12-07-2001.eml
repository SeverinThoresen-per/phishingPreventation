It appears that Citizens is continuing to overschedule volumes, thus the oba=
 is still getting bigger.  Even though this oba will probably be cashed out,=
 should we allow them to continue to "overschedule"?
They have also been in a penalty situation the past few months.  When we do =
cash out, I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment.
