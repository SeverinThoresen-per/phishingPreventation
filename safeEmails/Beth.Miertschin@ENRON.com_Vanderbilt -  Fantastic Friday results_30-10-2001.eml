Vanderbilt Team -
We had a very successful and fun Fantastic Friday this weekend with our Vand=
erbilt candidates.  We invited 10 of them here for final round interviews.  =
All of them accepted the invitation and came this weekend.  Out of 10, 6 wil=
l receive offers and 4 will receive declines.  The offer letters will go out=
 today for overnight delivery.  Candidates have until 1-14-02 to reply to th=
e offer.

Recruiting is not over yet!  Now its cultivation time!!  I am going to assig=
n cultivation teams consisting of one senior person and two analysts to be i=
n contact with candidates weekly.  The analysts on the team are responsible =
for sending me a weekly email updating me on the candidate's status, includi=
ng any issues that may have come up.  If you do not have an assignment but w=
ant to help with this effort, please go ahead.  The more contact these candi=
dates have with us the better!  Of course, if you have any questions that yo=
u cannot answer, please contact me.

Thank you all for your help to this point, now its time to close the deal!!
Beth
