The only conversation I have had with Jeff regarding this topic was when I=20
was in Houston and he had inquired as to when I was returning, stating that=20
he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas=20
Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My=20
thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is=20
going to roll up to Jeff.  Do you want me to set up a conference call with=20
you, Scott Earnest and myself to discuss?  Subsequent to that we should=20
probably have a conference call with Jeff to get specifics.  Let me know wha=
t=20
I need to do on this.

Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had=20
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced tha=

he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business. =

(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably=20
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will=20
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure. =20

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely=

over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this=

business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations wit=

Jeff on this?  =20
