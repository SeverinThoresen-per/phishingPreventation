In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the=20
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well=20
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing=20
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may=
=20
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently=20
show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King=20
Ranch. =20

Thanks.
