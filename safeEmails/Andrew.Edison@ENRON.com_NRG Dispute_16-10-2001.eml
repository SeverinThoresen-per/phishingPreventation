On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communi=
cations that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
=20
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is tr=
uly awful.
=20
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about tr=
ying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
=20
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price th=
at Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of t=
he terms have been agreed to, "obviously we have to get agreements signed an=
d get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff."  Stone appears to recog=
nize that the deal is not complete:  "So we're really not done.  Fuck."
=20
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker=
 asking to get a confirm of the deal.
=20
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: "Rogers He=
rndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit =
guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, b=
ut they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the dea=
l is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information=
=2E"  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron ou=
t details.
=20
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him=
 up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really i=
s a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks "why =
don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?," Zurita replies:  =
"I think -- I say the deal is done."  Stone's next question:  "Well, let me =
ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you sti=
ll consider the deal done?"  Zurita's answer:  "Yep."  And there's more.  St=
one next asks: "Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five=
 years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand=
=2E"  Zurita's answer:  "The deal is done, yes."  Ouch.  This is not good.
=20
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms=
=2E  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not =
done. ("The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going t=
o take to have the agreement worked out"); ("What is my concern is how far a=
way are theyfrom getting done?").
=20
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to r=
eview the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if yo=
u want transcripts of the tapes. =20

P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, =
we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare =
the position paper later this week.
