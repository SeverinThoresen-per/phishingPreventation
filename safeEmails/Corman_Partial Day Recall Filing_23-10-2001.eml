II.
MOTION TO INTERVENE
The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of=
 pipelines.
2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the juris=
diction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pi=
pelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.=
  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstat=
e Pipelines.
The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 complian=
ce filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus h=
ave a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adeq=
uately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interst=
ate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.
III.
COMMENTS
            The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of th=
e Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorpora=
te the comments made therein.
            Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both =
themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issu=
e with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline=
 separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Seco=
nd, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about t=
he far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petiti=
on advocates.  =20
            Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a=
 copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during=
 the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on par=
tial day recall rights. =20
            For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attac=
hed comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the=
 Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

Re:            Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items 1 and 2=
 and R00026=20
=20
=20
At the scheduled December 14, 2000 GISB Executive Committee meeting, the age=
nda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards=
=2E  This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementati=
on of Order No. 637 requirements and related standards such as R00026.   Amo=
ng the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and reca=
lls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove cu=
rrent GISB restrictions against partial-day recalls.=20
=20
Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not full=
y address the far-reaching impact of flowing day recalls.  There are signifi=
cant operational concerns with these standards.  We are concerned about whet=
her the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled part=
y does not continue to flow, particularly during critical periods.  We are c=
oncerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate f=
or handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid.   The =
proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern - whether gas=
 has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled.  This does no=
t begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential=
 impact to other transactions across the grid. =20
=20
Given these operational concerns, we do not understand the rush to adopt flo=
wing day recall standards.  While we understand that this work is in respons=
e to R00026, we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to ful=
fill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No. 637.   Order No. 637 =
requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as=
 shippers acquiring original capacity.  There are no existing pipeline contr=
acting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capa=
city by a releasing shipper. Very few pipelines have received authorization =
to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly=
 flow rate throughout the day.   Further, most pipelines have not yet receiv=
ed approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctua=
tions or intraday variability.=20
=20
In the spirit of compromise, we have worked on and concurred with revised st=
andards that permit intraday releases.  However, under these revised standar=
ds, all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business D=
ays to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provision=
s are supported.  Nonetheless, throughout the negotiations on this compromis=
e approach, the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed =
flowing day recall standards. =20
=20
Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards, the pipelines=
 have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are suppor=
ted by the existing standards.  In this area, we have agreed to support a re=
vised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in=
 the Evening Nomination Cycle.  This allows a releasing shipper to recall ca=
pacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow.  While this timelin=
e supports a shorter notice for recalls, it still preserves the application =
of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releas=
ing and the replacement shippers.  Flowing day recalls, though, are a separa=
te issue.  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of=
 scheduling problems, overruns, imbalances and increased occurrences of Oper=
ational Flow Orders.  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowin=
g day recalls, pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall stan=
dards.=20
=20
Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of servi=
ce must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipelin=
e system, including firm services, interruptible services, and balancing and=
 operational provisions. Because these developments involve changes to tarif=
fs and customers service offerings, this is not an area that is currently ri=
pe for GISB development.
=20
The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts ident=
ified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to =
the BPS recommendation.
