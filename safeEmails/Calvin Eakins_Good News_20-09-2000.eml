Several, months ago Limas Jefferson wrote you a letter requesting your=20
support for business opportunities at Enron.  That letter was subsequently=20
forwarded to Cindy Olson and me.  As you can see from the note below, we wer=
e=20
able to arrange for Jefferson & Associations to partner with Compaq on the=20
Windows 2000 Project.  You commented on Mr Jefferson's letter that you would=
=20
consider meeting with him.  I can be of assistance in coordinating a meeting=
=20
between the two of you.   Please advise.

FYI - Mr. Jefferson had a difficult time reaching me because my phone number=
=20
changed when my office moved to 3AC.

Calvin,

I just wish to report that starting tomorrow JEFFERSON will supply the third
person to Compaq in support of the Enron Windows 2000 project.  I called you
almost everyday when we were not getting a response, so it is only fair that
you also share in the good news.  Also, thank you for all your support in
making this occasion possible.

You are a good man!

Please stay in touch.

Limas
