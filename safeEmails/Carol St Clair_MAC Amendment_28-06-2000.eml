Luanne:
Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC=20
would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's ratin=
g=20
from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit=20
Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in=20
Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the=20
reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if=20
there are any problems with the above.

Tana,
Please draft an amendment for my review.
