Also, remind me to give you my tax return info.  Noel forwarded it to me

traveler's checks and $197 in pounds to start off.  I also plan on getting
about $100 in US dollars before I go.  I'll start packing Wednesday afternoo=

to make sure I don't forget anything.  If you think of anything important fo=
r
me (besides umbrellas and toothbrush), please let me know asap.  I would als=
o
appreciate a receipt notification from this e-mail, as it contains very
important information.  Haha, do I sound official enough?  Tell Ann Ducharms

that's about it.  Talk to you later!

All the very best,
Jules
