Hi Vince,

Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go=20
to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would=20
overlap with Ben's visit in November and so some alternative arrangement=20
would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there=20
will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until=20
early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so=20
then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

OUT: Sat 21st October
RETURN: Saturday 16th December

Regards,

Anjam
