Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titani=
um
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

Melissa (703-561-6408)
