FYI, after she spoke with Brian Vass ( who was involved in the May 2000=20
Catalytica/ENA Spark Spread Derivative repurchase transaction), Hope Vargas=20
called to inquire about documentation terminating the Spark Spread Derivativ=
e=20
that was originally part of the December 1999 Catalytica transaction. Hope=20
said she needed the documentation in connection with the evaluation of that=20
Derivative for inclusion in Raptor. I explained that the option under=20
consideration for inclusion in Raptor was unrelated to this now- terminated=20
Spark Spread Derivative, and instead the proper option for consideration is =
a=20
preferred stock purchase option acquired by Enron Ventures in a 1997=20
transaction with Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( now held by Sundance=20
Assets L.P., see my earlier E-Mail on this subject). Hope has asked for=20
copies of all of the documentation previously delivered to Sara in connectio=
n=20
with the preferred stock purchase option, which I agreed to provide.
