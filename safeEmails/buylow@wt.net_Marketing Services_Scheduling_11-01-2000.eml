Daren,

Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling=
=20
the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a=20
strong case could be made in favor of that idea.

It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing,=
=20
nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge=20
base and the responsibility factor. It is a "Who's on First" issue.

If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of marke=
t=20
intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the=20
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and=20
POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services=20
immensely.

As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and=
=20
more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes=
=20
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.

I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to=20
handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to=20
think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the onl=
y=20
person that should be involved in the Industrials.

I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you=20
and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat=20
that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite=20
alright.

Once again, thanks for listening.

Ken
