All,=20

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the ma=
trix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only on=
e name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if =
the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - onl=
y person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly re=
sponsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed pro=

usiness sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward=
 basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address=
 any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that=
 they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names=
