Subject:	Changes at EBS

Date:		July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications ind=
ustry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ag=
o has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains co=
mmitted to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly res=
pond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusti=
ng the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means t=
hat we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercia=
l efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will =
involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those u=
nits within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs=
 of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group,=
 led by Stewart Seeligson. =20
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul R=
acicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management =
perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the C=
hairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mos=
t effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be=
 advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by =
July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeploymen=
t, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked o=
ut all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you=
 of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.
