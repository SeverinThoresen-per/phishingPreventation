I spoke with Wayne Mays - he spoke with Coleman and Virgo and confirmed my u=
nderstanding:  Wayne's RC has the following people:

Portland:
Bill Williams - Development
Mark Mullen - Development
Larry Soderquist - Transmission
Stan Gray - Transmission
Don Hamond - Transmission
Jodi Blackburn - Contracts
Patty Deas - Admin

Houston:
Walter Koffer - Transmission

Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because=
:
- the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
- West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 =
people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-y=
ear.=20

This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski alr=
eady left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west=
 should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in t=
he east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I =
intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.
