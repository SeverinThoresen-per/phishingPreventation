As per our discussion of last Friday, I wanted to follow-up with examples of=
=20
what
concept I was trying to convey.  I have seen in some Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.=
=20
physical
confirmations that they use the following wording to incorporate the General=
=20
Terms &
Conditions which have been sent by certified mail to the Counterparty:

Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.'s Sales, Purchase and/or Exchange Agreement=20
General Terms and Conditions revised October, 1998, (a copy shall be
furnished upon Buyer's request), are incorporated herein by this reference=20
for all purposes.=20

or

The following terms (also referred to as the "Special Terms and Conditions")=
=20
and=20
ELFI's General Terms and Conditions dated March 01, 1996 ("General Terms and=
=20
Conditions"), which Buyer acknowledges it has received, together constitute=20
all of=20
the terms of the binding agreement between the parties regarding this=20
transaction=20
(this "Agreement").=20

I am hopeful that we might employ the same concept to the General Terms &=20
Conditions
for transactions completed via EnronOnline.  The General Terms & Conditions=20
we=20
currently attach to EOL deals is agreed to by each Counterparty online and=20
the Counterparty=20
can view the GTC's online, if necessary.

The emphasis behind the above request is, of course, and effort to reduce th=
e=20
amount of=20
paper that we are faxing to Counterparties.  I cannot quantify the amount of=
=20
fax time this would
save, but considering that the GTC's generally double the pages faxed to a=20
Counterparty, it
am be significant. =20

I would be happy to discuss this further with you. =20
