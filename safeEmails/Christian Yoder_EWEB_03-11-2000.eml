Christian, these guys have their act pretty well together.  I spoke with Bur=
t=20
Dunn (his boss was also listening over Burt's shoulder and helping to confir=
m=20
information).

Recently their Board approved a "general plan" of the transaction=20
contemplated.   They did not do formal Board action in the form of a specifi=
c=20
resolution, but I think the general approval will likely prove to be=20
sufficient.

Here is what they are sending me:

1.  a copy of the "general plan" so that we can confirm just what the Board=20
saw and what, if anything, might be seriously missing.

2.  a letter confirming the Board vote approving the "general plan."

3.  a copy of the resolution adopted by the Board several years ago exemptin=
g=20
power purchase contracts from public bidding requirements.

4.  material from their Risk Management manual detailing the approval and=20
individual authority to enter into provisions with regard to specific types=20
of power contracts.

I asked Burt to fax these.  It may take a little while to pull it all=20
together, but I expect to see it no later than early tomorrow morning.

Let me know if there is anything else on EWEB.

I just left a voicemail for Tom Grim re: Clatskanie.  I will continue to=20
follow-up call him until I get a specific answer to your questions.  I=20
acknowledge your 3 this afternoon deadline.

More when its available
