	Mike and John, let's discuss?  I may have led Vernon astray?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, see Mike's comment I highlighted in red below.  I thought you said no =
new paths are allowed on the 8:00 AM (which is what I told Virginia Power) -=
 who is right?

Mike,

Vernon has been talking to Virginia Power about their IDD agreement, and que=
stions arose about the 8 a.m. true up process, SBS, etc.

Vernon explained to them that they must at least have a zero nom path in pla=
ce in order to be able to true up at the final 8 a.m. process.  I told him t=
hat we like to encourage shippers to at least nom as closely as possible to =
their actual anticipated takes, but that a nomination of zero does count as =
having an existing path for true up purposes.  Would our preference be a zer=
o nom path over a circular nom?  I told him that I believe we hate to encour=
age either of these, but if the customer chooses to do one or the other, whi=
ch is the least harmful to us?
[Bodnar, Michael]  First let me clarify...zero nominations are no longer req=
uired for 8 a.m. true-up. You are correct we don't encourage any nominations=
 that merely serve as placeholders. Our preference is to nominate based on b=
est estimate of requirements.=20
True-up nominations should not be too significant a number, but should be mo=
re of a refinement to minimize out of balance activity. At least that should=
 be the goal...now I know sometimes the true-up nom is quite significant, bu=
t hopefully those are exceptions rather than the rule.=20
Because the 8 a.m. true-up is a very onerous, manual process that must be co=
mpleted in a very limited period of time, all parties to the transaction inc=
luding upstream and downstream parties, and operators must approve the chang=
e, before the true-up is scheduled. In addition the change must have approva=
l from NNG Gas Control. New paths are allowed but this becomes a more diffic=
ult task if number of parties are needed to approve the change.

If we are in an allocation mode, but we don't allocate the timely process an=
d SBS kicks in, what happens if we allocate subsequent processes?  Does the =
SBS that was scheduled in the timely process hold, or will it be cut in the =
next process when a storage allocation occurs?
[Bodnar, Michael]  The activity should hold during subsequent allocation....=
unless bumped during one of the bump cycles. There is a slight possibility t=
hat the activity will be considered incremental but that possibiltly is mini=
mized if there are no changes to the scheduled path. =20

I always trip over my own feet when these questions come up.  Can you please=
 set me straight once again?

Thanks,

Kay
