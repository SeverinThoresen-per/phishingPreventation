I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think=
=20
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example,=20
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk=20
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in thei=
r=20
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to=20
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are=20
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up=20
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs i=
s=20
working).

Thanks.
