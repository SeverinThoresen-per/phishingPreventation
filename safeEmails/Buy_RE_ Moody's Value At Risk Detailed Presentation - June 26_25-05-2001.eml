Heard back from Tim. Please plan on attending. Port, Bradford, you and I wil=
l attend from RAC. Moody's is having trouble with our loss of $694MM that I =
told them when they were here. We need to start pulling together explicitly =
why we lost so much in one day, what the var limits were that day and what h=
as been the experience since then. Tx Rick

Rick,
I have no problem making the trip.  I will leave it to you to consider the r=
esources necessary to give the pitch.  I don't think there is much else that=
 as important.  I have just finished reading the book 'When Genius Failed' a=
bout LTCM and, at the end of the day, funding positions through turmoil is a=
lmost more important than being right in the first place.  FYI, I will be in=
 Houston on 6/21 for the prc. Originally planned to leave on 6/22.  Could st=
ay through weekend and fly back to London thru NY.
Let me know
Ted
