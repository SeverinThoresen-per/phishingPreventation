Greg-The Power Fundamentals applications are owned by Enron and, along with =
all the other Enron developed software, will be licensed to UBS on an exclus=
ive basis for use in the North American Power and Gas business.  UBS will th=
en sublicense these applications back to Enron for use by Enron within the p=
ermitted "Enron Field of Use".  The Enron Field of Use is described in Secti=
on 7.1 of the Comprehensive License Agreement and includes all the activitie=
s that Enron is allowed to pursue within the North American Power and Gas bu=
siness. =20

Further more, under the Comprehensive License Agreement, Enron is required t=
o maintain and protect any Trade Secrets relating to the Gas and Power Busin=
ess and to the proprietary software developed by Enron.  See Section 16.9 to=
 the Comprehensive License Agreement.=20

Give me your opinion on Tim Belden's issue below please. =20

Schedule 27.4 lists power fundamentals applications and the CLA says that th=
e Enron Parties are licensing it to UBS.  I also talked with Bob Hillier on =
this and he agreed with me and said that the Enron Parties own everything an=
d the schedule lists what we are licensing to UBS.  West Power Fundamentals =
was developed by the Enron Parties and is owned by the Enron Parties.

Let me know your thoughts.

GP

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished=
 together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enr=
on needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I=
 have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information con=
fidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard=
 could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with A=
EP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richa=
rd's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our inter=
ests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  =
The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use withi=
n the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your coopera=
tion is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger =
will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth=20
