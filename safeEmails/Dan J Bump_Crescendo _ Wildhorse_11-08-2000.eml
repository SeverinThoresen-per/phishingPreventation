The Wildhorse Operating Team met yesterday (Thursday 08/10) and I was=20
informed this morning that Wildhorse has decided to present us a formal=20
proposal to gather Crescendo's Entrada gas from San Arroyo.  Wildhorse told=20
me to expect the proposal by Friday 08/18; I'll continue to monitor next wee=
k=20
to ensure they do not delay any further.

The nature of the project would be similar to what Wildhorse discussed with=20
NG Resources in the past...Wildhorse will construct certain pipeline segment=
s=20
in order to isolate a seperate low Btu gathering line from San Arroyo to=20
Crescendo's proposed plant location at Badger Wash. =20

Obviously, when Ken (or myself) receives the proposal, a group meeting would=
=20
be very beneficial as I'm sure there will be numerous questions/issues for u=
s=20
to contemplate.....gathering capacity, structure, contract issues, plant=20
issues, etc.

Talk to everyone at the Tues. meeting.

Dan
