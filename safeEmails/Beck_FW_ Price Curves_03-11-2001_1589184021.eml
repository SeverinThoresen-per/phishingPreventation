Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern=
 Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital=
 and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at=
 that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk managemen=
t purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like=
 the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Conf=
identiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any o=
ther companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in iden=
tifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks
