George,
 I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special=20
Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.  I would suggest the=20
following language be inserted in each applicable Transaction Confirmation.

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained in the=20
sentences previously added to the end of Section 13.5, the parties agree tha=
t=20
the price to be applicable with regard to any volumes outside of the +/-10%=20
tolerance shall be the Gas Daily "Daily Mid-point" price for the day=20
following the day that the parties discover the existence of volumes outside=
=20
of the +/-10% tolerance."
