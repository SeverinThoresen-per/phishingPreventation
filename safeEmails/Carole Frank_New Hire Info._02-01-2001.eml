background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance=20
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects=
=20
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a=20

to dealing with all levels of personnel."

She should be sending me his resume soon. =20
