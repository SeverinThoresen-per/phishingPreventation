STOCKWATCH Enron higher after Merrill Lynch's cautious upgrade to 'buy'

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were higher in morning trade after Mer=
rill Lynch issued a cautiously optimistic note upgrading the stock to 'buy' =
from 'accumulate' following Enron's sale of certain US and Indian assets, de=
alers said. At 11.35 am, Enron gained 36 cents, or 1.08 pct, to 33.81 usd.=20
The Dow Jones Utility Average (DUX) declined 4.26 points to 316.05.=20
On the broader indices, DJIA lost 16.26 points to 9,051.68, the S&P=20
500 fell 3.50 to 1,058.90, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 23.21
points lower to 1,583.53.=20

In a note issued early this morning, Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey sai=
d, the agreement to sell Portland General and its India oil and gas interest=
, has positioned the company to focus on its more profitable core businesses=
, while substantially reducing its debt load by the end of 2002.
The sale of Portland General is expected to add 1.88 bln usd of cash to the =
company coffers at the close of the transaction fourth-quarter of 2002. The =
deal will also bring 1.1 bln usd of debt relief.=20
Meanwhile, the sale of Indian oil and gas assets should bring in 388 mln usd=
=2E=20
Eassey expects more asset sales by the company in the near future.=20
The divestiture of the troubled Dabhol power facility in India along with sm=
aller international gas assets could provide the company with additional liq=
uidity, he said.=20
"Enron could ultimately (in the next 3 years) raise another 1.8 bln usd or s=
o from Dabhol and other non-core international assets."=20
The Dabhol plant is 65 pct owned by Enron, making it the biggest investment =
in India by a non-Indian company.=20
The company's partner, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), owns 15 p=
ct. MSEB owes Enron 48 mln usd for past power bills, but claims the power is=
 too expensive and says it cannot absorb it all. The plant has lied idle sin=
ce.=20
Many questions, however, remain unanswered, said Eassey, noting that despite=
 the upgrade he is remaining cautious.=20
"While Enron has a menu of assets to draw upon to raise capital, reduce debt=
 and improve its earnings prospects in the process, the primary question cen=
tres on timing," he said.=20
"Will the asset sales line up with an expected balance sheet clean up (with =
prospective gains offsetting losses)?=20
"Can Enron sell its interest in Dabhol anytime soon, given the current war e=
nvironment?=20
"What impact will the weakening economies of South America such as Brazil an=
d Argentina, not too mention the negative economic sentiment here in the US,=
 have on Enron's and other internationally diverse companies' earnings outlo=
ok?"=20
These issues, along with the earnings drag from about 967 mln usd invested i=
n its broadband unit and the viability of its 3.5 bln usd of goodwill, will =
likely continue to weigh on the stock near-term, explained Eassey.=20
Reflecting the above uncertainties, Eassey said he is "cautiously lightening=
" his 3-year growth outlook from the 20 pct range to 16-17 pct a year. Earni=
ngs per share estimates for 2001 stand at 2.10 usd, while the 2003 forecast =
is 2.45 usd.=20
Accordingly, Eassey's 'long-term' price objective now stands at 44 usd, or 3=
1 pct above its current price with an upgrade on the shares to buy from accu=
mulate.=20

Power providers cry foul over fees / State is accused of improper billing

Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy marke=
t are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager i=
s forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray D=
avis' administration.=20
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally=
 required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping sta=
te power buyers spread out the cost of high- priced electricity contracts.
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about myst=
erious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney-Jone=
s of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such ind=
ustry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant.=20
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resource=
s was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an aver=
age of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour.=20
"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water=
 Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said.=20
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a=
 formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could o=
rder the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been imp=
roperly charged.=20
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid ma=
nagement agency.=20
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared Cali=
fornia could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the st=
ate had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market=
 suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought.=20
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said th=
e grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing prac=
tices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the acco=
unts of other generators.=20
"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control =
the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said.=20
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusation=
s "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentimen=
t in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs.=20
"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in =
Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a =
surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."=20
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said gener=
ators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis.=
=20
"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a=
 year."=20
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a respons=
e to the accusations.=20
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mech=
anisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs.=20
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operati=
ng costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said.=20
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resa=
le, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expen=
sive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand=
-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the I=
SO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost.=
=20
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In =
January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chai=
red by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry.=
 Davis appointed his own five-member board.=20
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a=
 political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California =
to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization.=20
Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.

Enron Corp. Raised to Long-Term `Buy' at Merrill

Northwest to Buy Portland General
CBS MarketWatch.com
10/8/2001 7:44:00 PM=20
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 08, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- Northwest Natural Gas=
 Co. is buying another Oregon utility from Enron Corp. for $1.8 billion, com=
bining the state's largest natural gas and electric utilities in a merger th=
at may save ratepayers money but could also bring some job losses.
Richard G. "Dick" Reiten, chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural, said Monday=
 the gas company is buying Portland General Electric Co. after the Houston-b=
ased energy giant gave up on its expansion into the Pacific Northwest.
"We're extremely pleased that the acquisition will return PGE to local owner=
ship," Reiten said at a news conference.
Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said he was con=
cerned the combination could encourage Northwest Natural to bypass state reg=
ulators by using its business clout to lobby the Legislature and governor's =
office when rate increases are needed.
"If that's going to happen, and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legisla=
ture and the governor's office, then I don't think that's going to be in the=
 interest of PGE customers," Jenks said.
Northwest Natural was founded in 1859, the year Oregon became a state, using=
 gas extracted from coal to light downtown street lamps.
PGE was founded in 1889 with a hydroelectric generator at Willamette Falls t=
hat anchored the nation's first long-distance electric transmission line whe=
n it was connected to the city, 14 miles to the north. The plant still opera=
tes, generating 16 megawatts of electricity.
Reiten said the Northwest Natural board of directors has rejected buyout off=
ers itself in recent years in hopes that an opportunity like the PGE deal wo=
uld come along.
"It was a conscious choice to remain independent and build assets rather tha=
n sell out of state," Reiten said. "That patience has paid off."
He said the deal will create a $5 billion utility that can cut costs by comb=
ining repair crews, equipment, service centers and billing in their overlapp=
ing service area.
Portland General has about 733,000 customers in northwestern Oregon and Nort=
hwest Natural has about 530,000 customers in roughly the same area, includin=
g some in southwestern Washington state. Their headquarters are just a few b=
locks apart on the same downtown street.
Federal and state regulatory approval, along with shareholder approval, is e=
xpected to take about a year.
Some job cuts were expected, but Reiten said he hoped most would come throug=
h attrition and retirement, rather than layoffs.
He said regulators have looked favorably on recent mergers of gas and electr=
ic utilities because they generally have saved money for ratepayers. Combine=
d utilities already serve about two thirds of the nation, he added.
Enron purchased PGE in 1997 for about $3.2 billion, including assumption of =
debt, hoping to tap into energy trading along the entire West Coast, from Ca=
lifornia to Washington state. But the Texas company found the pace of deregu=
lation in Oregon too slow at a time when the California energy crisis was un=
folding.
Enron has a history of buying and selling smaller companies as it searches f=
or the best position in the constantly shifting energy market, said Mike Hei=
m, an A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst who follows the Texas company.
"It's really more a strategic move," Heim said.
Enron will receive $1.55 billion cash and $350 million in securities for PGE=
=2E
Enron stock closed at $33.45 on Monday, up $1.72 per share. Northwest Natura=
l was at $22.99, down 42 cents a share.
