The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OA=
SIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.  I wanted to let all of you kno=
w a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ens=
ure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The=
 MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to ge=
t our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logi=
ns to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nic=
olay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it ar=
rives.=20

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things close=
r and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple =
weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, w=
e will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, t=
here should be only one login set up for "EPMI 24-Hour Operations," with a l=
ogin of "Enron."  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but shou=
ld be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  Thi=
s final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contr=
actual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal=
, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the f=
inal documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of ti=
me to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have c=
ome to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final=
 application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) =
or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X3=
7007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.=20
