I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and=
 the volumes for the following;

Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment
1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved
1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved
1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Si=
tara per notes from Sylvia Pollan.
1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the l=
ong term contract.

I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believ=
e I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on th=
e wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have ac=
cess to them either. GRRRR.

Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) fro=
m $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals show=
n above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.
