Rudy-
Per our conversation today, the invoice for the "Hilli" delivery will be due=
=20
no earlier than May 17,  2001.  If under normal payment terms the invoice=20
would be due later than May 17, then the regular due date would prevail.

Thanks for your help,
Dan Masters

I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the=20
"Hilli" be extended.  Since the delivery is earlier than Eco needs the=20
product,  they would request that the invoice be due on May 17.  Please=20
advise if this is agreeable.

Thanks,
Dan Masters
