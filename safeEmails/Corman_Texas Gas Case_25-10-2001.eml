	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                               =20
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                               =20
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
