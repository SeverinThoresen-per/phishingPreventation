Per Paulette Hauer at CALP/GELP, the bill for the OPT60 goes to her. =20
CALP/GELP then invoices ENA.

We now have paper for CALP (Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership) and=20
GELP?? (Gordonsville Energy, L.P.).  I believe what I have is the original=20
contract between CES and these 2 counterparties and the "consent to waive th=
e=20
confidentiality" letter.  I don't see anything that looks like an assignment=
=20
of the contract to ENA.  Robin and I discovered today that ENA will be=20
responsible for negotiating the transport agreement on behalf of CALP for th=
e=20
next year starting 7/8/2000.

Also, neither counterparty appears to have been set up in Sitara.  Do these=20
counterparties need to be set up in Sitara?

Mr. Mills, all I care about at this point is getting the CALP transport=20
contract set up in Sitara.  Joan Veselack will get Scott Goodell to find out=
=20
exactly who receives the bills on this 40,000/day OPT-60 transport=20
agreement.  Scott will forward that information to you and everyone else on=20
this email.  I welcome your suggestions.

Paper:  I made copies for Robin Barbe, Stephanie Sever, and Sylvia Campos. =20
Sylvia, I left your copies with Brenda Fletcher - I don't know where you sit=
=2E
