Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together somepl=
ace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or an=
ything else that you want to cook, including desserts.=20

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when=
 you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is b=
ringing the main dish, salads, and desserts.=20

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cul=
tural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika
