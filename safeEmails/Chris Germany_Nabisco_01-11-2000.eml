I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on=20
CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a=20
navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and h=
e=20
has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle=20
this for him.
