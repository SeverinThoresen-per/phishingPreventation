Anjam and Kirstee,


As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. Th=
e=20
first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver=
=20
prices, the second column is your VAR with 7/19 position and dummy=20
gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19=20
position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of=20
numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page. Please refer to=20
MODELVAR2000.xls that I have sent you for gold & silver prices and=20
volatilities.=20

Thank you,
Cantekin
