In addition to the summary below, the agenda has the West-wide cap case on t=
he agenda.


FERC has posted its agenda.  It is available at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\CA\CA121901.000.TXT.

Here comes the Federal Regulatory Santa Claus?  FERC's agenda for its 12/19
meeting is incredibly ambitious and appears to have queued up a large swath
of high profile cases.  To speculate based upon the current, end-of-the-year
agenda, it appears that there will be orders regarding RTOs at center stage,
with a twist of congestion mitigation thrown in (?).  Interconnection issues
also come up, including the CA dockets.  There's also an order coming in the
California docket, but its not that clear whether this addresses the gross
load issue, outage coordination, the must-offer requirement, or some other
facet of the "market mitigation" docket.  RMR contract updates and the
various protests also come up for consideration.
