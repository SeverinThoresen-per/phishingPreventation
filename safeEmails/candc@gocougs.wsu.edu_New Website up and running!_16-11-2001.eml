Hello! There are so many people I'd like to spend hours and hours
writing to and updating on all that I've been doing lately. As we all
know, that'll be very slow and coming! So - in the meantime - check out
my new and improved website! www.simplifiedliving.org I'd love comments
and feedback....as well as any referrals you feel like sending my way!
:)

Carl and I are doing great here...house is good, dogs are good and
pregancy is going just fine! Baby is due in April so we'll keep you
posted...we're letting the boy/girl part be a surprise!

Hope you are doing well and that the holiday season will be full of love
and happiness for you!

warmly,
chrissy
