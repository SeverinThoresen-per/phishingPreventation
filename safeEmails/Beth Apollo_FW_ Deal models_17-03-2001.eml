Beth,

The information we need to complete the analysis is included in the document=

we outlined this morning. Fred and Rahil are working on getting volumes for=20
your group to estimate the marginal cost per transaction at different volume=

levels. We will use that information to estimate the cost side going forward=

On the revenue side I believe that it can be misleading to use a cost plus=20
approach and that we will be better off estimating the price counterparties=20
are willing to pay for the service based on market comparables from the=20
benchmarking studies Sally contracted a while ago. We will also take into=20
account for pricing other variables as the contingent liability risks that=20
they are avoiding by outsourcing their back office function and the issue of=

information confidentiality.

Thanks   for the note -- that helps to put it into perspective. =20
Unfortunately, since Sally is out this week, I had not seen this note.

Here is the message I received from Greg, which I just told you and Rahil=20
about today.=20

I would really like to use Rahil's expertise at EOL to try to size the=20

feedback about the marginal per transaction cost at different volume levels=20
as presented in the document we discussed this morning. I will be available=20
to help in any way needed.

Thanks in advance for your help
