Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we w=
ould like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT te=
am to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a mi=
nimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more develop=
ment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operational ca=
pacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to access the=
 operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David also h=
as been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity fundame=
ntals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built and maintai=
ns the current message board system used by gas trading and as well as the c=
ritical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely with the We=
st desk and Portland on various real time load and outage reports.  David Dr=
onet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will allow the fun=
damentals team to continue producing innovative products instead of providin=
g only support for current operations.  Let me know if you have any question=
s.

Chris=20
