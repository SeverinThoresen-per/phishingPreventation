Mr. Hyvl,

Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until
we have a fully executed contract, so it looks like I will have to take that
portion out of the contract.

Christian,
     Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.
Please print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the
purchase order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If
the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring
the number from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed
copies to me or Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.
(See attached file: CITYPublicServiceSanAntonio.doc)

                    Christian W."         To:     "'Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com'"

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.
