Per our conversation -  on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg=
=2E and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 centra=
l desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East w=
ill record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas wer=
e done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for e=
ach of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not have =
the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of accounti=
ng at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have i=
n the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of=
 the UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going to profi=
t center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant ch=
anges to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower lev=
el of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at the different=
 profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing their an=
alysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in the meeting =
that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion that we al=
l need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organizatio=
n - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will need to be =
able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisions were made in o=
ur meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain unchanged for=
 this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss further.  Thanks!
