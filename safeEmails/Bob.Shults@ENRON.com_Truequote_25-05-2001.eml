Please give Chris Edmonds a call.  He is calmed down now concerning the pote=
ntial launch on 6/4. He is not threatening with Broker client. They are stil=
l moving ahead on that.  I told Chris you would call to check up on things i=
ncluding the status of broker client.  Just goodwill call.  Thanks

Have you called the Nymex?

40 trades on broker client today -  100 by quarter end.

Can I call Joe Robertson (NYMEX metals) or do I need to talk to you first?
