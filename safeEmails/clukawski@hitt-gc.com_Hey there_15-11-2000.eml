Ben,

How was the wedding? Homecoming was pretty lame.  I hung out with people
that live in DC, Stanton, etc.  I did see Dave Crocini and Melanie and Kerry
and her husband.  JV did make it down, we got pretty smashed and went to Old
Glory or course.

Ken and Theo were in town this past weekend.  We all went out for dinner
with the Penney's and their new baby. Scary to see JP holding a baby.

How is Texas? I'm sick of the election thing, what's the attitude down
there.
