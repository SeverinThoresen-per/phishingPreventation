I personally don't want the 10th, we are supposed to leave for vacation on=20
the 11th of August.  Do you think having the meetings on the 8th and 9th=20
would be a problem for those attending the WSPP meeting.  Perhaps, we could=20
do the Collateral Annex meeting on 9th if Drafting Committee members=20
attending the WSPP meeting need to travel that day.

Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but
Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on
August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again
Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well.
And as always thanks for your help.
