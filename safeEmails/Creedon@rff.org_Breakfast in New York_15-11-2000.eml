On Feb. 27, 2001 RFF Board member Dod Fraser will host a breakfast in New
York to introduce us to potential donors (corporate, foundation and
individual) and Board members in the area.  If you have names of people you
would like to invite to this event, please send them to me (with contact
information) at your earliest convenience.  We appreciate your assistance in
helping us expand our circle of friends.  I look forward to hearing from
you!
