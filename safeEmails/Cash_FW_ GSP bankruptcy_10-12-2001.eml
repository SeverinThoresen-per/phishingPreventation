I don't think so because they roll up under EIM and I don't think they were =

 Diane may have included them in the second pass at that data.

For purposes of determining the Garden State Paper (GSP) first day motions t=
o be filed, the attorney at Weil I am working with (Chris Marcus) has asked =
whether GSP employees were included in the "count" of "Enron" employees to b=
e covered under its motion for approval to pay payroll.  If you have any que=
stions, please email or call me.  Thanks
