Leslie, I am not sure of who is handling this from the accounting side and w=
ho is the commercial expert on the "cash out protocol, but by copying this l=
etter to Jim, I am requesting that he determine who is the commercial point =
person. Gerald and I can work together to determine whether the legal provis=
ions of the cash out agreements are adequate as between third parties and En=
ron......concerns  have also been expressed by Brian Redmond about whether A=
EP will only try to settle those cash out situations where Enron is the obli=
gor as opposed to both sides of the equation. I request that Jim set up a me=
eting with the appropriate persons and distribute the cash out protocol for =
discussion of the "larger picture on cash out management".

Best regards bng

AEP/HPL forwarded to our attention cash out letters to resolve third party i=
mbalances that were incurred when HPL was a subsidiary of Enron Corp.  My su=
pervisor, Rita Wynne, asked that I forward the letters to Gerald Nemec for h=
is review, but he is unfamiliar with the AEP/Enron settlement and said it mi=
ght be better for you to review them to make sure the language agrees with t=
he settlement.  May I forward these to you?

Regards,

Leslie Robinson
