	I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.

	There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an=
 assumption
	everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was s=
till a lot
	of vacation to be taken.

	I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at =
2:00
	to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year.  We can meet in my =
office.

	Thanks. Lynn
