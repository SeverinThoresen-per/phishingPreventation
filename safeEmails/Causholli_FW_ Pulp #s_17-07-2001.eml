Here's note that just came from Merrill on last Wednesday's Pulp numbers...I=

Grim Pulp Outlook The situation in the pulp market is grim. Here are our com=
ments on last week's statistics. A pick up in prices before next year is get=
ting slimmer by the day.=20
Last Wednesday, the Norscan pulp producer inventories came out, showing a de=
cline of 84,000, compared to the 10 year average of 65,000 tons. The differe=
nce is immaterial, but it is impressive that the stocks fell at all because =
of the very low operating rates in the European fine pape rmarket, the key m=
arket for chamical pulp sold in the open market. With Nordic operating rates=
 for June believed to have been lower than 70%, there was a much lower than =
normal pulp consumption. We may make one important observation, however. May=
be the smaller fine paper producers, all non-integrated, has continued to op=
erate at 100%, and this may explain why Norscan stocks fell. Then the next q=
uestion is: how long are the Nordic producers, and Sappi, going to be willin=
g to give away customers to the price cutters? M-real, and yesterday Stora E=
nso, has announced HIGHER fine paper prices. This is just surreal. Keeping p=
rices relative stable is a phenomenal achievement in it self, and if they ma=
nage, there will be a dramatic multiple expansion over the next year.=20
Europulp, the pulp kept in European harbours, fell by 67,000 tons in June, t=
o 1.36 million tons. This is the second highest figure during the 2 1/2 year=
s this statisitic has been collected, and brings us back to the April level.=
 A year ago, the level was 765,000 tons, and the stocks kept within a band o=
f 600,000 and 900,000 from the start of 1999 (when our information starts) t=
o November last year. So, in one way, this is good news, but we believe the =
stocks are still much too high. The little history we have show a small decl=
ine in June, but 2001 was better than the average. The Europulp stocks are o=
wned by pulp producers (of which some is included in Norscan), traders (very=
 little) and buyer (almost all of this would be included in Utipulp). We hav=
e to wait a few days for the Utipulp figures, but there is a small increase,=
 historically, of 4,000 tons in June. The fact that the Norscan stocks fell =
17,000 more than the Europulp figures suggest that the Utipulp stocks would =
have increased this year, too.=20
Another reason for the declining Norscan figure may be found in Aracruz's 2Q=
 figure. Thomas Souza, our South American colleauge, reports that Aracruz dr=
amatically increased its sale to Asia. The reason was that the Chinese start=
ed buying pulp again in March/April. If they bought more eucalyptus pulp fro=
m Brazil, they would most likely also have bought a lot more softwood pulp f=
rom Canada and the US. Thus, Norscan shipment rates would most likely have b=
een high, despite of the low fine paper production in Europe. The important =
point the Norscan figure is that the stocks still are way above 1.5 million =
tons level, where the inventories typically have to fall to in order to crea=
te pricing power for the producers. The stocks have fallen 225,000 since the=
 seasonal peak in February, compared to a drop of 338,000 tons during the la=
st 10 years. So, this was a bad spring. July and August typically see a seas=
onal increase in stocks, 230,000 on average over the last 10 years. There is=
 no reason to believe that it will not increase this summer, too. As a matte=
r of fact, there is a seasonal increase of 377,000 (implying a 29,000 per ye=
ar increase in the stocks) tons in the Norscan stocks from June to February.
 The price is now very close to the cash cost for the high cost producers, a=
nd it is just a question of time before we get announcements of indefinite p=
ulp mill closures. Then it's time to buy. However, we are starting to think =
that the pulp market may not recover before the start of next year. Not sinc=
e 1978 have there been a recovery in the pulp price during the second half o=
f the year, and at that time it started in 3Q ( In think all would agree tha=
t the possibility for a 3Q recovery is small), not Q4. Thus, every recovery =
in the pulp price during the last 23 years has either started in 1Q, or more=
 often in 2Q.=20
