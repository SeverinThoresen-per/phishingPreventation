=20
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward=20
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every=20

Here's a recap for everyone. =20
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was i=
n=20
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear. =20
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we=20
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up=20
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points=
=20
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and=20
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and=20
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we=20
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The=20
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from=20
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE=20
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the=20
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the=
=20
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to=20
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said=20
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you hav=
e=20
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the=20
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this=20
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom
