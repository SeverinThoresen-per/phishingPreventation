We need to discuss in our Tuesday Call.

1) Who is the intended audience of these points? NERC? or outside NERC about=
 NERC?  The message has to be tailored to the audience.

There are people in various places DOE, NERC, NIPC, some utilities, that fee=
l empowered by the events. We do not want to belittle their concerns, we wan=
t to expose them to ridicule when they do not use their brain,

NERC is still the only game in town, We need to guide them to be truly impar=
tial in the electric utility restructuring, but also be ready to expose the =
abuse of their Information monopoly position.

Do we work from within? or launch our missiles to attack their standing?

What is the role of the MIC in regards to this issue within NERC?


2) Central Repository of Data. I wanted to discuss this point to determine i=
f we should lobby to strengthen this system or let it die through neglect?. =
The key is that the institution that hold access to this information has pow=
er.

3) Actions with DOE. The one that was more concerning to me, is the perspect=
ive of some coordinators to "play it conservatively"; I interpret it as, ref=
using to schedule some market transactions.

4) RTOs. Tome Bowe of PJM blasted the NERC staff  at the meeting when he got=
 hold of the Energy Daily article.

Charles,

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable=
/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security =
risk, and added some stronger "chastisement" words at the end.  They may be =
too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, =
is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approa=
ch is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness wo=
uld be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by l=
ooking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and sh=
rugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look li=
ke we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given t=
he esoteric nature of some of our points.

Thoughts?
