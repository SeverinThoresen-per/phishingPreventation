I have posted your grades on the class web page under grades.

As you will see, as a whole, you did very well. This was great to see ---
congratulations to you all!!!  The exam was definitely on the hard side, yet
the median score was still very high.  As usual in cases such as these I
will take all the credit!!!

--- Jonathan
