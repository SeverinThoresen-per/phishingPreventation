Stacey:

I received your name from David Oliver in London, who mentioned that you may=
 be able to answer questions for me regarding how we handle tolling for powe=
r in relation to order handling.    I am a business analyst working with EIM=
 on the Logistics project.

I would like to ask some questions on this to understand how my team might r=
elate it to the steel industry for EIM.

Let me know if this time will work for you.  If not, I can reschedule.

Thanks,
Angela
