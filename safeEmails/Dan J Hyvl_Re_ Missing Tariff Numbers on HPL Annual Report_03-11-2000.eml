It is my understanding that cashouts coming from Unify look like regular=20
sales and purchases.  The accounts used are as follows:

TYPE                                                                ACCOUNT

Cashout Sale - Third Party                             483
Cashout Sale - Intercompany                       484
Cashout Purchase - Third Party                   803
Cashout Purchase - Intercompany              803?

This is how the FERC module in SAP is mapping them.

Rita/Kris - let me know if my understanding of Unify is correct.

I guess the transport tariff is as good a place to refer to cashouts as=20
anywhere.  How should they be listed on the tariffs?  And what (NARUC)=20
account are cashouts booked under?

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract=20
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.=

The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings,=20
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts=20
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff,=20
