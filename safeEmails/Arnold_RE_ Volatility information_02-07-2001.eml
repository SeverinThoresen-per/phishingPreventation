	i don't have a problem with that.  The 3 factors I ask in releasing info ar=
e:

	1. Do customers even know the info is available or useful?
	2. Is the info publicly available?
	3. Is the info easily obtainable?

	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answ=
er is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.

      I am a summer analyst working with Laura Luce in the central gas desk.
      We are trying to assemble a client-based website which will be used to=
 provide assorted information material to the natrual gas industry to specif=
ically targeted Enron clients.  In so doing, we are trying to gather as much=
 information as possible without crossing lines of propriety.  One of the is=
sues which has come up recently is whether we would be allowed to post next =
month and/or year-out volatility data.  The data would be posted to a passwo=
rd protected site, but it would be on the extranet.  Chris Gaskill, who is g=
enerally our local authority on issues of propriety has suggested that this =
would ultimately be your decision.  Any comments on the propriety of exposin=
g these volatility curves would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your =
time.

Phil
