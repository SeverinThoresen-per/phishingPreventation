Hello Mr. Kenneth Lay,

I hope you don't mind an email from someone who is not very high
in the decision-making level of Enron but I have such strong need=20
to share my thoughts and visions with you.

First, I am so happy that we are not going to be acquired by Dynegy.
Enron is an entity that deserves to live on. =20

Second, I have a vision that we (Enron) become a "Wiser & Quieter" Enron.

I wish I can do something to help raise the "millions/billions" of dollars n=
eeded
to survive in the shortrun, but all I can do is continue working on my proje=
ct
as I have done before....

I personally do not mind the company shrinking to a very modest level
in the next 12-48 months, selling off core businesses, and adopting a more
cautious role to ALL spending.  Even if we are layed-off we can always=20
come back in the future.

Third, I just want to share an imagery of Enron being strong again in the fu=
ture...
Not with the previous ostentatiousness that prevailed in "the old days" but =
with=20
a newly developed sense of Wisdom and Maturity. =20
=2E..And there will be articles in the Wall Street Journal about how the Enr=
on giant=20
has slowly but consistently lifted itself out of the gutter to become a=20
"Wiser & Quieter Enron".

If there is anything I can do to help you in this endeavor please let me kno=
w.
I have no strong family obligations that prevent me from working long hours
on some additional short-term projects to help out my Enron.

Best Wishes!
