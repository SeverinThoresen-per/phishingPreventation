TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES

This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. America: The Good=20
Neighbor. =20

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable=
=20
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television=20
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as=20
printed in the Congressional Record.

The comments at the end are not mine but I agree with them wholeheartedly.

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most=20
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth. =20

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of=
=20
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and=20
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying eve=
n=20
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who=20
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the=20
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in=
=20
to help.

This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody=20
helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into=20
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about=20
the decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of those=20
countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar buil=
d=20
its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal=20
the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why=
=20
don't they fly them?  Why do all the International lines except Russia fly=20
American Planes?=20

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the=20
moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.=20

You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once=
,=20
but several times - and safely home again.=20

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store=20
window for everybody to look at.  Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued=20
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are=
=20
breaking Canadian laws, are getting America dollars from ma and pa at home t=
o=20
spend here.=20

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through=20
age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad=20
and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both=
=20
are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other=20
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to=20
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during=20
the San Francisco earthquake.=20

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired=20
of hearing them get kicked around.

They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, the=
y=20
are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their=20
present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those.=20

Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!"

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the Unite=
d=20
States. It is nice that one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of th=
e=20
world would realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never even=20
get a thank you for the things we do. I would hope that each of you would=20
send this to as many people as you can and  emphasize that they should send=20
it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on=20
the web. I am just a single American that has read this, I SURE HOPE THAT A=20
LOT MORE READ IT SOON.
