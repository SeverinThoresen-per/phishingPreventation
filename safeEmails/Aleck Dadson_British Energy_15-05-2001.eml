Rob, after extended negotiations with British Energy, we have verbally=20
settled on:

1.  Contract drop dead date extended to December 31, 2002
2.  Contract price of C$ 41.85/MWh.
3.  A number of small amendments to the contract that we (Chris and I) are O=
K=20
with (Chris is preparing an Amending Agreement and memo for Peter Keohane to=
=20
review tomorrow).

I am very happy with this as it still leaves a value of C$ 107 million (US$=20
71.3 million), and it extends the contract out 13 months from the current=20
drop dead.  They were initially at C$45/MWh so we were able to squeeze them=20
down a fair bit.  Realistically, there was a fair chance of not getting any=20
of this power as they would only have had to give Falconbridge or Dofasco or=
=20
any industrial a call and been able to fill this at $45/MWh in a heartbeat. =
=20
Fortunately they still see value in having a contract with us for the future=
=20
opportunities that may come up in the marketplace.  =20

We have left the discussion of the put swaptions from Bruce A to a later dat=
e.

Cheers, Paul D
