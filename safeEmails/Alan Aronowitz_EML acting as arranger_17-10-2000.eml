Subject: EML acting as arranger

If EML acts as an arranger in respect of certain large transactions executed=
=20
by a Metals affiliate (presumably non-EU - such as Metals New York) the=20
following tax issues arise:

1. There is a risk that EML will give the Metals affiliate a taxable presenc=
e=20
in the UK - this is exactly the same situation that we have with ECTRIC/EEFT=
=20
here we have the risk that ECTRIC will be deemed to have a UK tax presence=20
because EEFT acts as its dependent agent. We manage this risk by ensuring=20
that the commission earned by the agent adequately compensates the agent for=
=20
the functions it performs in the UK. A better understanding of who would do=20
what and where is required to formulate a view on this issue.

2. The commission earned by EML should not be subject to US tax (in addition=
=20
to UK tax) as (depending on the facts) it will probably be treated as=20
commission earned by EML in the ordinary course of its business as a=20
broker/dealer. The services performed by EML will be performed in the UK.=20
Again, need more info to conclude on this point.

3. Commissions charged by EML to the overseas affiliate should not bear UK=20
VAT.


Let me know if you need to run through the above in more detail.

Also, are you on this FX call re EOL this afternoon ? Do you have any furthe=
r=20
background to it ? I think there are some significant issues.

Regards
Janine
