Good evening,

Molly and I trained six Dynegy users this afternoon for participation in the=
 NomLogic beta program.  Currently, 'Dynegy Marketing and Trade' and 'Enron =
North America' have active business on all eight beta program pipelines. =20

We are working with the Dynegy users to complete each user's set-up.  In the=
 meantime, please prepare to use NomLogic for your communication.  Here's a =
few guidelines. . .
When:
At your convenience, your desk

Who:
Contact your Dynegy counterpart
Plan on a good time to begin to use the module (will also depend on the Dyne=
gy set-up process)

What:
Use NomLogic in the beta environment, beta.commoditylogic.com
Use your user id and password to access your pipeline and deal data
Edit deals in NomLogic for a future gas flow day
Use "real data" if known, use "fake data" (contracts, package id's, etc.) if=
 unknown

Questions/Feedback/Troubleshooting:
CommodityLogic Call Center 1-888-334-4204
Molly Sumrow 713-853-4249
Carrie Slagle 713-853-9810

Thanks for all of your help!
Carrie
