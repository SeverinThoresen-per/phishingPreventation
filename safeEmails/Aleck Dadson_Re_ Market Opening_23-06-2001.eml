With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty=20
would have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/coul=
d=20
not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The=20
question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support=20
from OPG.                                        With respect to point 2, I=20
think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's=20
/Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports ar=
e=20
delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed=20
not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel=20
comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative=20
report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being=20
negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a=20
positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the=20
OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LD=
C=20
access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems, =20
the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications=20
prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial=20
period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency=20
plan to accommodate those who are not ready.                                =

with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with=20
our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties   with=20
LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul=

the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and=20
the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with   HydroOne and the MEA in=
=20
an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's=20
discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved  and the information=

was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOn=

execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re       resource adequacy issues and=
=20
we can press this with them as well.                               - with=20
respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs=20
already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least   one CIS=20
vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per=20
David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor   to move in quickly to fil=

that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at thi=
s=20
stage.                           - with respect to the customer duplication=20
issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to=20
discuss this issue with them and to  propose a resolution that would see the=
=20
retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the=20
degree of overlap and whether   there was an acceptable solution to any=20
problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high. =20
Direct is talking to Onsource   and Toronto about this.  I am checking with=20
our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK=20

and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne,=20
Onsource, Enersource,   and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer=
=20
education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss=20
this idea    further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron=20
of  up to $200,000.                              - with respect to the=20
contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is=20

likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and=20
the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral  account).=20
The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not=

ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that   the OEB/gov't is looking=

for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as=20

OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I=20
