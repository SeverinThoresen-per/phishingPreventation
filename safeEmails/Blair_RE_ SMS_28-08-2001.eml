Lynn,
I am working on a presentation for Dave Neubauer and I am needing an example=
 of a SMS chart to include in the power point presentation.  Do you have a c=
hart that you could e-mail to me, so that I could include it in the presenta=
tion. It doesn't matter which of the 4 charts you send. Thanks!
Courtney Barker
