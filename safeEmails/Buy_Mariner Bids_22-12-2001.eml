Scott- I discussed the sale of Mariner's deepwater assets with Dave Gorte an=
d he confirmed that any sale would require both creditors committee and bank=
ruptcy court approval prior to consummation of the deal. We don't believe th=
ere would be any issue with the sale. I hope this is consistent with your un=
derstanding. Rick Buy
