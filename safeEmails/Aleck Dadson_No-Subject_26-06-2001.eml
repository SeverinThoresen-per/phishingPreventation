Priggish and piggish in California

Mark Steyn
National Post
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but=20
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's=20
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South=20
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island,=20
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio=20
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village,=20
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island=20
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's=20
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside=20
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's=
=20
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New=20
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa,=20
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact=20
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British=20
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when=20
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's bee=
n=20
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the=20
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green,=
=20
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in=20
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were=20
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the=20
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return=20
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was=20
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and=20
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its=20
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay fo=
r=20
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.)=20
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the bes=
t=20
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for =
a=20
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when i=
t=20
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush=20
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, Californi=
a=20
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in=20
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of=20
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of=20
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio=20
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in=20
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio=20
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the=20
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000=20
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, bu=
t=20
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisi=
s=20
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming=20
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California.=
=20
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And=20
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? B=
y=20
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that=20
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're=20
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at=
=20
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power=20
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber=20
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO=
=20
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's=20
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could=20
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence=20
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make=20
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr.=
=20
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in=20
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of=20
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction:=20
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living=20
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery=
,=20
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a=20
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price=20
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another=20
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one=
=20
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic=20
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you buil=
d=20
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's=20
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a=20
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office.=20
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching=
=20
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to=20
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price=20
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy=
=20
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those=20
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service=20
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public=20
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable,"=20
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps,=20
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members=
=20
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean,=
=20
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in=
=20
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop ever=
y=20
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a=
=20
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the=20
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about=20
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just=20
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable=
=20
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just=20
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century=20
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet it=
s=20
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than=20
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an=20
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly=20
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own,=20
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous,=
=20
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world=20
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to=20
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.
