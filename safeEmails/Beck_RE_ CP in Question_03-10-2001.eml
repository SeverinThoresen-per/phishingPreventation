Beth,

I have voice mailed John Brindle, Sr. Director, Corp-Public Affairs, who acc=
ording to Bill Donovan is currently responsible for International Security a=
nd the correct Enron Contact on this matter. =20

In summary, the CP in question (Mustafa M Ahmad - only a name match we are n=
ot certain of an exact match) was set up in GCP as an EES Gas customer as pa=
rt of the legacy cleanup during August.  A CP with this name is listed in th=
e HP9EESOCA billing system as active.  The record has been suspended in GCP =
by London and based on our records and research there is no active A/R or MT=
M exposure.

Expect that upon further instructions from John Brindle, and confirmation of=
 an exact match, we will proceed with Settlements and potentially CSC as app=
ropriate.

Awaiting further instructions from John Brindle.

James

James

In response to the recent order from President Bush to freeze any assets hel=
d in the name of a published list of groups and individuals suspected of ter=
rorist activity, we conducted a search of the GCP database to ensure we did =
not have any established relationship with anyone on the list.

We found no such relationships with Enron Europe.  However, we thought we ha=
d better inform you that we did discover one record, created for Houston EES=
, with the following name which did appear on the list:

Mustafa M Ahmad GCP ID 130061.

The ID has been suspended by my GCP team here.  Please let me know if you ne=
ed any further information. =20

Kind regards

Anna
