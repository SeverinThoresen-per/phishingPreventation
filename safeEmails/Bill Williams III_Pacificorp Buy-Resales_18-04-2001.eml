Group,
When doing a buy-resale with Pacificorp, we need to agree on the buy and the=

resale prices on the phone.  These prices need to be recorded in your trade=20
log.  We also need to now check the prices nightly on buy-resales with=20
Pacificorp when doing the SAR.  We are having numerous discrepancies with=20
Pacificorp because of problems with buy-resale deal entry.  I have listened=20
to several tapes where only the spread ($10 or $20 dollars) is mentioned. =20
Let's be sure to  establish these prices, do the confirms nightly, and make=20
sure we can continue to work closely with this counterparty.=20

On a separate note...please be sure to use two tags on any buy-resales.

Thanks.
