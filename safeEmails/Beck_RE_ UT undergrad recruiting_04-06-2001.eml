Kristin, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT re=
cruiting.  The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordin=
ate with our two assistants on a time that will work.  My assistant is Patti=
 Thompson (x39106) and Rick's assistant is Sharron Westbrook.   By copy of t=
his note, I will ask  Patti to coordinate with Sharron and one of the two wi=
ll get back with you to let you know available dates and times that Rick and=
 I could get with you.  -Sally=20
