Subject: ARTO Progress

A quick update on ARTO....

Since taking the reigns from Jeff we have been concentrating on getting a=20
seat at the table with ARTO to discuss day 2 congestion mgmt (CM).  We have=20
been (tentatively) successful (i.e. we have a toe in the door but not a seat=
=20
at the table).

=A3 Initially ARTO were not interested in pursuing a stakeholder process to=20
discuss market design issues. They held a stakeholder meeting in Columbus on=
=20
3/22 where we suggested that they set up a meaningful stakeholder process. =20
This was supported by a majority of stakeholders at the meeting.   However i=
t=20
appeared to fall on deaf ears.
=A3 As a result of that meeting we assisted EPSA draft a letter to the ARTO=20
mgmt committee setting out our concerns and proposing a stakeholder process=20
that if implemented would avoid us going to FERC (the threat was implicit in=
=20
the letter).
=A3 ARTO held a second stakeholder meeting in Baltimore.  At that meeting th=
ey=20
proposed a stakeholder process along the lines set out in the EPSA letter=20
(the Market Development Advisory Group will meet every two weeks to reach=20
concensus on day 2 CM).  We also suggested a tentative governance structure=20
and a way of ensuring that ARTO fully considered our input.  While it is=20
unclear whether ARTO are 'genuinely' seeking input from this group or trying=
=20
to appease FERC, the setting up of the process is a useful step for us.  We=20
can use the process to attempt to gain concensus around a fully developed 2=20
day CM solution, propose this to ARTO and work with them on implementation b=
y=20
12/15/2002.   If ARTO refuse to adopt it we should have a stronger case with=
=20
FERC as we will be able to show the process, output and lack of consideratio=
n=20
by ARTO.  I am sure that ARTO are aware of this so i am trying to work out=20
their angle, maybe they are being genuine (still it pays to be a sceptic at=20
this stage).
=A3 To start building concensus around a day 2 CM solution i have asked a sm=
all=20
group of stakeholders to assist us develop a framework (at this stage the=20
small goup is Edison Mission, Constellation, Duke Energy, PG&E and Reliant).=
 =20
They are happy for us to take the lead on developing this framework (no=20
prizes for anyone who guesses what that framework looks like) and to start=20
thinking about how we get wider concensus amongst stakeholders.

So some positive movement.  I am also opening up communications with ARTO=20
mgmt committee members (have talked to Comed and started with Illinois Power=
=20
through Dynegy....Ron & I are trying to set up a second meeting with AEP=20
mgmt) and Janine is setting up a roadshow so we can visit other interested=20
parties in the ARTO region over May/June.

A couple of other related points.  It would be useful to get in front of the=
=20
decision makers at Dynegy to see where they are at generally...there is some=
=20
differing feedback from the people i know so it is not clear what their=20
corporate position is (i may need a hand here!).  This is reflected in the=20
second point...at the last ARTO stakeholder mtg we were told that ARTO had t=
o=20
make a decision whether to select 'pay as bid' or 'single market clearing=20
price' as the mechanism to determine price discovery.  We were told that 7=20
out of the 10 ARTO mgmt commttee preferred 'pay as bid'.  Anyway we argued=20
for 'single market clearing price'.  We also suggested that transmission=20
owners should not make a decision that affected market participants.  We=20
managed to convince a some stakeholder with our arguments and ARTO held a=20
spot vote that recorded 3 for 'pay as bid', 9 for 'single market clearing=20
price and 9 'not enough info'....i have heard to ARTO took this into account=
=20
and will leave it to stakeholders which again is a positive step for the=20
process. I strongly supported 'single market clearing price' whereas Dynegy=20
was a strong proponent for 'pay as bid' but having talked to their people in=
=20
Houston they say that that is not their position (its seems like they have=20
the same problem as other large firms....).  So getting time with their=20
decision makers would be useful.


I hope this update is useful, give me a call with any queries or feedback.

regards
MR

Christi, could you forward this to the traders if you think it is useful for=
=20
them.
