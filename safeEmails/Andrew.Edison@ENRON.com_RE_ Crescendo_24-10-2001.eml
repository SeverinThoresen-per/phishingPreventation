The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate cont=
act for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is pr=
obably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact informati=
on on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the=
 helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy =
is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all. =
