The cutover of the SCADA system and associated databases from St. Rose to Ha=
yes Road was completed last night. According to ChevronTexaco, the control s=
ystem and databases are functioning properly. However, the direct connection=
 to our pipeline data is not available this morning. ChevronTexaco is invest=
igating, and I will provide an update when the problem is resolved.
