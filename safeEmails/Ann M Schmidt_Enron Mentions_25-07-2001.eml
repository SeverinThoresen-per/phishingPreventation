Natural Gas Project Decision Due Soon-Venezuelan Official

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Venezuela should announce a decision in the next few=20
days on developers for natural gas projects in the country, Ignacio Arcaya,=20
ambassador of Venezuela to the United States, told a press briefing Tuesday=20
morning.=20
The natural gas project was one of the topics Arcaya addressed during the=20
briefing. U.S. companies including Enron Corp. (ENE) and Exxon Mobil Corp.=20
(XON) are competing for pieces of the project.
Venezuela has the largest gas reserves outside of the Middle East, he said.=20
The country would like to tap those reserves for exports as well as for use=20
internally.=20
To do so, Venezuela needs to develop gas infrastructure as well as gas=20
production. The country needs to expand its gas pipeline system and build=20
facilities for liquefied natural gas exports.=20
He also hopes that another Venezuelan energy export - orimulsion - will find=
=20
buyers in the Untied States. A natural bitumen, orimulsion is a patented fue=
l=20
designed for use in electric power generation.=20
Florida power generators failed to get approval to use the fuel after a test=
=20
program in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Another study of the fuel,=20
conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, won't be negative or=20
positive for orimulsion, Arcaya said.=20
He hopes that study will lead to orimulsion consumption in the U.S. A number=
=20
of companies are interested in joint ventures to import the fuel into the=20
United States.=20
A study out of Tampa, Fla., says that orimulsion is less polluting than coal=
=20
and could be used to generate 20% of that city's power, he said.=20
The ambassador said he didn't know anything about reports of an emergency=20
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss=20
production cuts.=20
OPEC sources have reported that the cartel is discussing holding a meeting=20
Aug. 6 or Aug. 14 to discuss cuts in response to lower crude oil prices.=20
Venezuela doesn't want high oil prices because that hurts consumers, but low=
=20
oil prices hurt producers, he said.=20
The country now exports 60% of its crude oil production and 40% of its=20
refined products output, Arcaya said. The plan is to reverse those figures.=20
Part of that plan will include investments to increase output of refined=20
products from Venezuelan refineries, he said. The increased output will meet=
=20
U.S. environmental specifications for refined products.=20
He reiterated Venezuela's plans to increase output of refined products at=20
Citgo's Lake Charles, La., refinery by 100,000 barrels a day. He didn't know=

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- It used to be the only reason to buy shares in=20

However, a series of key deals and an improving bottom line in core=20
operations have helped Germany's two blue-chip utility giants, E.On AG (EON)=

Both companies have made quick strides since Germany's electricity market wa=

The key deals in core markets include RWE's takeover of Thames Water last=20

It has also proven it can cut the fat out of operations. When it released=20

Though it released earnings data promptly after the end of its fiscal year,=20
some were disappointed that except for sales, RWE failed to release operatin=

and net profit figures beyond giving percentages to the general market,=20
though it provided more detailed information to analysts at subsequent=20

"We think RWE shows greater signs than E.On...of wanting to take the=20

Full control of Ruhrgas would make E.On "the number two player in gas in=20

However, he added Germany's Federal Cartel Office would want the gas market=20

"Besides the regulatory opposition, there are signs that other market=20

FERC Should Oversee All Utilities, Lawmaker Says (Update1)

FERC Should Oversee All Utilities, Lawmaker Says (Update1)

     (Adds that energy department, FERC officials will testify
before the committee in 16th paragraph.)

     Washington, July 24 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government agency
that regulates interstate electricity prices should get expanded
authority to oversee all public and cooperative power utilities,
the chairman of the Senate's energy panel said.
     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approves wholesale
interstate electricity rates for investor-owned utilities and
power sellers, such as Enron Corp. The proposal from Senator Jeff
Bingaman would add to the FERC's jurisdiction federal utilities
such as Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electricity cooperatives
and public power utilities.
     Extending FERC's power will help deregulate electricity
markets so that new generating companies can compete against
utilities, Bingaman said.
     ``To leave a legislative solution for another day would be to
ensure the problems faced now in California and the West will be
replicated across the country,'' the New Mexico Democrat said.
     Bingaman's panel next week will begin debating legislation to
address conservation, natural gas drilling and other energy
issues. It may include electricity deregulation, he said.
     The proposal may help make it easier for private companies
compete against public utilities that traditionally have had
monopolies in many regional markets, one analyst said.
     ``There may be merit to this,'' said Pietro Nivola, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based policy
group. The plan may ``ensure that markets are operating freely.''

                           Rate Setting

     Any move to boost FERC's power to enforce ``just and
reasonable'' wholesale rates, though, would be unwise, he said.
     ``They should cease worrying about if the prices are fair and
make the market more competitive,'' Nivola said.
     Last month, the FERC set limits on the wholesale prices for
energy in California after lawmakers, including Bingaman,
criticized the agency for not intervening earlier to help the
state as it faced power shortages and rising prices.
     Critics of the price limits such as Senator Frank Murkowski
of Alaska, the senior Republican on the energy committee, have
said they will discourage companies from building generators in
California because of fears that the caps will cut into profits.
     California in 1996 deregulated its wholesale electricity
market and allowed prices to fluctuate based on supply and demand.
Rising electricity use, a lack of new power plants and low
rainfall that hurt hydroelectric facilities drove up prices last
year, leaving California's two largest utilities insolvent with
almost $14 billion in debt. The state began buying power on their
behalf in January and has spent almost $8 billion.
     Under the Bingaman proposal, utilities would set rates,
overseen by FERC to make sure they are comparable to the rates
utilities charge themselves. The agency also would get authority
over rates charged for power within states, not just interstate
transmissions.
     The plan would let FERC force utilities to team up in
regional organizations to better manage their power grids.
Currently, some transmission system management is handled state-by-
state.
     FERC also would aid in approving sites for transmission lines
with input from regional governments, under Bingaman's proposal.
States now control the location of the lines.
     Francis Blake, the deputy energy secretary, will testify
before the committee tomorrow on the Bingaman plan. The five FERC
commissioners, including Chairman Curt Hebert, will discuss the
plan before the panel on Thursday.




Energy Generators Fall With Gas, Electricity Prices (Update1)

Energy Generators Fall With Gas, Electricity Prices (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share prices in second and third
paragraphs and analyst comment in eighth paragraph.)

     New York, July 24 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of El Paso Corp.,
Williams Cos., NRG Energy Inc. and other energy producers and
natural-gas suppliers tumbled because of falling gas and
electricity prices, analysts said.
     Speculation the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is
ready to toughen rules on business between pipeline companies and
trading affiliates also drove shares lower, analysts said.
     Shares of El Paso, owner of the largest U.S. interstate
pipeline network, fell $4.26, or 8.2 percent, to $47.64. Earlier,
they touched $47.20, a 52-week low. Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, fell $3.42, or 7.3 percent, to $43.24. It touched a
52-week low of $42.
     Williams Cos., a pipeline company and trader, fell $2.07, or
6.4 percent, to $30.28. Calpine Corp. fell $4.25, or 11 percent,
to $33.90. NRG fell $2.35, or 11 percent, to $19.15. Earlier, it
touched a 52-week low of $18.40.
     Salomon Smith Barney Inc. analyst Ray Niles cut his ratings
on several energy generators because lower power and gas prices
probably will hurt third-quarter earnings.
     The average price of electricity in California so far this
month had fallen 41 percent from a year ago, partly because new
generators have opened. Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange
fell today to $2.97 per million British thermal units. That's down
from around $10 per million British thermal units in late
December.
     FERC has been investigating whether El Paso held back
pipeline capacity in California to drive gas price higher. FERC
might issue new rules on affiliate business this week, Dow Jones
Newswires has reported.
     ``There's concern about what FERC might come out with
tomorrow,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey said. ``(It is) a
combination of a lot of issues.''
     He cited the pipeline affiliates' code-of-conduct rules and
the dispute over refunds to California by power generators.
     Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, couldn't confirm
whether the commission would discuss new rules at its meeting
tomorrow. Tomorrow's agenda includes standards of conduct for
transmission providers. Allen declined to say whether the rule
would deal directly with company affiliates.

Black Hills to Purchase Generation Complex From Enron (Update1)

Black Hills to Purchase Generation Complex From Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with closing stock activity in fourth paragraph.)

     Rapid City, South Dakota, July 24 (Bloomberg) -- Black Hills
Corp., a utility owner that primarily operates in the western
U.S., agreed to buy Enron Corp.'s power-generation complex in
North Las Vegas, Nevada, for an undisclosed price.
     The purchase will eventually add 273 megawatts of power to
Black Hills Energy Capital, Black Hills' independent power unit,
the company said in a statement. The acquisition should be
completed during the third quarter, the company said.
     Black Hill plans to add a plant adjacent to the current 51-
megawatt Enron North America site. The new combined-cycle
generation site, which would have an output of 222 megawatts, is
expected to begin operating in the third quarter of 2002 and boost
Black Hills Energy's total output to 1,000 megawatts.
     Shares of Rapid City, South Dakota-based Black Hills fell
$2.56, or 6 percent, to $40.14. Houston-based Enron, the largest
energy trader, fell $3.42, or 7 percent, to $43.24.
