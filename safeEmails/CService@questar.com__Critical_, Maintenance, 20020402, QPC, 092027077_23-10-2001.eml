RE:  NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS

Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) is planning to perform Clay Basin invento=
ry verification and deliverability tests beginning April 2, 2002.  These tes=
ts will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory v=
erification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test.=20
D
 uring the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize =
their storage service.  However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverabi=
lity test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capaci=
ty holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal cap=
acity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period. =20

Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of the=
ir gas supply during this time period.  Questar is interested in finding way=
s to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers.  Please contact yo=
ur Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.
