	Andy,

	This will update you on this matter.  You may recall that it is a collectio=
n matter for about $1,800,000 for breach of spot gas purchase contracts by T=
riad.  We tried to arbitrate, but Triad wouldn't answer the arbitration (eve=
n though I got calls from Purnell afterward, who asked if there was some way=
 we could settle the arbitration).  We then filed suit in the 125th Judicial=
 District Court of Harris County, Texas, against both Triad and Purnell, to =
see if that would smoke them out. =20

	As you know, after filing our original petition, we found an inadvertant te=
chnical error in it that required correction, and at no charge to you refile=
d a first amended petition that corrected the error.  Since then, we served =
the first amended petition and citations on the Secretary of State of the St=
ate of Texas, as is allowed by law under such circumstances.  The Secretary =
of State then forwarded the first amended petition and citations to the addr=
esses we gave them, by certified mail, r.r.r.  At this time, which is long a=
fter the expiration of the answer date, no certified mail receipt has report=
edly been received by the Secretary of State from Purnell or Triad.  No answ=
er or other pleading has been filed by Triad or Purnell.

	This is not unexpected, given that Triad dodged us during the attempted arb=
itration.  The caselaw supports the position that we have made effective ser=
vice on both Triad and Purnell, although there is some room to argue that th=
e Secretary of State has to receive a green card back, even if it is marked =
"refused".  If we wanted to try to nail this point down by going to the addi=
tional expense of personal service on Triad and Purnell, we could, but if Pu=
rnell is not going to respond to registered mail, he will likely attempt to =
dodge personal service as well.  I am not recommending it.

	We will shortly receive from the Secretary of State the so-called "Whitney =
Certificate" and file-stamped copies of the citations, which we will file wi=
th the court, along with a motion for entry of default judgment.  I will mak=
e sure you see a draft before it is filed.

	We will need to set a hearing on our motion, and produce evidence of our da=
mages.  I would not expect the hearing to take more than an hour.  We previo=
usly filed an affidavit signed by Bryce, as well as a matrix for computing o=
ur prejudgment interest (given that there were many spot gas sales, and prej=
udgement interest as to each would start at different times) prepared by Shi=
elah Castro.  I will follow up with them to see if they would be willing and=
 available to come with me to testify at the hearing, and will of course ful=
ly prepare them beforehand.  Also, I will need to testify regarding our atto=
rneys' fees in this matter.

	Parenthetically, given the length of time this matter has been on file, it =
has been routinely set on the dismissal for want of prosecution docket.  As =
you know, it is merely a formality and I will file the appropriate motion to=
 get this taken care of.  I will send you a draft of that if you wish.  A he=
aring is set on this docket for October 23, at which time I presently have a=
 conflict, and Bonnie has kindly agreed to attend in my place if necessary. =
 No one else need be at that hearing.

	Please let me know if there is anyone else who needs to be in the loop on t=
his.
=09
	I will keep you advised.

	Britt
