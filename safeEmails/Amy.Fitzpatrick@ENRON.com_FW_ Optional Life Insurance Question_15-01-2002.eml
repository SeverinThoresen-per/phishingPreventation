Amy, since the Netco employee's would be terminating off of Enron's Payroll =
they would still have access to converting the current life insurance covera=
ges with Enron over to an individual policy with Metlife as long as they com=
plete the conversion form within 31 days of losing their coverage.  They wou=
ld then have to pay for this expense out of pocket.

Thanks, Tony

     Hi Tony......
    =20
     Unfortunately, I dont think so, since the employees are not=20
     transferring.  They are considered to be new hires.   As a result, the=20
     carrier will request their usual EOI requirements.   They typically=20
     require a blood sample and urine sample.  Pending the results of those=20
     tests, they may request a physical.
    =20
     Thanks Tony.

Vince, we have a question from one of our employees that has an optional lif=
e in
surance policy for $1,064,000.00.  The employee currently has a base pay of =
$185
,004.00.  A clause in the UBS Optional Life Insurance policy states  "eviden=
ce o
f insurability is required for coverage of over 3 times your base salary or =
$700
,000, whichever is less."   What will this employee need to keep their cover=
age=20
at approximately the same level during the transition to UBS?  Would a confi=
rmat
ion statement from Enron for 2002 Open Enrollment elections suffice as=20
"evidenceof insurability"?
    =20
Thanks, Tony Jarrett
