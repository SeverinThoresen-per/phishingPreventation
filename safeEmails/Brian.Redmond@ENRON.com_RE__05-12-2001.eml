Does it make sense to try to get together to talk about Bridgeline?  I am no=
t sure if you tried to contact Jean but from what I understand, I suspect th=
at she is not willing to help.  Maybe, we gather everyone else that knows an=
ything about the deal, put them all in a room and extract as much info as po=
ssible.  Then, we can try to summarize the state of affairs and recommend va=
rious courses of action.  Your thoughts.

Stuart
