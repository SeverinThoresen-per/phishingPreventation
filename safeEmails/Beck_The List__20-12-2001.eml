Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to sui=
tors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this mornin=
g.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconci=
le to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitt=
ed that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new =
names that we would substitute for someone who leaves. =20

Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and m=
e.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details =
of a daily report starting tomorrow. =20

Thanks.  --Sally=20
