Lynn, =20

I had a request from Darrell to set him up with update capabilities to nomin=
ations, confirmations and scheduled quantities.  Currently I have both Gary =
and Darrell set up with update capabilities to the process control and inqui=
ry to all of the TMS screens.  Let me know if you are OK with them having an=
y kind of update capabilites and I will get a form together for your approva=
l.

Thanks,

Maggie=20
