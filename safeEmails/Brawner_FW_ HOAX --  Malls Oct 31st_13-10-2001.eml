>To All:
>This story is a hoax and is debunked on the Urban Legends site

>There have been a lot if rumors and misinformation circulating on the
>Internet since the Sept. 11 attacks. The vast majority are just that --
>unsubstantiated rumors created by people with overactive imaginations.
>Unfortunately, these rumors spread very quickly via email,  frighten people
>unnecessarily, and divert time and resources from actual threats.

>Next time you receive an email like this, think twice about passing it
along
>to others. Unless the story is substantiated by a reputable source, such as
>CNN, NY Times, or the other major news outlets, I suggest you delete it and
>forget it. The last thing we need to be doing during these trying times is
>to perpetuate rumors that alarm the public. That's just what terrorists
want
