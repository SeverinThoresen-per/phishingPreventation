I will mail the checks and money to Barb.  There was one other item that I w=
as going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for th=
e last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said th=
at many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could pu=
blish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much o=
fficial material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "f=
iller".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via =
an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the rec=
ipe in my briefcase.=20

Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!

At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provid=
ed a list by month of desired national information (from the national websit=
e) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.=
  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the =
office a little later. =20

Thanks again for all of your hard work!!! --Sally=20

Sally - sorry I didn't get back to you tonight; it was late when we got home=
 from post-volleyball dinner and then the kids were on the phone - and inter=
net until now.  It's been a long day to start the week!

We have a lot of ads this month (9)!  They will be "scattered" throughout th=
e newsletter rather than all being placed on the back page, as they won't al=
l fit in the half page.  If you'd like to mail the checks to Barb Lindsey (5=
523 Grosvenor Square, Houston 77069), that would be fine.  I don't keep the =
pink sheets once the newsletter is mailed out.

Nancy sent me a message that there will not be an official food drive at the=
 Holiday Tea, and no announcement in the newsletter.  She indicates that we'=
ll focus on the book drive for The Bridges, and Adopt-A-Family, and that, wi=
th the Sr. Presentation fees and tea fees all due in one month, it would be =
too much to do a food drive, too.  However, she said that if food items arri=
ve we'll deliver them to NAM or TEAM.  If that's not still correct, please l=
et me know.

Thanks!  Robin

P.S.  Boomer Sooner - Go OU!
