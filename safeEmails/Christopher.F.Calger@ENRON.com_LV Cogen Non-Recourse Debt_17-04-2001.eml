I was incorrect.  The existing non-recourse debt for Las Vegas ($55MM) is of=
f-balance sheet and off-credit.  It does not show up as a liability on our b=
alance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes.   If the plant blew up, we=
 would be out $24MM, not $79MM.  We get this treatment because it is a fair =
market value asset and we have a Friend of Enron minority investor that keep=
s our stated interest below 50%.  Our interest for control purposes is over =
50% because we have a call option on the Friend of Enron shares.
