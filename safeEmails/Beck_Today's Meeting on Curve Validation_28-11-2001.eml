Our curve validation process is one of the key items that Arthur Andersen wi=
ll be reviewing at year end.  AA has looked for us to strengthen this proces=
s, and Tom Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely a=
t this.  (His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate =
that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!) =20

In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads a=
cross all commodities.  I want to hear from them in a protected environment =
today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.  We will r=
eview the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the ta=
sk force lead by Shona Wilson) and discuss specific action steps to insure t=
hat we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.  I have a meeting w=
ith Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week and, following today's meet=
ing, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.=
 =20

You are welcome to join us in this meeting.  If you do not attend, please ge=
t with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aw=
are of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improveme=
nts that may need to be made quickly. =20

The meeting will be held as follows:  	3:00 - 3:30 PM=20
					ECS  4102 (my office)=20
