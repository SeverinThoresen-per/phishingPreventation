Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail.  Chris and I usually handle=20
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business=20
begins.
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?=
 =20
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you=20
switch, keep in mind:

For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the=20
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland=
,=20
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would=20
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund=20
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transpor=
t=20
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and=20
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have=20
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your=20
business party.

For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless tol=
d=20
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.

I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any=20
questions.
Scott
