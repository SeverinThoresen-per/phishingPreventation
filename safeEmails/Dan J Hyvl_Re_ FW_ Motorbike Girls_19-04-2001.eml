Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and
went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, "Since you've
such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is,
you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it
for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St.  Peter took=20
Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God=
,=20
"Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said=20
Arthur,"professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in=20
your invention.=20
1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion.=20
2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds.=20
3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much.=20
4.  The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.  And finally,=20
5.  The maintenance costs are outrageous."=20
"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on." God=20
went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for th=
e=20
results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.  "Well,=20
it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but=20
according to these numbers,more men are riding my invention than yours."
