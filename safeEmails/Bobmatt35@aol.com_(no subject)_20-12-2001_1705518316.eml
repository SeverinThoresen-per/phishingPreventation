Mike,

Sorry, I did not get a chance to say goodbye.  It was kind of crazy the day =
that they told everyone to leave.

I wish you all of the luck there.  From the paper this morning, it looks lik=
e that you will be auctions to the highest bidder.  It is kind of sad. =20

I am currently working out of Enron's out placement service in Allen III.  T=
he facilities are pretty nice.  The job market is pretty slow.  It gives me =
plenty of time to get my yard in shape.  Ha!

Also, I have been spending a lot of time at Rockport.  The next time you go =
down there in the future, please come by and see our place.  We are on Fulto=
n Beach Road just north of Trailor Inn By The Bay.  You never know, I may be=
 moving there sooner than you think.  Ha!

Take care and good luck always.

Bob
