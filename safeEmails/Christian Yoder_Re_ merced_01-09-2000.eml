Stewart,
Yesterday at our meeting with Tim, I thought it was fairly clear that effort=
s=20
were to be made before deals were done to check out authorization.  This=20
morning you tell us you have done a 3 year deal with Merced and ask us to=20
check out the authorization question after the fact.   This is exactly the=20
opposite of what I thought we were all trying to do.  We don't really need t=
o=20
call Merced.  We have the relevant legal paper.  You need to get  the=20
attorney from the finance group, Sara,  to tell you whether or not Merced is=
=20
authorized to do the deal you have already done.

I am working with the guys at Turlock to check out their authorizations. =20

Thanks for the response - You both have the approprate person at Merced to=20
contact to get clarification with respect to authorization.  They are aware=20
that you may call.  At this point they are fully hedged in the near term so=20
future deals will be back years (precisely the term we may be concerned with=
).

The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters.=20
The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March=20
16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager "...to develop and=20
provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master=20
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading=20
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for=
=20
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such=20
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as t=
o=20
form."  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions=
=20
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates=20
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced=20
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a=20
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced=
=20
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions=
,=20
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying=
=20
resolution. =20

Does our ISDA with Merced contain wording that gives us legal comfort if we=20
do an 18 month trade?---cgy

You need to call Jim Day 916-441-0131 to discuss any authority issues=20
concerning Merced trades. He can discuss charter particulars.
