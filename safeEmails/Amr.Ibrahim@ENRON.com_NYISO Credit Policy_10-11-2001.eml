NYISO Credit Policy
The NYISO has established the following creditworthiness policy to ensure th=
at customer can meet its obligations and to protect against the risk of non-=
payment of invoices.  A summary of this policy is as follows:
1.	To assure credit worthiness, a NYISO customer may provide a cash deposit,=
 an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (from an acceptable Ameri=
can or Canadian Bank with A credit rating from S&P, or A2 by Moody's), or ob=
tain corporate guarantee from its parent company for all financial obligatio=
ns under the tariffs; assuming that the parent company complies with credit =
ratings acceptable.  The amount of the instrument equals the sum of the cust=
omer's obligations to the NYISO for three months (the greatest over a rollin=
g 12-month period).
2.	In lieu of cash deposits, letters of credit, or corporate guarantee, the =
customer must submit initially, and annually thereafter, a current debt-rati=
ng agency of a minimum of "BBB" or "Baa2" by SP, or Moody's respectively. =20

3.	Any services provided under the Tariff may be terminated either immediate=
ly (for Service Tariffs) or upon 60 days prior notice (OATT) if the customer=
 fails to demonstrate its creditworthiness. =20
A NYISO customer must immediately inform the NYISO of any material change in=
 its financial position.
