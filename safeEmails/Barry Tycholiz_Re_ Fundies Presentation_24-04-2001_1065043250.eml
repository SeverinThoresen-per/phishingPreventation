This packages will always be a work in progress ....make sure that the messa=
ge that you are intending to deliver is delivered so have a wrap up slide(s)=
 that brings the whole thing home and leaves your customers with a summarize=
d version of your presentation.

Kim, I would like to use this format in our discussions with Long Beach and =
Palo Alto... In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the ma=
terial is in the format you would like. =20

Also, our discussions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and=
 their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of th=
is data but not enough to bring in recommendations.

As part of our discussions, we need a section on Risk Management Services, h=
istorical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommendations on some risk manageme=
nt products and then next steps slides.=20

Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outs=
ourcing of some of their load.  I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we=
 setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term =
and short term incentives on their price vs Socal.=20

I will call you on Tues. a.m. =20
