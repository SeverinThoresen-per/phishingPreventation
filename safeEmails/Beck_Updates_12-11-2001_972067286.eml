Everyone worked hard and did a good job on Friday night and Saturday.  From =
IT, Jenny Rub, Steve Stock, Iain Greig, Anthony Dayao and Ramesh Rao were ve=
ry engaged and did some great work.  Jeff Johnson was kept updated while in =
route back to Houston and he is in the office today reviewing the work that =
has been done to date.  Other ENW team members hard at work with us over the=
 weekend have been Bob Hall, Beth Apollo, Kevin Sweeney, Kerry Roper and Mar=
la Barnard. =20

Greg P. and I met with Kerry Roper this am to review the summarized version =
of the work that has been done.  Looks good - and it is unlikely that we wil=
l get with Greg Whalley to review the data this weekend.  He's meeting with =
commercial teams currently, and then will be on a plane for NYC later today.=
  We will take tomorrow to incorporate any changes that Jeff Johnson may hav=
e, and to get the entire weekend team to review and affirm (or change) the d=
ata as it is now summarized.  =20

I will e-mail Greg W. an update on the work that we have done today and will=
 copy you on that message.  Greg P. and I decided not to e-mail the details =
to him - better to review in person.  He will know that we are ready. =20

Quick preview of Monday's intended schedule:

Outstanding item on cost savings efforts:  We didn't include or touch the IS=
C.  Their budget for 2002 is included in Corp., but since responsibility now=
 rests with you, we need to get Allan involved in the same exercise that we =
worked over the weekend.  Would you like for me to meet with him on Monday t=
o get him started?  Then you can take it from there?  Or would you like to w=
ait and address this with Allan when you are back in the office?  Just let m=
e know.=20

Have a good flight back.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do for=
 you tomorrow while you are in route back to Houston.  --Sally=20
