I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think th=
e=20
gas will flow for the month and at what price.  I will use your decision for=

our bidweek postion.

FYI,

How would you want to handle for February nomination?

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin productio=
n=20
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees=
=20
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from th=
e=20
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect=20
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best=20
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve=20
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over th=
e=20
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows=
=20
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next=20
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and=20
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited=20
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this=20
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning=20
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close=20
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for=20
liquids fallout.
