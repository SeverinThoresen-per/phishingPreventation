Here is the memo we discussed this morning, wherein I reiterated to the PSCo=
=20
project team the "must have" language that Lisa Bills said she needed for=20
equipment orders into West LB.  She has subsequently told us that E-Next=20
requires the same approach.

Subject: FVP Purchase Orders

The following is the "must have" language for the equipment purchase orders:
1) No reference to NEPCo.  The deal will be between the vendor as seller, an=
d=20
ENA as agent for West LB as buyer.  There will be no reference to an=20
"Owner". =20
2) The buyer's obligations must be limited to payment of a set price. =20
Cancellation rights are acceptable, but the payment exposure must be set out=
=2E
3) We require termination rights.  Again, it is acceptable that such=20
termination right be coupled with cancellation payments.
4) Assignment provision: must provide that buyer can assign to a "successor=20
financing entity".=20

This is the feed back we have been waiting for, and is the result of the=20
conversations and e-mails we have been engaged in with Rose and Lisa=20
recently.  There is one additional point, as you are aware:  NEPCo and EE&CC=
=20
need to get the purchase orders and option attachment material to us (i.e.=20
the deal team, and ENA legal) for scrubbing before it goes to Lisa and Rose.=
 =20
They can review the material for compatibility with West LB and TurboPark=20
requirements, but not for commercial workability. =20

I may miss your phone call this afternoon, if it comes off, as I am headed t=
o=20
the airport.  This info should be imparted to NEPCo and EE&CC. =20
