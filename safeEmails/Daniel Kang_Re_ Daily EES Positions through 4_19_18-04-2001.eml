Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside=20
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in=20
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be=20
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday=20
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality=
,=20
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside=20
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where=20
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value o=
f=20
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were=20
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan
