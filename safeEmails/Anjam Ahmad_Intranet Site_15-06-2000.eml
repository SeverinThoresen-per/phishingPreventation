Dear Dale/all,

Thanks for the interest... I have already contacted intranet development=20
about updates - they don't have to do much except publish the document and=20
maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you=20
suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of=20
well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit=20
risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have=
=20
to be written specifically for this purpose.  If you have time to put any=20
interesting material together (Word docs, text files or Power point=20
presentations), please do pass it on to me and I will collate for the update=
=2E

Regards,

Anjam

Anjam,

This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site=20
and expand the coverage into new areas.  Can you arrange some IT resources=20
for us?  If everyone in Research works on developing the content, we just=20
need IT to publish it out to the intranet.

Thoughts??

- Dale
