Subject:	FW: Move Related Issues



As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend. =20

=B7	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all ne=
w voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetin=
gs and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover th=
e message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when yo=
u arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arr=
ival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on. =20

=B7	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Mon=
day morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it i=
s unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on S=
unday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are=
 needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have be=
en approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

=B7	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the ro=
utes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to=
 share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need a=
dditional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted,=
 please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have thei=
r badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without thei=
r badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the sky=
ring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the ga=
rage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the=
 Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via t=
he 2nd floor and the skyring.

=B7	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a =
list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on=
 the floor when we move in. =20
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

=B7	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscr=
iptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all da=
ily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corri=
dor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the =
papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the pa=
pers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, con=
tact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

=B7	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than=
 about 4  boxes per person. =20

=B7	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels=
, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels prin=
ted.

=B7	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been remov=
ed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are l=
eft on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to mov=
e the computers as scheduled.

=2E	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses fil=
tered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on t=
he floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of wa=
ter due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at s=
everal locations. =20

=B7	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to r=
emind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret o=
r an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiti=
ng for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might =
have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much fo=
r all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDA=
Y, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with =
the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd
