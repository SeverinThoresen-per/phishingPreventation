RICK:
=20
    Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a huminatar=
ian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste news is yet =
to come.   Here is what Ive found out...
=20
    NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up cle=
aring, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, the =
first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though the=
 later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse payments=
 have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is like=
ly to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating the ne=
ed for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an effort =
is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (based on ye=
t to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree of transac=
tion data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment performance from =
NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing payment delays ex=
tend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may see delayed pa=
yments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets.  In this re=
gard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist attacks didnt occu=
r late in the month.  Finally, there have been general comments from Treasur=
y and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payments, and the assum=
ption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY commodity exchanges =
(but this asumption has not been validated or addressed directly in public c=
omments).  Hope this helps.  Brad.

Rick:=20
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned ab=
out the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX=
=2E A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried=
 that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow=
=2E  In this scenario, Enron=B4s large NYMEX position could put it in jeopra=
rdy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX cle=
aring falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYM=
EX payment performance?????
