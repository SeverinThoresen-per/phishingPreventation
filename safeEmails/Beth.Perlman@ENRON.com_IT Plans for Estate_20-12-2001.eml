Greg,

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the e=
state's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in=
 the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we'r=
e receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the =
ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and po=
tentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accentu=
re or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company a=
nd incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement t=
he staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the =
consulting company.=20

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the =
ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and proces=
sing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other =
commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty p=
ayments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is=
 to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want =
to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  W=
e could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estat=
e while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NE=
TCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in som=
e capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  Ther=
e are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we c=
annot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals m=
ust either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the abo=
ve referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline=
).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0=
919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry =
but reception is poor on the island!

Have a great holiday.

Beth
