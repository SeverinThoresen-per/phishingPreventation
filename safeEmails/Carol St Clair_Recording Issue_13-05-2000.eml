On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of=20
limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree tha=
t=20
it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each=20
party's trading floor. This is because all calls that originate out of our=20
trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line.  =
=20
Does that work for you?  I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction=20
tape issue.  Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in th=
e=20
MAC language that we discussed.
