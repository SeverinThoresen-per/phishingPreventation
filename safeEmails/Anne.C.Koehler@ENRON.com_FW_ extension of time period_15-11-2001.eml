Doug,

I believe that we should also extend the time period for the reference of di=
sputed items on the Working Capital Statement since we may not resolve every=
thing by the 4th of December (given the holidays), which by my calculations =
would be the date for referral of disputed working capital items to the inde=
pendent auditors.  Perhaps we could go ahead and build in an extension perio=
d for the working capital items that would coincide with the extension for t=
he inventory.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Anne
