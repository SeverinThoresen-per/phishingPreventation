I agree.  I have told James that we would like to close with CSFB Internatio=
nal and work after the closing to change, if possible, as appropriate.

Dan:  Neither credit nor legal has ever received info about the "Cayman bran=
ch" (if it is a branch) so we have never assessed that entity in full.  Trea=
sa and Raj were trying to avoid use of that entity and trying to stick with =
CSFBI.  Sara

As I do not have any details of this deal, I cannot comment on the need for =
a carve out of margining rights. The only issue that I have been aware of is=
 the Cayman branch possibility.  My comment on that to bothe Raj and Teresa =
was that if it is in fact a different legal entity (as determined by legal) =
then I will need financial information to make an assessment of this entity.=
  If it is a branch and part of CSFB International, which is sometimes the c=
ase with financial institutions, we would have recourse to CSFB Internationa=
l and it would be confirmed under the existing document.=20

Regards,
Tanya

Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirma=
tion would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement. =
 Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but=
 which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya =
may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the co=
nfirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob,=20

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of=
 any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as=
 they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit=
 approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSF=
B here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was th=
e case for the 2000 transaction earlier.=20

Thanks very much for your help.=20

Rajaram Jamadagni
