PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Martin,

Here's the latest.

The Court recently advised that it wishes to have a telephone conference on=20
this case either Monday or Tuesday of next week, depending on the Court's=20
trial schedule at that time.  Tim Mullin believes that it will be solely a=20
status conference to determine whether all briefing has been done, whether=20
anyone wants a hearing, etc.; he does not expect a hearing on the substantiv=
e=20
issues at that time.  Mullin sees it as a good sign that the Court is paying=
=20
attention to this case.

Although we do not need to make this decision before the telephone=20
conference, we may need to retain a Russian lawyer to give us a legal=20
opinion, as a result of Base Metal's recently-filed reply to our motion on=20
the late service by Base Metals on OJSC, the defendant in the underlying=20
case. =20

You may recall that Base Metals was supposed to serve OJSC within 60 days=20
after the attachment.  After we complained about the lack of evidence of suc=
h=20
service, Base Metals alleged it had completed such service, by DHL.  We then=
=20
filed a motion stating that such service was inadequate under applicable=20
federal law.

Base Metals has done an end-run around our previously-filed motion on the=20
service issue by obtaining an affidavit from a Russian lawyer that makes two=
=20
points:  first, that service by DHL would be proper if this matter was filed=
=20
in a court of general jurisdiction in Russia, and second, that there is no=20
prohibition under Russian law to this sort of service, even if the underlyin=
g=20
lawsuit was filed outside Russia.

If we do not respond with our own affidavit, then the Court will probably=20
rule against us on the service issue.  The importance of the service issue i=
s=20
that it is a relatively "quick out" for the Court to consider, the other=20
being that MG Metals is so solvent that no attachment is needed.  What we=20
want to avoid is some protracted litigation on the merits concerning the=20
fraudulent tranfer allegations, as Base Metals can more cheaply and easily=20
develop its evidence on this points from its Russian sources than we can.

Parethentically, there is a recent New York Times article that looks like it=
=20
was written by Base Metal's lawyers, and that uses what happened to OJSC in=20
Russian bankruptcy as an example of how easy it is to use Russian bankruptcy=
=20
for unlawful ends.  I'll send anyone a copy who wants one.

I'll report further after the telephone conference with the Court next week.

Britt
