Catherine,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would=
 be emailing you.  =20

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina=
 from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave Internationa=
l's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphana=
ge at the end of August.  We miss her terribly. =20

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals=
 to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world =
events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to =
bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope=
 was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last w=
eek.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  T=
heir Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orp=
hanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participa=
ted in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me =
to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortun=
ate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- di=
fferent Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa =
and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly im=
proving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yes=
terday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei =
was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding w=
ith me and offering me some travel advice. =20

In His Name,

Shelley Corman
