I think we can change the ranks pretty easily.  As far as the business party=
=20
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?)=20
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was=20
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be takin=
g=20
advantage of.  We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well.

Thanks, d.n.

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES=20
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the=20
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's=20
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA    5304
Brooklyn Union   21995=20
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various=20
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we=20
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert=20
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a=20
great deal of time=20
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity t=
o=20
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swin=
g=20
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

Beverly
