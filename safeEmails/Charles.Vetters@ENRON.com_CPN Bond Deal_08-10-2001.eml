Louise and Dave:

We should monitor this transaction this week.

This week, more than $3 billion of sales have been slated. The largest comes=
 from independent power producer Calpine Corp. (NYSE:CPN </quickchart/quickc=
hart.asp?symb=3DCPN>). It plans to sell $1.35 billion of bonds as part of a =
$2 billion financing drive after Moody's Investors Service last week upgrade=
d its debt to investment-grade.
I would think it would give us some indication whether the credit markets ar=
e there or not.
Charlie
