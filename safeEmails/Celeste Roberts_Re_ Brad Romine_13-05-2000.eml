Celeste,

As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.

The offer from Enron looks much better now. I have arranged for him
a number of different interviews (including one with you). I think we should=
=20
not be too
punitive and give him the 2nd chance. I am setting up for him interviews wit=
h=20
RAC,
EBS and Greg Whalley and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotatio=
n.

Please, give me a call if you have any other question.

Vince Kaminski
