I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure=
 at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my conce=
rns about missing Chad's Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday =
issue.
My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of und=
erstanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will=
 be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel =
10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been tur=
ned in sufficient time.

Shelley,
No, she didn't, and I was too upset about the late November time frame to=20
ask. I was thinking about emailing her and asking her when the documents=20
would be sent and about how long before we have a court date. I didn't even=20
confirm that the 15th was a set date for the other group, but I assume it is=
=2E=20
If we leave a week or so after them, that puts us leaving right at=20
Thanksgiving, which means higher airfare etc...
Should one of us email her or call her and ask?

Liz
