Greg will be coming to visit Monday, October 22nd, and in addition to the da=
y-to-day activity we do with MOPS, he is interested in talking about the ser=
vices we can provide during the interim transition period.  I will be in Lub=
bock that day, so could one of you be the contact for Greg to call when he g=
ets here? =20

Donna, Sarabeth has provided the base services agreement to us, so we do hav=
e a document to start with, but we still need to find out from Williams what=
 specifically they want us to do. We also need to be aware of the issues Rit=
a has brought up regarding system enhancements that would be necessary to ca=
pture bifurcated rates, change the invoice template, provide ad hoc reports =
to Williams, etc. Sarabeth was deliberate in pointing out that the services =
agreement did not contemplate assuming liabilities greater than the value of=
 the contract.  In the event Williams requires higher levels of liability, (=
more than $10,000/mo) we can purchase insurance, and the cost of the premium=
 would be added to our fees.

I'll let you know times when I learn of Greg's travel arrangements.

Thanks, Bob
