I hope all is going well.  I left you an e-mail regarding coming over to wor=
k for you.  I decided to not except the UBS deal, so I wanted to come work f=
or you and Janet.  Since I have already talked with these guys, I am pretty =
much available today going forward.  Again, you know what I have done and I =
think it would be a good fit.  Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Ben
