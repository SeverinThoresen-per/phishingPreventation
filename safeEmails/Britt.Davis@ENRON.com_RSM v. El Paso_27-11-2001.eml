	Just a heads-up:

	Today at 1:30 there will be a joint defense conference call to discuss the =
thoughts of the group on what pleadings to file on or before December 5, the=
 new deadline for defendants to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I believe =
that I previously e-mailed to you drafts prepared by F&J for El Paso and cir=
culated to the group.  Each of the defendant groups is planning to prepare a=
nd file its own pleas to the jurisdiction, answers, and affirmative defenses=
=2E  I will prepare and circulate drafts tailored to the only two Enron defe=
ndants yet served, Enron Corp. and Intratex.  By copy of this, I am asking B=
ecky Stephens to again confirm that we have no evidence that Enron Gas Marke=
ting, Inc. has been served.

	A strategy issue under consideration is whether to file motions to transfer=
 venue for the holding companies, like Enron Corp. So far, based on the due =
diligence I have done to date, it does not appear that Enron Corp. ever owne=
d or operated any facilities in Zapata County (much less measured gas there)=
 or owned any gas reserves or gas in storage, which should be the relevant c=
onsiderations. I was asked by the joint defense group to do some legal resea=
rch on this issue, given that Grynberg has made "in concert" allegations aga=
inst all the defendants, and that we expect Grynberg to rely on venue being =
good against EOG Resources and trying to keep the remaining defendants (thos=
e who are not measurers and therefor independently subject to venue) based o=
n section 15.005 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which allows=
 venue against co-defendants in situations like this where the allegations c=
oncern the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occur=
ences. =20

	In short, the caselaw I have seen causes me a concern we may open ourselves=
 up to merits discovery on the "in concert" allegations by filing a motion t=
o transfer venue on behalf of the holdling companies.  I have already mentio=
ned that to other defense counsel and expect that issue to be discussed at o=
ur telephone conference this afternoon.

	Also, please let me know whether you want me to send any of the proposed pl=
eadings to Barrett Reasoner or Charlie Tetrault, or to discuss our strategy =
Barrett or Charlie, to coordinate with strategy in the Grynberg and Quinque =
cases.

	Parenthetically, our due diligence investigation of Intratex has revealed a=
n accounting document which appears to list an Intratex facility in Zapata C=
ounty.  This makes no sense and is very puzzling to those we have interviewe=
d at Enron about it.  We will be meeting later this week with AEP employees =
who will hopefully be able to shed some light on this.
=09
	I will keep you advised.
