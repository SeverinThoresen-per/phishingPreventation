You can only imagine how disgusting things are over here with the media circ=
us.  I guess being in London I don't have to tell you about media circuses! =
 Hopefully, we'll all be able to get through this and move on to bigger and =
better things.

I'm passing your e-mail along to Susan Bailey, as I don't have any involveme=
nt in the day to day old Enron business.  Hopefully, Susan will be able to h=
elp you.

Take care!

Marie
