Hello Sara,

I received your voice message and called you back but you are not available.

My understanding of where we stand is not consistent with yours.  Here is my=
=20
understanding:

Guaranty: Yes, I got the guaranty executed and have it in my possession.

Assignment  Agreement:  No, we do not have a final draft.  As I mentioned on=
=20
Friday, the last version that Anna sent did not have all of the all of the=20
edits/changes I had recommended to her implemented.  In particular, the=20
arbitration language had not been changed and there were some grammatical=20
edits.  I refaxed my comments today; Anna agreed to implement them and I am=20
awaiting her draft.  (Anna may not have gotten some faxes on Thursday or=20
Friday because her fax number changed when she changed building locations=20
last week). =20

Account Agreement: Yes, you are correct that Anna has to send back a revised=
=20
draft.  She and I have been clling each other every hour.  Anna said that sh=
e=20
would get back to me in two hours or so after her meeting on another matter.

Authorized Traders List:  Stephanie had originally taken on this task and=20
sent me an email indicating that the list was complete.  Last week, Stephani=
e=20
indicated that the information upon which she relied was no longer in the=20
database.  Therefore, there is some confusion as to who the corporate=20
officers are.  I called Richard Sage, with whom Stephanie has been in=20
contact, for assistance.  He has not called me back so if you had further=20
suggestions on how to proceeed, please let me know.

Account & Tax Forms: I have the requisite form -- the same one I have used=20
for the same tasks for other new Enron entities - in my possession and am in=
=20
the process of filling them out. =20

Logistics: You indicated in your voice message that you were not sure whethe=
r=20
I had thought logistically about getting the agreement executed.  Let me=20
reassure you that I have.  In light of the above, I did not maintain the vie=
w=20
that all the documents would be ready for signature by noon particularly=20
because (1) we do not have in our possession final versions of two of the=20
three agreements and (2) I determined on Friday that the Authorized Officers=
=20
List might now be outdated.  I received some emails today disclosing how to=20
proceed re: sending the document.  However, as I confirmed with you on=20
Friday, I spoke with Mike Bruegel on Thursday and confirmed where to send th=
e=20
documents.

When you are available, please let me know so we can update and resolution o=
n=20
how to proceed on any outstanding matters.
