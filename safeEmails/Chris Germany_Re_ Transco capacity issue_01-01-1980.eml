The name is PPL ENPLUS which I believe is short for PPL Energy Plus.  I=20
purchased 4,752 dt on TRANSCO.  The primary receipt point is CNG-Leidy and=20
the primary delivery point is Mainline BG&E.  The offer number is 21575-001.

I feel comfortable that the points listed above are the primary receipt and=20
delivery points because of our relationship with Penn Fuel.  Following is th=
e=20
example Judy and I discussed with Transco.


EXAMPLE
Assume PSE&G has 100,000 dt of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery=20
point of PSE&G, downstream of Linden.  ENA purchases 20,000 dt of telescoped=
=20
capacity from PSE&G under the following scenarios;

1.PSE&G released the capacity with PSE&G as the delivery point.
ENA has primary rights of 20,000 to PSE&G and secondary rights of 20,000 to=20
New York (no change, same as before).

ENA could flow 20,000 from the Gulf to BG&E (upstream of the Linden and the=20
Leidy Line) on a primary basis.  AND 20,000 from Nat Fuel-Leidy to PSE&G=20
which is secondary on the Leidy Line, and Primary on the mainline to PSE&G. =
=20
AND 20,000 from Tenn-Rivervale to BUG on a secondary basis.  These paths are=
=20
not overlapping and ENA could effectivly schedule

Colleen/Chris:  I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the=20
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list=20
the primary receipt and delivery points.  However, in checking the FERC web=20
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers=20
quarterly.  Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirement=
s=20
won't be out until early October.  I will look into this more closely when I=
=20
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee?  I couldn't find=
=20
"Penn Fuel" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of=20
7/1/00.  Do they have another "legal" name?

P.S.  Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees. =20
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100.  But I understand y'all will=
=20
have a cool spell tomorrow.  It's supposed to be way down to 92!!  We'll be=20
warming up to about 72. =20

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more=20
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we=
=20
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the=20
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would=20
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the=20
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the=20
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt=
=20
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it=
=20
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impac=
t=20
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let=20
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
