We had a bad accident at the construction site on Friday.  A construction wo=
rker slipped and fell in front of a bulldozer.  Over the weekend he had his =
foot amputated.  We have flown his family in and put them up at a Ronald Mcd=

think this will materially delay closing the sale to Black Hills, but we wil=
l likely need to indemnify them from the litigation risk associated with thi=
s accident.  We are working with legal and insurance to assess risk and proc=
