Rudy-
Per our conversation today, the invoice for the "Hilli" delivery will be due=
 no earlier than May 17,  2001.  If under normal payment terms the invoice w=
ould be due later than May 17, then the regular due date would prevail.

Thanks for your help,
Dan Masters

I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the "Hi=
lli" be extended.  Since the delivery is earlier than Eco needs the product,=
  they would request that the invoice be due on May 17.  Please advise if th=
is is agreeable.

Thanks,
Dan Masters
