Hey there -- hope the weekend was good.  I think I will still plan to come -=
-=20
as I can handle some of my personal things re: moving home -- house etc.  on=
=20
Thursday Friday and meet up with others on Wed.

So ---- go ahead and pencil me in for Mon and Tuesday the 13th and 14th.

I will assume that you and Patti will mostly fill my calendar on those two=20
days, so will have Janine put other meetings the rest of that week.

Will check on the agenda next week, before I leave London.

Thanks

Beth

The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in Sa=
n=20
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling=20
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that=20
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to=20
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that=20
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look=20
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team. =20

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston. =20

Have a great weekend.  --Sally=20

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very=20
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is=
=20
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects=20
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally=20
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is=20
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing=20
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come=20
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your=
=20
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as yo=
u=20
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in=20
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to=20
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE=20
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time wit=
h=20
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth
