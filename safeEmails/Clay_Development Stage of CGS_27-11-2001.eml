We are beginning the development stage of our Consolidated Gas System - Repo=
rting project and we need to get more detailed information about the locatio=
n of data that is being pulled in WeaponX presently.  The majority of the re=
ports we have been able to locate in ERMS but there are a couple where the d=
ata has not been found.  We need to map the present location of the data to =
ensure all information will be in the new system.  We would also like to go =
through a calc (step-by-step) to ensure all necessary pieces will be include=
d in the new system.

We are requesting one representative from Risk Management be present to answ=
er a few questions.  A data architect and a developer will be present to ask=
 necessary questions to get off to a good start.  Please let me know who wil=
l be available from the Risk side.

Thank you.
