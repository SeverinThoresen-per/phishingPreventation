  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panel=
ists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--=
Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Pow=
er Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Stev=
e Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from ti=
me to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in que=
stioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial =
presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was s=
ome reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, t=
here was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission ri=
ghts.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Plan=
ning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are =
problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that e=
xpansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a go=
od deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identification of opt=
ions which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backsto=
p authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays fo=
r it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system ope=
rator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They we=
re formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million as=
set base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of invest=
ment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects=
 all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines =
requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea o=
f joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, a=
lthough FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by=
 FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must =
be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when c=
onsidering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems wi=
th their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning proces=
s which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the =
future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is=
 the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and reso=
urces.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs=
 a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market sho=
uld decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked a=
bout hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we hav=
e now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken c=
onflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answere=
d are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission p=
rojects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansion=
s? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to s=
ettle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has=
 frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 yea=
rs or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there need=
s to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You ar=
e always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV l=
ine is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-o=
f-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In or=
der to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute reso=
lution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current conge=
stion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  =
Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built wi=
th the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use =
of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this=
 is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of=
 the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they c=
an make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and n=
eeded lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmissio=
n planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities=
=2E  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the pr=
ocess.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laur=
a Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not having =
proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't=
=2E  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure =
of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not=
 to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model b=
ut LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but=
 given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "tweaks" l=
ike bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  riv=
er coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize f=
irm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not =
70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thin=
g as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base lo=
ad coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) =
RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO sho=
uld be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was=
 over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was criti=
cal and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators invol=
ved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it=
 provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is =
based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point re=
ally comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension w=
hich exist because unbiased and accountability issues.
