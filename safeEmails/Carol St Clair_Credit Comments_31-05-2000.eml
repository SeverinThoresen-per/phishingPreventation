Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Ro=
d=20
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default=20
provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and=20
second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that. =20

2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for=20
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to=20
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps). =20
Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do=
=20
more with netting across product lines.

4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to=20
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.=
 =20

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules an=
d=20
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.
