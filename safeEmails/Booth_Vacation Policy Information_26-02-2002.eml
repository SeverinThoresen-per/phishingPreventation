EA Estate Group:

Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, a=
nd scheduling policy:

Vacation Eligibility:
All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuou=
s service.  Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid va=
cation per year.  Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation.

Vacation Allowance:
Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to=
 the following schedule.  Employees must be on the payroll and actively at w=
ork as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation fo=
r that month.  If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, =
causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation =
accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will =
accrue vacation for the month.  (For example, an employee with a hire date o=
f January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998.  The=
 intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explai=
ned; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of=
 employment.)

For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 week=
s (160 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per=

ll complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, p=
er the schedule above, except for the hire year.
