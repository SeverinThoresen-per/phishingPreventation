Steve,

Attached is the source code and documentation for the VNG Gas Control websit=
e. This is the last outstanding item needed as part of the agreement. I have=
 changed all references to Enron on VNG.SEQUENTENERGY.COM and refer them as =
SEM or Sequent. I will be available if you have any questions.

Cheers,
