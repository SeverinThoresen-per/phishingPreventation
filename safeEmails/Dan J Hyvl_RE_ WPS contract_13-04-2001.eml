Kim,
 Stacy (Dickson) Granmayeh has reviewed the proposed Master Contract that yo=
u=20
drafted for enovate, L.L.C. and I have likewise reviewed the proposed Master=
=20
Contract that you forwarded to Enron North America Corp.

 As I indicated earlier, these contracts are similar to the contract we=20
started with last year in documenting the transaction that was ultimately=20
entered into.  I recall providing a copy of our Sample Enfolio Master Firm=20
Purchase/Sale Agreement together with the credit departments requirements=20
which they required in order to enter into the transaction.  I am told that=20
those credit requirements relating to triggering events and collateral=20
threshold will also be necessary before Enron North America Corp. can enter=20
into a transaction this year.

 Unless I specifically state that a comment relates to enovate or to Enron,=20
these comments relate to both entities.

 1. The correct name for enovate is:  enovate, L.L.C.

 2. Change the Confirming Party in Section 3.12 to Seller.

 3. Section 4.1 needs to be altered in such a way to make the verbal=20

=20
any agreement between the Parties is not binding until a Transaction=20
Confirmation is executed by both Parties.

 4. The word "Contract" in Section 5.1.1.b. should be changed to=20
"Transaction".

 5. The concept of "Point(s) of Receipt" and "Point(s) of Sale" need to be=20
collapsed into Point(s) of Delivery at which point title and possession is=20
transferred from the Seller to the Buyer. No need for two separate concepts.

 6. Delete Sections 6.5 and 6.6 in their entireties.

 7. Alter Section 8.3.3 concerning Locked Prices in such a way to make the=20
Locked Prices binding at the time of the phone call; not upon the passage of=
=20
48 hours for receipt of confirmation.

 8. The term "Commodity Charge Index Adjustment" used in Section 8.1, 8.2 an=
d=20
8.3 needs to be defined.

 9. The first sentence of Section 10.3 should be altered to delete the last=20
phrase =01&of the negligence of the other Party=018 and include the followin=
g=20
phrase in its place:  =01&the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad fa=
ith=20
of the other Party.=018
=20
 10. Delete the phrase =01&(not via facsimile)=018 from the first sentence o=
f=20
Section 12.1.

Transaction Term=018 in Section 16.1.b.

 13. Add the following sentence to the end of Section 16.1.e:  =01&Party fai=
ls=20

 14. Delete the third sentence of Section 16.2 in its entirety.

 15. Delete Section 16.3.d in its entirety.

 16. The Corporate Guarantee in Section 19 should be a payment guarantee not=
=20

 17. With regard to enovate, change =01&Wisconsin=018 to =01&Illinois=018 in=
 Section=20
21.5; and with regard to Enron, change "Wisconsin" to "Texas" in Section 21.=
5.

 18. Section 21.7 requires =01&mutual execution of an appropriate supplement=
al=20
written Transaction Confirmation=018 for an effective modification.  This=20
