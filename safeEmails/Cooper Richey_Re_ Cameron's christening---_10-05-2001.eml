Great.  Thanks Camille.

I get into Nashville on 10:16 on friday night and my flight leaves at 2:25 o=
n Sunday. =20

Sounds like the christening schedule will fits perfectly into that.  It's ex=
citing that Cameron's
christening will be in front of everyone!

See you soon.

Cooper

Hey Cooper,

Just wanted to let you know that I spoke w/Chaplain and Cameron's
christening will be at the beginning of the church service (9am).  The
service will be over by 10:15 or 10:30.  This should give you plenty of
time to get to the airport for your 2:40(?) flight.  I also reserved
rooms for you and your parents for both Fri & Sat nights.  Friday you'll
be in Nashville and Saturday you'll stay in Clarksville.  Anyway, just
wanted to pass this info on to you.  Hope you are doing well and not
working too much.  Look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.

Camille

PS--Cameron's very attached to the bumble bee you gave her for
Christmas.  She has to take it to school and music class.
