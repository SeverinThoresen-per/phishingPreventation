A quick summary on where ENW is relative to NetCo and the Estate.
=20
Some quick numbers first (all numbers are exclusive of the pipelines and Ste=
ve Hotte's group). =20
=20
We will have about 117 employees remaining in the estate on the application =
side (Perlman) after about 100 go with NetCo.  We will have 121 employees re=
maining with the estate on the infrastructure side (Rub for now) after 60 go=
 with NetCo.  We will have 9 on estate EOL IT (that will end up with the est=
ate application group) after 40 go with NetCo.  We will have about 48 from E=
A operations (Hall) remaining with the estate after about 170 go with the Ne=
tCo.  We will have a few EOL operations people after about 40 go with NetCo.=
  We also have individuals remaining on the operations side for EGM and EIM =
under Kevin Sweeney.  We also have estate employees under Dayao with EES IT =
who have gas and power skills as well as EES operations people under Beth Ap=
ollo.  These numbers are all fluid and are not final as the NetCo deal and t=
he people associated with it ebb and flow.  Currently, the estimate for ENW =
employees going to NetCo from all IT, operations and EOL operations is appro=
ximately 410.  Remaining in the estate to support non-pipeline IT and operat=
ions is approximately 453.
=20
As we discussed this morning, we are trying to determine if the approximatel=
y 453 remaining ENW employees are the right number of people for the estate =
(EA, EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, Corp, etc.) for IT and operations as well as if the=
y are the right people period.  We have draft org charts for estate infrastr=
ucture and estate application and are doing a skill set review of the employ=
ees in IT who are slated to stay with the estate but until NetCo is a done d=
eal and the estate wholesale unit finalizes business plans, most of the IT e=
state people will be a pool of resources supporting both efforts.  Also, eve=
ryone in ENW knows which list they are on.
=20
Also, we have spent money on additional hardware and a particular Unify lice=
nse now (did it through Bowen and Weil as ordinary course) so that effective=
 duplication of all wholesale applications can be completed hopefully by the=
 end of January.  Therefore, the plan is to split ENW people out the day a N=
etCo deal gets done, split ownership of hardware the day a NetCo deal gets s=
igned, agree that NetCo owns all the IP with all the Enron developed applica=
tions and they get a complete copy and the estate has a free license back in=
 perpetuity and gets a copy of the same set of applications the day a deal g=
ets done. We will get that duplication of all those applications done by the=
 end of January (target date anyway). We will also begin a 6 month services =
agreement the day a deal gets signed.  Even though we will do the above, Net=
Co will still have their hardware and their applications sitting on that har=
dware initially in estate data centers (34 ECN, 9 ECS and Ardmore) and NetCo=
 will also be on the estate network.  Hopefully NetCo will transition off th=
ose in that 6 months, hence the need for the services agreement.
=20
We also submitted a 2002 cash budget to Corp. based on our estimate of remai=
ning headcount, licenses, etc. but until we see what it is we are supporting=
, it is a placeholder.
=20
Your thoughts on this?
=20
Continue to include Sally in all your meetings if possible so she can coordi=
nate the right support across your complete wholesale efforts going forward.
=20
Thanks.
