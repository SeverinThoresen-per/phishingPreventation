SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Senate committee investigating possible price gouging in=
=20
California's energy market voted unanimously Wednesday to ask the full Senat=
e=20
to find Houston-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with =
a=20
subpoena for documents.=20
The decision came despite Reliant's last-ditch offer to turn over 10,000=20
documents under a contingent confidentiality agreement that the Senate Selec=
t=20
Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation rejected.
"I'm not just trying to buy time," said Reliant attorney Charles J. Stevens.=
=20
"We believe we have acted cooperatively. We believe we have a good-faith=20
legal dispute."=20
"It's clear you're trying to work with us. It's not contempt with contempt,"=
=20
agreed committee Chair Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana.=20
By contrast, Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, blasted Reliant's "shoddy=20
behavior" before backing what he termed "a legally unprecedented step."=20
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant, it will be the first=20
time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a=20
committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations=20
involving cement sales to the state.=20
There are no set penalties, said committee special counsel Laurence Drivon.=20
By law, "the Senate can take such action as it deems necessary and=20
appropriate."=20
The contempt citation will be presented to the Senate Thursday, but will=20
immediately be sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the=20
full Senate acts, Dunn said.=20
He said the committee had no choice but to seek the sanctions and likely=20
force a court battle after it was unable to reach agreement with Reliant ove=
r=20
the confidentiality of its documents. The committee voted 6-0 in favor of th=
e=20
contempt finding.=20
"If we reach agreement on these issues, the process would be terminated=20
immediately," Dunn said.=20
In that light, the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week=20
against Enron Corp. after the company and committee moved closer to agreemen=
t=20
over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas.=20
Enron sued the committee last week to stop the subpoena of its financial and=
=20
electricity trading records. Among its objections are that only the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate wholesale=20
markets.=20
Reliant, like Enron, had argued the company's financial papers are outside=20
the committee's jurisdiction because most of its operations and paperwork ar=
e=20
outside California.=20
Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. also at least temporarily avoided a contempt=20
citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents. The committee will=20
review both companies' compliance in 30 days.

Calif. Senate Panel Votes To Cite Reliant With Contempt

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to=20
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to=20
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in=20
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.=20
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) t=
o=20
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the=20
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or=20
incarceration of executives.
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the=20
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear=
=20
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said.=20
"If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic=20
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to u=
s=20
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the=20
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words.=20
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago,"=20
Dunn said.=20

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting=
=20
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market=20
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's=20
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet=
=20
those demands, Dunn said.=20
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senat=
e=20
vote if either generator agrees to its requests.=20
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate o=
n=20
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rule=
s=20
Committee for review before a floor vote.=20
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rule=
s=20
Committee, but he will "certainly push them to do it as soon as possible."=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company "will continue to negotiate"=20
with the committee.=20
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't=20
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and=20
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit=20
Southern California Edison before leaving.=20
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt=
=20
charge.=20
"We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day=
=20
we get back from recess," Dunn said.=20
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment.=20
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity=20
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested=20
information.=20

SAN DIEGO, July 18 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Wednesday it has=

developed technology to connect thousands of miles of underused high-speed=20
fiber-optic cable to buildings across the U.S. by inserting the cable=20
directly into existing natural gas pipelines.=20
Sempra said using its utility's gas lines - which hook up to buildings in=20
cities throughout central and southern California - could tackle the=20
telecommunications industry's "last mile" problem connecting end users to=20
outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up city streets.
The surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunication=

companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic=20
systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than=20
traditional copper wires.=20
"Demand for broadband service in metropolitan areas is greater than ever,"=20
said Donald Felsinger, group president of Sempra Energy.=20
"The most significant obstacle to meeting that demand is the laying of=20
fiber-optic cable under city streets - traditionally a slow, costly and=20

Sempra Communications' new technology encases fiber-optic cable in a=20
protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same=20
pipelines that carry gas to utility customers, saving time and leaving=20

Sempra said companies that use the technology could see savings up to 30=20
percent on last mile costs compared to traditional methods of using older=20
technologies and digging up streets, said Jennifer Andrews, a spokeswoman at=
=20
Sempra Fiber Links, a new unit set up to market the technology.=20
Andrews said the company had already met with 15 gas utilities and five=20

California Public Utilities Commission for approval to use the fiber-optic=20
technology in its lines.=20
SCG is one of the largest gas distribution companies in the United States,=20
serving around 18 million customers in Central and Southern California.=20
In a statement, Sempra Communications said installing the cable does not=20

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001--Fitch has assigned a 'BBB' rating=20
to Marlin Water Trust II and the Marlin Water Trust II Co-Issuer's (Marlin=20
II) $475 million issuance of 6.31% senior secured notes due 2003, and $515=20
million 6.19% senior secured notes due 2003.=20
The notes are issued domestically pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and outside the=20
U.S. under Regulation S. At closing net proceeds from the issuance will=20
temporarily be invested in two short-term Enron Corp. (Enron) notes.
Ultimately the proceeds from the repayment of the Enron notes will be used t=

redeem the outstanding $830 million 7.09% senior secured notes due 2001 of=20
Marlin Water Trust (Marlin) and pay interest on the senior notes and yield o=
n=20
the Marlin trust certificates. The support for the rating comes from an=20
overfund account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron in=20
the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The overfund account=20
will be invested in Enron debt securities (rated 'BBB+', Rating Outlook=20
Stable), with payments used to service interest to noteholders.=20
Fitch considers the cash flow stream to repay interest representative of a=20
'BBB+' credit profile. Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron's=20
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities. Fitch=20
currently rates Enron's preferred securities 'BBB-'.=20
Enron established Marlin to facilitate off-balance sheet financing of the=20
acquisition of Wessex Water Plc (Wessex). Azurix, an indirect wholly owned=20
subsidiary of Enron, acquired Wessex in October 1998 for $2.4 billion throug=
h=20
its direct subsidiary Azurix Europe Limited (AEL). Through a series of=20
transactions, Enron contributed its ownership interest in Azurix to Atlantic=
=20
Water Trust (AWT) in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in AWT. At the=20
same time, Marlin acquired a 50% ownership interest in AWT with proceeds fro=
m=20
the original Marlin issuance of senior notes ($1.15 billion) and trust=20
certificates ($125 million). AWT applied the Marlin notes and certificates=20
proceeds to repay a $900 million acquisition bridge loan and to establish a=20
$249 million overfund account invested in Enron senior unsecured debt to pay=
=20
note interest and certificate yield. In addition, Enron contributed to AWT=20
its rights under a $125 million loan to AEL (rated `BBB+').=20
Both the AEL note and the Enron debt securities are held at Bristol Water=20
Trust (Bristol) for the benefit of Marlin investors. In June 1999, Azurix=20
completed an initial public offering of 33% of the company, proceeds of whic=
h=20
were used to partially redeem the Marlin senior notes. In a shift in strateg=
y=20
in March 2001, Enron repurchased the Azurix shares held by the public. The=20
Marlin II transaction represents a refinancing of the remaining Marlin senio=
r=20
notes. While various sources of repayment for the Marlin II notes are=20
available, such as sale or liquidation of the AWT assets, an equity offering=
,=20
or repayment of the AEL note, primary credit support is derived from the=20
Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock.=20
If an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the=20
trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a Note Trigger Event, th=
e=20
indenture trustee will direct the share trust to sell the Enron preferred=20
stock on terms that are designed to generate an amount sufficient to redeem=20
the notes in full.=20
In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the=20
amount required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to deliver=20
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation,=20
then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron,=20
representing a general unsecured claim. Trigger events include: an event of=20
default on the Marlin II notes occurs and notes are accelerated; 120 days=20
prior to maturity if the repayment amount of the senior notes has not been=20
deposited with the indenture trustee as a result of the sale of Enron equity=

or other equity (which may include the mandatorily convertible preferred=20
stock); or, downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grad=
e=20
by Fitch, S&P or Moody's in conjunction with a decline in Enron's closing=20
stock price to below $34.13 over three consecutive trading days.=20
The Marlin transactions provide Enron with an efficient vehicle to monetize=20
its investment in Wessex and effectively accelerate the process for capital=20
redeployment. Fitch does not expect the success or failure of AWT asset sale=
s=20
to materially impact Enron's consolidated credit quality. Currently, Enron's=
