Hey there -- Life sounds horribly busy.  I figured it was.

Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since=20
now I have officially been replaced, and it has been announced to my direct=20
reports here in London.   Fernley (not sure if you have spoken to him)  is=20
anxious to put an announcement out to Enron Europe that Phillip Lord and I=20
are leaving and that Melissa will be stepping in to replace us.
Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at=20
least say that I am going to North America Energy Ops, or something -- even=20
if we don't have all of the details worked out.

I am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial "=
=20
customers"  --- also  - I have never met Delainey (I don't think)  -- but=20
maybe knowing Frevert well is enough.  I am planning to come in November=20
(first half) to work on Europe's plan and coordinate with Brent, Wes and the=
=20
other groups under Frevert, so maybe I can meet some people then.  Would lov=
e=20
to discuss

Monday is fine -- as I am sure today will be another crazy day.

I know how all of those reviews are.  John Sherriff put a o5 per review per=20
day penalty on any dept head who didn't have their reviews  done by August=20
15th, and of course I was on holiday the week before that, so I had 2 days t=
o=20
do 10 reviews.

Hopefully I can help you with that direct report problem.

If I don't talk to you today, then have a good weekend,=20

Beth

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got=20
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed=20
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30=20
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me=20
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could=20
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail=20
is much better. =20

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews=20
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff=20
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rat=
e=20
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished=20
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three=20
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three=20
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver=20
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the=20
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late=20
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be=20
MUCH better. =20

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love=
=20
to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you=
=20
from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday. =20
