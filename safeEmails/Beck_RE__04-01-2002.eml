Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Un=
der the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy=
 Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phras=
e "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  B=
ill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the c=
ompany regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration =
for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accou=
nted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally=20

The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global c=
