As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough=20
security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK=20
with this - but I'd be happier if it did not include "omission"

i.e. If we are stupid and hurt ourselves, then shame on us, but if we simply=
=20
do not take some action and thereby fail to prevent the Counterparty from=20
inflicting damage on us, then that is something different.

Thoughts?

Dave

Dave:
1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is=20
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't=
=20
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their=20
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own=20
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I=20
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided=20
nature of the indemnity language.

Couple of questions:

- What is the intention of the first paragraph?
- So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: "Counterparty is allowed to=20
whack us if we don't have high enough security"?
