Nancy,

When did you leave EBS?

 When you have a few minutes, I'd like to discuss how we are breaking out=20
internal business groups activity.  Specifically, my concern is with using=20
separate bank accounts for different commodities that are settled financiall=
y=20
within Enron North America Corp (legal entity).  We met with the financial=20
settlements group today to discuss credit issues surrounding settlements, an=
d=20
this emerged as one of the more important issues. =20

As you may be aware, the ISDA document calls for all payments that are due o=
n=20
the same day to be netted together.  If we use separate bank accounts, this=20
cannot happen.  There are two credit issues with not adhering to this: 1) if=
=20
we send payment to a cp for one commodity but do not receive the payment tha=
t=20
may be owed to us for another commodity, we have lost the ability to net=20
those payments, and will be at risk for the outgoing amount, and 2) in a=20
default situation, our position on close-out netting may be compromised if w=
e=20
have not been netting in practice.=20

 I am not sure how often this occurs in reality due to different settlement=20
dates for different products.  I also need to speak to Mark Taylor to=20
determine the likelihood of our legal position in court being compromised. =20
Can you help  me to understand why we need to have different bank accounts? =
=20
I understand that for internal reporting purposes, we need to use different=20
ledger accounts, but I would not think we would need to extend this to the=20
physical movement of cash.

Thanks for your help,
Tanya

Just FYI -=20

The note below indicates that all of the weather transactions that are=20
settling out of 0364 will now be settling out of 0460, thus using the new=20
bank account that has been set up for 0460.

Thank you,
Becky

Here are the accounting changes I received from Nancy for the migration of=20
the Weather group over to EGM.

Do you think it is possible for us to have all the changes made (in UNIFY,=20
GCP, etc...) so we are ready by the end of the first week in November?

All cash that is received and paid from ENA's cash services account related=20
to EGM will need to be redirected to the applicable account above and=20
coordinated with the any Global Counterparty changes as well.

There is also a BATX account on co 460.  The information is as follows:
GL Acct  Description   Account # Routing
12805051 ECT IES BATX Bank Acct 375143337 111000012

Receipts for EGM that went directly to co 364 should be redirected to co 460=
=2E

Laurel also mentioned  a Japanese Yen acct, a EURO acct, and Sterling acct=20
that exist on co 530 that will be transferred to EGM (co 1Y2?)  EGM will als=
o=20
require a CAD account to be set up (co 1Y2?)

Thanks Nancy

Subject: EGM settlements

In order to segregate EGM's business activity, it will be necessary to recor=
d=20
transactions related to EGM's business unit  on entities within its own=20
reporting rollup.  Currently, there is EGM settlement activity being booked=20
to the following companies that are outside EGM's rollup:

Co 364 - Weather Trading,Emissions=20
Co 54N - Emissions Trading
Co 967 - Weather Trading, Emissions Trading, Agricultural Trading, Interest=20
rate, FX

Going forward (effective November), monthly activity on Co 364 related to EG=
M=20
will be recorded on co 460, Co 54N on Co 460, and Co 967 on Co 1Y2.  In orde=
r=20
to make this a smooth transition, but still make the change in an timely=20
fashion, please give me your feedback on this as soon as possible.  Please=20
let me know your issues concerning A/R, A/P, Cash, Global Counterparty and=20
any other areas I may be leaving out.  I'll contact you on Monday to discuss=
=20
further and see if this is feasible.

It is also our intent to move ytd September balances related to EGM's=20
business to entities with in our own rollup.  This will probably be done at=20
the CS/Hyperion level.  Since there are October transactions already=20
recorded, we will probably make a general ledger reclass for October income=20
statement activity to EGM's rollup.  Please let me know if you have issues=20
with this as well.


Thanks!

Nancy
