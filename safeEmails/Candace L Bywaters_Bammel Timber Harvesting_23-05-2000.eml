Under separate cover I am having walked up to you a marked-up sample Timber=20
Management Agreement that the harvester we have chosen, Southern=20
Timbergrowers, Inc., offers as its standard document.=20

HPL has selected this harvester based upon their "full-service" program as=20
well as their reputation and their expertise.  However, we would like some=20
language in the Agreement concerning Agent's full disclosure to Client of th=
e=20
prices in the marketplace (I believe this is probably covered by the Agent's=
=20
responsibility to submit bids to Client for approval, but we would also like=
=20
Agent's forecast of prices to come so as to make the best decision possible=20
for optimum harvest revenues).  We would like to limit the first term=20
hereunder to one year, renewable upon mutual negotiation at which time we ma=
y=20
incorporate some type of incentive or penalty to further control the revenue=
s=20
from the harvest if we deem is necessary.  We would also contemplate the=20
Agent's services on counseling us and providing the seedlings we would desir=
e=20
to further populate our land out there for future harvesting as well as=20
present amenities.  Our desire is to create an ongoing relationship with the=
=20
Agent so that we may have a fairly steady revenue stream for this property=20
that would at least balance out the costs of continual seedling planting and=
=20
desirably a good deal better than that.

Please let me know when you may be free to discuss this as I would like to=20
meet with you or your designee to discuss these provisions at length.  I hav=
e=20
already notified Southern Timbergrowers that they are our selected agent so=20
we need to move along on this as quickly as possible.

Thanks, Gerald!
