How are you doing this morning? How did everything work out with the house a=
nd everybody looking at it?=20
Work is pretty boring today. I am trying to make a flow chart for the very f=
irst time. I'm using Visio to create the chart so it will take me some extra=
 time because I don't know what I'm doing.=20

I am so tired. I think it's because I haven't had any sugar in two days. Hop=
efully I will start to get used to this soon. I know it is going to be well =
worth the effort in the long run. I love you so much. Thank you for helping =
me get healthy. You are a wonderful person and I am so lucky to have you in =
my life. :)

I love you baby.=20
I miss you and I can't wait to see you tonight.=20

I Love You.=20

Craig.=20

P.S.=20
Did I mention that I LOVE YOU?? :)=20
