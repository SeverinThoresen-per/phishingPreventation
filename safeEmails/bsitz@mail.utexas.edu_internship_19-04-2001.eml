Hey Mr. South, how's it going?  Sorry to bother you but I just wanted to
tell you that I am no longer going to California at the end of May.  I will
I finish up my exams during the week of May 13th, so I could start anytime
after that week.  Just let me know whenever you find out about an
internship.  Thanks a lot!


Brandon
