Please see the two memos below.  What is your take on these agency=20
relationships?  It seems to me that it would be o.k. to do what Jeff Porter=20
is suggesting, just leaving them in CES' name until they can be transferred=20
to NPC...Maybe I'm missing something??

CES and CEM will still exist for awhile, maybe forever due to legal issues. =
I=20
wouldn't begin canceling anything as the Choice customers are still in CES's=
=20
name and we don't want any capacity returning or other problems. They should=
=20
begin to be transferred to NPC soon. Why don't you hold off for now. Larry=20
Friedeman (419/878-4760) is actually the last CES employee and can be reache=
d=20
in his Toledo office through 3/31/01. =20

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energ=
y=20
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know)=20
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM=20
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and=20
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??
