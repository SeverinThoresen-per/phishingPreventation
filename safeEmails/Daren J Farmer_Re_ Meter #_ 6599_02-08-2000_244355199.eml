 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day=20
which is a good deal.
=20
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and=20
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.

 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.

 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?
