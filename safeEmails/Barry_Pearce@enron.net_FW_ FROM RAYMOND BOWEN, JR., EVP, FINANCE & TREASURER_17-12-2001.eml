Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business =
expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after =
December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly =
upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary c=
ourse of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and enterta=
inment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will=
 be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expens=
es.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's cur=
rent financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and=
 former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up =
to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-p=
etition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders o=
f the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid=
 pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $=
15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We =
have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,=
000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision rel=
ated expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petit=
ion expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the cour=
t regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimbu=
rse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as w=
e can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee hav=
e not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual =
process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petitio=
n business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual revie=
w process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including t=
he total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to exp=
ensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.
