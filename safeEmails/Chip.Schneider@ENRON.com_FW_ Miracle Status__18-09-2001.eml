El Paso BOD killed due to capital sourcing uncertainty.  They have asked for=
 an option until the midle of Feb.  Makes sense to evaluate versus an auctio=
n.  In the meantime we do need to send a call notice for their LP interest o=
n Monday.

I believe that an auction will likely result in more litigation from Brazos =
but that might be a risk we are willing to take.  Don Miller noted yesterday=
 that auctions (which were already seeing price deterioration) will possibly=
 evolve to include financing outs.  All depends upon the speed of a recovery=
 in the debt markets.

Chad-Please take the Cornhusker model we sent El paso and see what the NPV i=
s on a roll forward basis.  We need to see whether we have any value issues =
by giving el paso a call (ie does the npv accrete as we roll forward).

Duran is set to discuss with el paso today and we will make any go forward d=
ecisions after.
