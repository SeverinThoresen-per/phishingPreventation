Aleck,

You are exactly right -- disappointed but not at all surprised by the OEB's
extension.

You should know that I wrote very detailed briefing papers for Ambassador
Cellucci's initial visit to Toronto last June 27-28 on the power sector
opening issue.  I saw the briefing book upon his arrival for the visit and
the Ambassador had heavily underlined it.  I also spoke with him about the
issue at length during our drive down to Buffalo.  In other words, the
Ambassador is thoroughly briefed on the matter.  I also took the opportunity
at the evening reception following the Board of Trade breakfast on June 28
(your Garrett Tripp was at the breakfast) to speak with Pennsylvania
Governor Tom Ridge about his providing moral support to Premier Harris on
moving ahead with the market opening. Ridge spoke to the Board of Trade
about his state's positive market opening experience.  Governor Ridge said
he would make the point to Premier Harris at the earliest opportunity.
Another interesting development was that the PAC's Commissioner during the
successful Pennsylvania opening -- a Mr. Quain, is now in private consulting
practice.  It would seem reasonable for the OEB to spend some money to hire
Mr. Quain to review their progress so far and perhaps make some helpful
suggestions.=20

Unfortunately, the Premier was not available for a meeting with the
Ambassador (Walkerton testimony was a day away) during that June visit.  I
hope that we can get this on a Premier/Ambassador meeting agenda at the
first opportunity.

By the way, I think the letter is excellently written, concise, and clearly
to the point.

Best, Mitch   =20

Mitch, I am sure we are all disappointed, but not surprised, by the
OEB's 4 month extension of the deadline for the filing by distributors
of their second self-certification report. I thought that you would be
interested in the comments that we filed with the OEB regarding the
proposed extension. That extension will effectively kill any possibility
of a market opening this year.  If you have any questions or comments,
please give me a call.
