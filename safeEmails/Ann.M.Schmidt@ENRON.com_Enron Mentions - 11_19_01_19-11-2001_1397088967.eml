It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inter=
est, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply disap=
pear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companies f=
rom Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company'=
s stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors bou=
ght the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock tanke=
d, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more attra=
ctive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stock pri=
ce failed to rise sufficiently, investors could "put" (that is, sell) the bo=
nds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion o=
ver the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at least =
half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. It =
simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back the =
first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible. Sud=
denly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook for bill=
ions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have to pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all, =
they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt c=
omes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bo=
ndholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into this c=
amp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money=
 anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are investors=
 in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer refinanc=
ing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the d=
ebt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at current depres=
sed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time when the econ=
omy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking. "This=
 is a ticking time bomb," warns Margaret Patel, manager of the Pioneer High =
Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started =
to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling s=
tock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bonds=
 presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to make c=
ash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead issuers =
offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond for $=
700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed nu=
mber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion woul=
d make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, by m=
ore than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premium), =
zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their stoc=
k prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swept away=
 into equity. "If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everybody," s=
ays Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at Deutsche =
Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If =
it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply s=
ell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot for=
 the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that happen=
ing? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go up," s=
ays Cohen. "They don't worry about the bond getting put."=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life ex=
ample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 billi=
on in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company's =
stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opinion =
of company management. "We really didn't want to sell equity at that point,"=
 says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the company =
instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise sig=
nificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scream=
ing buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could sel=
l the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price, e=
liminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has sin=
ce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense.=
 So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in borr=
owed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. There'=
s also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing rate co=
uld run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in cash. =
"Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down," Kelly says. "I don't t=
hink there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is=
 straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a finan=
cing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the wor=
ld," notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Stanley=
=2E The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit rati=
ngs out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convertible=
-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into=
 the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings downgrade=
d before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 percentage=
 points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pricey prop=
osition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high p=
rice of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy=
 back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over the n=
ext couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company was=
 recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if Sole=
ctron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, a situ=
ation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of millions of=
 dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Compa=
nies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of the =
amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions for w=
hat essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They're getting bad advice," c=
laims one banker who didn't want to be named. "Look at the fee the banker ea=
rned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can a=
lso get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% are=
 bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed share=
s with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same time =
that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money from =
their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to stock. =
This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at least fo=
r a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% of its ma=
rket cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continue=
s, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provi=
de. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of =
financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies can r=
ake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're actually=
 paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if ce=
rtain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would pay 0.=
25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls=
 below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS, oddly, t=
hat clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction, for tax =
purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Why? Trust us=
, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction of more than =
$200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in interest. Not surpr=
isingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses.=
 "It's an incredible deal for them," says Vadim Iosilevich, who runs a hedge=
 fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they raising cheap m=
oney, they're also doing tax arbitrage."=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue z=
eros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, total=
ing $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power of t=
he tax advantage is going to keep them around," says CSFB's Seidel. Call it =
greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it doesn=
't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left paying th=

Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of =
age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucen=
t, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMG=
I), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.=
 The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a propos=
ed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became=
 a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of confli=
cts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with sc=
hadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage=
=2E
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. =
We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is nee=
ded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. =
But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revela=
tions emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have e=
nduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric po=
wer industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding=
 by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. Enron=
 was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is s=
preading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consumers=
, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition force=
 the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experience =
of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the power ind=
ustry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the old reg=
ulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a one=
-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible and =
inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by t=
he truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact =
needs of the customer.=20
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent =
parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered cus=
tomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did too,=
 because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguably, E=
nron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the "proce=
ss of Creative Destruction." But creative destroyers are not necessarily lik=
able, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logic=
 of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for ins=
tance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amounts=
 to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activi=
ties better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrated fi=
rms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy=
 and the captive nature of "customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisioned cre=
ating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet tha=
t the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal operation=
s. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which division=
s of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the ec=
onomy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment,=
 natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipe=
line. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a numbe=
r of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competition, =
and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies. Enro=
n benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they could nim=
bly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in t=
ime to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules to elect=
rons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous v=
alue for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easily=
 have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading=
 risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron pi=
oneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the be=
st anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron made =
new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential to hav=
e up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and ability=
 to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by t=
he firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to fina=
nce its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfolios =
are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thick e=
quity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than trading =
risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporate=
 culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a util=
ity company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excuses=
=2E And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years a=
go -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean, fa=
st, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving its pr=
ofessionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, and tra=
nsfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an open=
-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture w=
as by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a larg=
e corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning rod =
for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more hide-=
bound enterprises to emulate.=20
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation=
 of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the busi=
ness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in wh=
ich it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establish=
ment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following Enr=
on's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming antitr=
ust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enron's=
 spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prosperity =
depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their indu=
stries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection =
contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jour=
nal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the three=
 months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during the t=
hird quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard & =
Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the sta=
r performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., SBC =
Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
"It has turned into a real stock-picker's market," says J.P. Morgan equity s=
trategist Douglas Cliggott. "In the first half, the market bought cyclical s=
tocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't th=
ink those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003." Instead, the =
firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, as wel=
l as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The t=
errorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses, w=
hich drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the market=
s have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the group=
 posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during the As=
ian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bosto=
n finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively. =
The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at co=
mpanies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Praecis =
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (down 51=
%).=20
For CSFB, "it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure," says A=
l Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. "It was our tech and t=
elecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portfo=
lio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has h=
urt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as tec=
hnology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy stocks =
to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett Co. S=
ays Mr. Jackson: "We are going back to our roots and asking what our best id=
eas are."=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compan=
ies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the quart=
er). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Corp. =
(down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rauscher, w=
hich placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on their=
 lists.=20
In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodgi=
ng giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and airli=
nes such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many securi=
ties firms.=20
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one =
time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how their =
portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Calcu=
lations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investment Re=
search in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends and =
theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consiste=
nt results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the year.=
 Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the to=
tal return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, Edwar=
ds Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few changes=
 to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20
"It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and st=
eady wins the race," says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. "We=
 are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting ric=
h, slowly."=20
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit of=
 Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. Ho=
wever, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't done =
as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45.9% =
in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whi=
ch posted a one-year loss of 54.9%.=20
Seven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, whi=
ch fell 26.6% in the period.=20
Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to it=
s heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this qua=
rter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in its=
 portfolio, known as its "Ten Uncommon Values." This time around, the firm's=
 portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just one =
of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positive retu=
rn, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp., which=
 fell 36.3% in the period.=20
"It's a portfolio that has done decently since the market troughed," says Je=
ff Applegate, Lehman's chief market strategist. He says he believes the mark=
et hit bottom Sept. 21.=20

German Bank Is in Talks With Enron To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

11/19/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from =
the Enron Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore =
assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its main=
 energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to Enron's decision earl=
ier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or West=
LB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discussio=
ns said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals like T=
hames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most like=
ly incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger on a=
ntitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) b=
ut less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts said=
=2E=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' K=
enneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a conf=
erence call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than we =
ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, of wh=
ich Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. West=
LB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for B=
ritish Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks con=
trolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under government s=
upervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stages.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wat=
er Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for New
By Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- cap=
ping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news ami=
d fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on plan=
ts, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big comp=
anies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Moto=
rs, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That is =
because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing boo=
m.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but be=
cause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, th=
ey are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate IOUs=
 used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lowest=
 -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporations.=
=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are use=
d to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $135 =
billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billion =
in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set a re=
cord, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-t=
erm commercial paper to long-term debt," says John Lonski, chief economist a=
t Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporation=
s sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But then,=
 companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations, =
a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990s=
=2E=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to =
the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the mil=
lions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly pay=
ments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance sheet=
s and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of course=
, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest borro=
wers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the biggest=
 refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in e=
xpiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off matu=
ring commercial paper by "rolling over" that debt, or issuing new commercial=
 paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much har=
der for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term credit=
 ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attractive =
rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives t=
o the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lines=
=2E "The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital market=
s," says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a deb=
t-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, hamm=
ered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downgra=
des, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay inv=
estors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an additiona=
l $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tiding it=
 over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have read=
y access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little trouble=
 selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bonds t=
otalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companies=
 are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money.=
=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings last=
 month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Ford=
 is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of the u=
ltraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning that =
it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes that =
a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial-=
paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he =
often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign o=
f eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. "You can't wait =
around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company]," he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so f=
ar this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to =
$1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end of l=
ast year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharply=
 as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to where =
they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff since=
 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive to=
 expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of 2.=
30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05%. =
In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage point t=
o 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 points=
 from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yiel=
d jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317, =
up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the =
U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed may=
 not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for Enron, the larger rival energy group, poses c=
omplex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regula=
tory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10 =
days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months to =
complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval of=
 the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's finances.=20
"It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming," said one person clo=
se to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed for=
 Ferc approval.=20
"(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc," s=
aid Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the asso=
ciation of US electric utilities.=20
"It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past, =
marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector as=
 it has become."=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer s=
aid approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two ye=
ars.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the ma=
rket power to push prices above competitive levels for "a significant period=
 of time".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers and=
 suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
"Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets," said Patt=
i Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consulting =
firm. "The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated."=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcula=
ted. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market po=
wer because information on the trading books of companies such as Enron and =
Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department o=
r the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have pip=
elines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C17
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervou=
s about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism wo=
rries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV late=
 last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%, a=
ccording to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & Poor=
's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the co=
untry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state insti=
tutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the "modern" rule=
s of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old manag=
er of the Russia fund.=20
"But they are getting more open," Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fina=
ncial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign i=
nvestors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests betwee=
n 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
"While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,"=
 Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is up =
10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to grow=
 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Europe.=
=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still t=
he most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications compa=
nies and breweries make up the rest. "There's no escaping oil and gas if you=
 want to manage a Russia fund," Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthwh=
ile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher o=
il prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely depe=
ndent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have threat=
ened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peopl=
e should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects. "=
You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Russia=
n oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuation,"=
 Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still trade=
 well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of t=
he fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more tha=
n 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companies s=
hould be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production, he=
 worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stock mar=
ket that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?" he asked. "The shor=
t answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged tha=
t weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas=
 into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer products.=
=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy colla=
psed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of it=
s value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished down =
almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value sto=
cks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the th=
ird quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its =
investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. The=
 largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. After=
 the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the wir=
eless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech com=
panies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, a =
unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company Enro=
n Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41.4 m=
illion shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s t=
hanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in so=
ftware company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investment=
 company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting a sm=
all position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usually mor=
e popular with price-sensitive "value" managers. Janus has introduced new va=
lue portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still follow fast=

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based e=
nergy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, wi=
thdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could tr=
igger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers provid=
ing liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to t=
he group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the takeo=
ver will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regula=
tory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company offic=
ials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and En=
ron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But ban=
kers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in th=
e energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron use =
derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20
Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 day=
s ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron's debt=
 to below investment grade.=20
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with Enron give Dynegy the ri=
ght to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' of=
ficials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull out.=20
While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with Enron are re=
luctant to lock themselves into long-term contracts to buy or sell power, sa=

Keith Stamm, chief executive of Aquila Inc., the energy marketing and risk-m=

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, th=
e most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL).=
 This apart, the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector in O=
rissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to adopt t=
he World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission and d=
istribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Committee ha=
s recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe it=
 helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set in =
Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the exp=
erience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom decid=
ed to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the ownersh=
ip and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the various=
 operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewildering=
ly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an indepen=
dent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor manag=
ement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious acci=
dents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The "reform" did =
not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeeding=
? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully separ=
ated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generation=
=2E AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating company=
, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea analy=
sed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was ina=
dequate and myopic."=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the =
companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defaul=
ted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn de=
faulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are now =
escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical purpos=
es, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, perhaps =
beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is =
less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingness =
to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cross=
 subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the household an=
d the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movin=
g to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" re=
gulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic pri=
ces but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, punish p=
ower thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is cut of=
f? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, sadly,=
 they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for substantive =
action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to get out!=
=20
Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over =
and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publicity=
 for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (see W=
orld Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enron's=
 misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic trading =
platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversification in=
 water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's exit. =
Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilling, ex-M=
cKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $1=
=2E2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge o=
f these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated w=
ith him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enron'=
s share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some reports =
that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anxi=
ous to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has b=
ecome even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are th=
e lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this is t=
he optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved, =
and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decision=
-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal does =
take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It is mu=
ch safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and Delhi t=
o allow the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", whateve=
r the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian politicians =
respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.
