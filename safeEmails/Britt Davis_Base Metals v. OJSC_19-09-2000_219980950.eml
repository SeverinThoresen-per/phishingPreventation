Richard,

I have just received and reviewed the pleadings file from our local counsel=20

PRODUCT

Richard,

This is to acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced new=
=20
matter, which concerns a third-party attachment of a load of aluminum worth=20
about $6 million and owned by MG Metals.  I read the file you gave me and=20
have spoken with Arthur Taylor, the in-house attorney for MG USA who was=20
monitoring this file, Tim Mullin and Scott Haiber, our outside counsel at=20
Miles & Stockbridge in Baltimore, and Martin Stanley, the London trader whos=
e=20
deal this was.  I will shortly be receiving a complete copy of Miles &=20
Stockbridge's correspondence and pleading files.  You have already sent to m=
e=20
various e-mails in this matter, which I understand that Martin had forwarded=
=20
to you.

      FACTS AND STATUS

Briefly stated, the significant facts are as follows.  On June 26, Base=20
Metals obtained an ex parte attachment order from the U.S. District Court fo=
r=20
the District of Maryland, Northern Division, for a cargo of aluminum=20
previously purchased by MG Metals from a third party and being discharged in=
=20
the Port of Baltimore.  Base Metals contends that the attachment was require=
d=20
because (a) the aluminum was actually still owned by OJSC, a Russian smelter=
=20
and the only named defendant in the underlying suit, or (b), that the=20
aluminum had been fraudulently conveyed to MG Metals.  However, MG Metals ha=
s=20
never been listed as a defendant in the case.  The aluminum was in fact=20
attached by Base Metals, per the order.=20

The underlying lawsuit by Base Metals, a trading company, against OJSC, the=20
Russian smelter, seeks to confirm an international arbitration award obtaine=
d=20
in Moscow late last year of approximately $12,000,000. That arbitration=20
reportedly arose out of the breach by OJSC of a long term output contract=20
between OJSC and Base Metals, pursuant to which Base Metals apparently had=20
the right to market most or all the production from OJSC.   That breach has=20
reportedly put Base Metals virtually out of business.  OJSC has reportedly=20
very recently been served by Base Metals with the Maryland federal lawsuit,=20
but has not appeared. =20

On July 7, the Court granted MG Metal's emergency motion to allow the sale o=
f=20
the aluminum, provided that the sale proceeds were placed into an interest=20
bearing escrow account.  Reportedly, all the previously-attached aluminum ha=
s=20
been sold, and approximately $2.5 million of sales proceeds have been=20
deposited into the escrow account. Additional sale proceeds are anticipated=20
to be deposited in the near future, with the total running in the range of=20
about $5.5-6 million.

On July 20, MG Metals served a motion to vacate the order establishing the=20
escrow account, and a request for an expedited hearing.  The first reason se=
t=20
forth in the motion is that Base Metals could not prove that OJSC owned the=20
metal, given that  MG Metals is shown as the shipper on the relevant straigh=
t=20
bills of lading, has all the necessary purchase and sale documents from an=20
intermediate buyer, and has reportedly paid fair market value to that=20
intermediate buyer for the aluminum.  The second reason is that MG Metals'=20
solvency obviates the need for an escrow account.=20

 Base Metals has filed a response, with supporting affidavits, contending=20
that the aluminum was fraudulently transferred to MG Metals,and that MG=20
Metals was actually aware of this.  This awareness allegedly arose at least=20
in part as the result of a warning from a representative of Base Metals to a=
=20
representative of MG Metals about the takeover of the Russian smelter throug=
h=20
a corruption of the Russian bankruptcy process by Russian competitors in the=
=20
metals business.=20
For strategy reasons, even though MG Metals advises that this conversation=20
never took place and that  all it was aware of were rumours that frequently=20
come out of Russia, MG Metals has not chosen to file affidavits controvertin=
g=20
its alleged knowledge.  This is because Base Metal's lead law firm in=20
Philadelphia is composed primarily of Russian immigrants and appears to be=20
tied to a law firm located in Russia.  Clearly Base Metals is better prepare=
d=20
than us to obtain information from Russia.  For that reason, we are trying t=
o=20
keep turning this case into a swearing match about what MG Metals knew was=20
happening in Russia by focusing on other arguments, such as the solvency=20
argument.

Along these lines, MG Metals will also shortly file a supplemental pleading=20
arguing that Base Metals failed to effect service on OJSC within the 60-day=20
time period allowed under the applicable Maryland attachment procedure,=20
voiding the attachment.  The service issue is not as strong as the solvency=20
argument,  as there is no Maryland law that holds that the failure to serve=20
process within the 60-day period on the defendant in the underlying suit is=20
in fact lethal to an attachment related to that suit.  Based on the solvency=
=20
argument, Miles and  Stockbridge believe that MG Metals has a better than=20
even chance of prevailing on its motion to vacate the escrow account.  =20

The Court's ruling on the attachment issue is obviously pivotal to us in thi=
s=20
matter.  I will report immediately once the Court rules.

Parenthetically, Mark Gately, the Miles & Stockbridge partner originally on=20
this file, has left that firm for the Baltimore office of Hogan & Hartson. =20
Martin has asked that the file stay with Miles & Stockbridge (the partner in=
=20
charge will now be Tim Mullen), and that Mark, who signed all the pleadings=20
and attended all the hearings to date as MG's first chair attorney, be used=20
as necessary, but that we not be charged for two law firms. In speaking with=
=20
Tim Mullin, the partner in charge now at Miles & Stockbridge, I am not sure=20
that he is aware of the last caveat re not being charged for two law firms,=20
although he mentioned that he would recommend that Mark be involved for no=20
more than one more hearing, after which his presence would not be necessary.

You should also be aware that Base Metals has filed proceedings to confirm=20
the arbitration award and attach aluminum from OJSC elsewhere in the U.S. =20
The aluminum involved in the other proceedings is not owned by MG Metals. =20
According to Martin, Base Metals (being virtually out of business) does not=20
have a lot of money to pursue litigation.

I would be grateful if Martin and/or Arthur would correct me if any of the=20
foregoing is in error. =20

With regard to further reporting, I understand that I am to keep you, Marcus=
=20
and Martin closely advised.  I am awaiting confirmation from Arthur that he=20
is agreeable to transitioning out of the file, under which circumstances he=20
will not be included in any future reports (and Arthur, if my understanding=20
is incorrect, just let me know).
