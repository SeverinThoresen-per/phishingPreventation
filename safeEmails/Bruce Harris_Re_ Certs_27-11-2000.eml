Bruce,
Donna provided to me copies of the Certificates.  They are in the name of :
PEP - PLENA ENERGIA PARTICIPACOES LTDA

Therefore, we would not be able to deposit them in an account set up for a=20
different entity, Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Inc. (entity name proveded=
=20
by Bruce Harris) at the prime broker. =20

The account at the prime broker is actually in the name of Enron Brazil Powe=
r=20
Holdings XII LTD. Per Morgan, this account was set up in 10/99 but has been=20
marked as inactive after a year.  They can open up with the completion of a=20
Form W-8BEN (Withholding form).  We still have the problem with how the=20
shares are actually registered.  I have a call into Morgan Stanley since PEP=
=20
is owned by Enron Brazil Holdings XII to see if we have any other options.
