Michelle,

Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternit=
y leave on October 15th.  During Kristin's absence, the following changes ha=
ve occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we com=
municate them to her:
1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (=
i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.  In=
stead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her=
 two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will stil=
l be the primary point of contact for ENA.  Specifically, Kristin will gathe=
r and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gath=
er and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for W=
est Power.  Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, j=
ust felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not=
 adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enou=
gh "face time" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as di=
recting her team. =20

Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contrac=
t for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this ha=
s happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.

Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these=
 changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fac=
t that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.  Additionally, we wou=
ld like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class s=
o that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, =
rather than micromanaging them.  Please let me know if this is going to crea=
te any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach. =20

As always, thanks for your help.
Anne
