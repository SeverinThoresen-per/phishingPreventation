> A man went into a pharmacy and asked to talk to a male

> The man said that it was something that he would be much

it

> The man agreed and began by saying, "This is tough for me

> problems and severe embarrassment. So I was wondering what you could give
me

> The pharmacist said "Just a minute, I'll go talk to my

> When she returned, she said, "We discussed it at length

> company car, and $3000 a month living expenses."
