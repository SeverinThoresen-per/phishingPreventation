Stacy,
 The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeare=
d=20
in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with=20
Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I=20
noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I=20
agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed=20
upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen=
=20
sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the=20
ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will=20
create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to m=
y=20
earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire.
