Praise the Lord,
Barb

Dear Friends,

Just a quick update to let you know that Charity did really well today
and the surgery went great.  Her wound was able to be fixed by bringing
the skin together.  We praise God that a skin graft was not needed!

The doctors are still talking about going home next week.  I'm ready.
Three weeks of hospital environment and food is plenty, plenty, plenty.

We continue to thank God for your prayers and support.  What an
unspeakable blessing you have all been to us.  We are truly indebted to
you.

PRAYER REQUESTS:

Please remember both Kathleen and Charity's eating.  Right now they are
being fed throuh a tube from nose to stomach.  The goal is to get them
off the tube and onto regular feedings by mouth.

Please also remember Vaneice, family, and me.  It has been a long haul.
We need the Lord Jesus to continue to carry us through.

Thanks,  God bless.

Greg
