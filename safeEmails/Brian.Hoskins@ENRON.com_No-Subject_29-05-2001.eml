Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years,=
 it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard B=
usiness School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you,=
 and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and futur=
e success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chanc=
e to say goodbye. =20

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10=
pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian
