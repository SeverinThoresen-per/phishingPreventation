Caroline,
As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to=20
obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the=20
assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been=20
duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a=20
perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to=
=20
us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1=
,=20
we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent=20
Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way=20
of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to poin=
t=20
#2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it=20
is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.

Please call or e-mail me, Sara or Frank if you have any additional questions=
=2E
