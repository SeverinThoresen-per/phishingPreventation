The damage recovery phase hasn't begun yet (we're still collecting repair=20
costs, and, at least until lately, Broadwing has still been cutting our=20
cable).  We will first try to settle with Broadwing, once we've tallied all=20
our damages.  If that doesn't work, our pending injunction suit also include=
s=20
a request for damages which the court would then hear.  David and Brad could=
=20
tell you better about the extent of our damages; I have a sense that it may=20
be about $400k, including a new reel of cable we need to install.  Those are=
=20
just the outside repair costs; we may be able to get employees' time,=20
attorney fees, and maybe (though unlikely) even some punitives or something=20
for lost reputation if we can prove our market share suffered.

ok thanks.  What is our strategy for recovering damages for the cuts to date=
=20
and how much do we think their cuts have cost us in re-construction efforts?=
