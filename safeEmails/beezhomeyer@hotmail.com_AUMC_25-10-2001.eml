Hi, Shelley.  As SPRC chair, I wanted to visit with you sometime over the
next couple of days about this janitorial situation.  Ernie supplied me with
the prototype letter you prepared, as well as your comments about the
independent contractor legalities, responsibilities, etc.  I could use your
advice on this subject to ensure the correct decisions are being made.
