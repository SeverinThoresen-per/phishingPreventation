Kenton,=20
                You are correct about my meeting with Bill Muckle (=20
Broadwing's Director of OSP Eng & Constr.)  in Rock Springs Monday and=20
Tuesday of next week.
They will have ten of their key field people there and we will have four of=20
our key servillance people, including Bill and Paul Beamis.  We will go over=
=20
accepatble construction and escalation procedures.  They are being  much mor=
e=20
careful than they have been in the past, even changing sides of the road in=20
tight right-of-way areas.  I'll update you after the meeting. =20

Steve, a week ago today, the judge denied our request for preliminary=20
injunction, but kept the proceeding open (so we can go back on an expedited=20
basis if we need to) and warned Broadwing that its many cuts were very gross=
=20
and that they should exercise extreme care ("digging with a hand trowel, if=20
you can," he said) as they continue their construction.  He also said that=20
they were facing some pretty significant damages, and that if they cut us=20
again he would probably issue an injunction.  He was concerned that future=20
cuts, after our system is lit, will generate much higher damage claims from=20
us.

If you want a little more detail, the judge ruled that we had met 3 of the 4=
=20
tests to get the injunction--likelihood of succeeding on the merits,=20
likelihood of suffering irreparable harm, and satisfied the public policy=20
protecting existing utility facilities.  But he found that on the 4th test,=20
the comparison of damages, that the damages B'wing would suffer if the=20
injunction were granted were similar to the damages we will suffer if it wer=
e=20
not granted, but the 30 or so menial construction hands who would be laid of=
f=20
by the contractors, if the injunction were granted, tipped the balance. =20

We knew that the chances of a shutdown were remote, and we were surprised we=
=20
came so close.  Our goal was to get the judge's help to make B'wing use safe=
r=20
construction practices, to avoid future cuts (which they have done:  they ar=
e=20
potholing now, constructing slower, and listening to our inspectors, althoug=
h=20
they still refuse to sign a Construction Coordination Agreement, which we've=
=20
repeatedly offered).  Our outside counsel and witnesses did a great job, and=
=20
the judge was very stern in his warning to Broadwing.  I think the Broadwing=
=20
people realize that  Broadwing did not "win" this proceeding, and that a=20
rather large hammer is now hanging over their head.

Next steps: I believe Brad is going to meet on-site with Broadwing's Bill=20
Muckle, to explore future steps to prevent future cuts.  We are keeping the=20
courthouse warm.  That's about it.

Please let me know if you'd like more info.

Kenton
