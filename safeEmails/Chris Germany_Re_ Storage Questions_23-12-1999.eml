Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking=20
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Poi=
nt
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload=20
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with=
=20
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking=20
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current=20
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks
