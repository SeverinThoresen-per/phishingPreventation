The recent revisions to the UCC Article 9 relate to the ability of counterpa=
rties to engage in receivable financings which could have the effect of defe=
ating the master netting concepts because it makes the restrictions on such =
actions included in the master netting agreement ineffective.  Prior law mad=
e prohibitions, but not restrictions, ineffective. I am in the process of ad=
ding some language to the form on which we are working to manage this issue =
(however, we will leave the restrictions in place as well for possible waive=
r arguments or further changes in future law).  In essence each of the parti=
es will take and perfect a security interest in its own potential obligation=
s to each of the other parties.  This will require UCC searches of our count=
erparties at the outset of negotiations to be sure we will hold a first lien=
=2E  It will require a downdate and filing as we consummate the netting agre=
ement.  To the extent you are in current negotiations, you may wish to condu=
ct the appropriate lien searches.  Rick Antonoff should coordinate the searc=
hes and filings for us.  If you have any questions, please advise.


Rick Antonoff, by copy of this memo, please prepare filings for the PGE mast=
er netting and the NewPower master netting to support the grants of security=
 interests to us in the amounts we owe them.  Each of these agreements inclu=
des this language in the security interest grants (6(b)). =20
1.  The New Power Company is incorporated in Delaware.  Provide me the form =
of proposed statement for review prior to filing.  We should make this filin=
g as soon as possible.  A copy of the final version is attached.
2.  As to PGE, I will verify with Lisa Mellencamp that it is ok to file on t=
he master netting agreement and the entities involved since they were not in=
 the bankruptcy (to my knowledge).  Once verified, I will let you know.  The=
 PGE parties are:  PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading,=
 Canada Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P., and CEG Energy, Option=
s Inc.  I do not have these entities states of incorporation.  Lisa at 853-7=
986 can get that information for you.  I do not have the final version of th=
is netting on line; if you need it, let me know.
