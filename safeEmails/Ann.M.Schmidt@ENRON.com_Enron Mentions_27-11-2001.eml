Enron and Dynegy Discuss Plan to Cut Price of Acquisition

Enron Corp., struggling to save its two-week-old deal to be acquired by Dyne=
gy Inc., was in advanced discussions with Dynegy to cut the price of the all=
-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion, according to people=
 familiar with the matter.=20
Beleaguered Enron also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity=
 dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis=
, these people said. Enron has total debt of about $13 billion. Increasingly=
, analysts are worried that the giant energy-trading concern's relatively fe=
w hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can't be used to support f=
urther borrowing.
Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. yesterday on=
 the New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the pa=
st few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a pr=
ocess that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a qu=
arterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, reve=
lations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move asse=
ts on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice res=
tated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy tra=
ding business is showing some signs of stress.=20
The move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement, and particularly to slash=
 the number of Dynegy shares that Enron holders would receive, only two week=
s after the pact's signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions=
=2E While terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments, tha=
t typically doesn't happen until a transaction is nearly completed.=20
Enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement yesterday =
that would calm its anxious investors, but the situation remained fluid thro=
ughout the day. As of yesterday evening, the revised deal still hadn't been =
formalized.=20
The deal is critical for Enron. In recent weeks, credit-rating agencies have=
 indicated they will refrain from further cuts to Enron's credit rating so l=
ong as a Dynegy purchase appears probable. But if that deal collapses, downg=
rades could occur that would put Enron below investment grade and in violati=
on of credit agreements with counterparties. This in turn could deal a savag=
e blow to Enron's commodity-trading business that is its lifeblood.=20
Negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of Houston ye=
sterday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban New Y=
ork where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal, which was annou=
nced Nov. 9. Both Dynegy and Enron declined to comment on the discussions.=20
One apparent sticking point in the talks was arriving at a new stock-exchang=
e ratio. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.26=
85 share for each Enron share tendered. Based on yesterday's New York Stock =
Exchange closing price of $39.25 for Dynegy shares, down $1.15, Enron holder=
s stand to receive $10.53 a share for their stock, or a total of about $9 bi=
llion.=20
People close to the discussions said the new ratio is expected to be less th=
an 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would va=
lue Enron at less than $6 a share, or about $5 billion.=20
Another contentious issue concerns the amount of additional capital Enron ne=
eds to shore up its finances. A week ago, the company disclosed it may have =
to post hundreds of millions of dollars or more to honor collateral calls be=
fore the end of the year. The problem for potential lenders is finding good =
assets to back these continued infusions of capital sought by Enron.=20
As part of the original merger agreement, Dynegy already has injected $1.5 b=
illion into Enron, receiving in exchange preferred stock in its Northern Nat=
ural Gas Co. pipeline system that runs from the upper Midwest to Texas. Unde=
r the agreement, if the acquisition falls apart, Dynegy "will have the right=
 to acquire 100% of the equity in the Northern Natural Gas subsidiary," thus=
 giving it "the full value of its investment."=20
But that arrangement is raising questions on Wall Street about whether credi=
tors are throwing good money after bad. Northern Natural Gas already is heav=
ily encumbered with debts. In addition to $500 million in unsecured public d=
ebt and $1.5 billion put in by Dynegy and co-investor ChevronTexaco Inc., a =
bank consortium led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. recently put in an additional=
 $450 million in cash backed by Northern's assets. The bank consortium also =
provided $550 million to Enron, against which assets of Enron's Transwestern=
 Pipeline Co. unit were pledged. This system, a network between Texas and Ca=
lifornia, is the only other domestic gas-transportation system fully owned b=
y Enron.=20
That brings total indebtedness to nearly $4 billion for two Enron pipeline s=
ystems that only generated transportation revenue of $77 million and $41 mil=
lion, respectively, in the third quarter. Enron's entire natural-gas pipelin=
e business, which includes two other partially owned systems, produced preta=
x earnings of $85 million for the third quarter, flat with the year-earlier =
period. Some observers said that if the Enron deal to be acquired by Dynegy =
falls apart, this could set the stage for a fight among the different classe=
s of creditors for a priority claim on the pipeline assets.=20

Fair Shares? Why Company Stock Is a Burden for Many -- And Less So for a Few=
 --- Workers Often Must Hold On To Stakes Held in 401(k)s; Top Brass Have Op=
tions --- Hedging for the `Upper Tier'
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

In the 1990s, as the stock market climbed year after year, many corporations=
 and their employees entered into a marriage of convenience: The company wou=
ld dole out its own shares as compensation and benefits. Employees would hav=
e a steadily appreciating asset that encouraged loyalty and created an incen=
tive to work hard for the company's success.=20
They're still doing it. Gillette Co., for example, "believes it is important=
 that employee interests be aligned with company interests," says spokesman =
Stephen K. Brayton, echoing the explanations of dozens of other companies th=
at use their own stock for executive pay, incentive bonuses, or contribution=
s to 401(k) retirement-savings accounts.
But as share prices have fallen over the past year and a half, it has become=
 clear that not all stock handouts are created equal. Millions of rank-and-f=
ile workers at hundreds of companies have found themselves shackled to big c=
hunks of company stock, while executives are able to exercise wide latitude =
in what they do with theirs. Because of the law capping tax-deductible execu=
tive compensation at $1 million a year, many companies top off their executi=
ve pay packages with stock options, as well as bonuses and other incentives =
that are typically paid in stock, much of it unencumbered.=20
Based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, hundreds of co=
mpanies use their own stock in lieu of cash as their matching contributions =
to employees' retirement-savings accounts. And the majority of those restric=
t the ability of employees to sell the shares and move the proceeds into mut=
ual funds and other alternatives offered through their 401(k)s. Benefits con=
sultants Hewitt Associates found in a recent study that nearly half of 215 f=
irms offering company stock in their 401(k) plans only contribute their own =
shares to employee accounts, and that 85% of those companies restrict sales =
of the stock.=20
Gillette doesn't let employees switch out of its stock contributions to thei=
r 401(k)s until age 50, according to government filings. At Coca-Cola Co., i=
t's age 53. Procter & Gamble Co., Qwest Communications International Inc. an=
d troubled Enron Corp. -- now facing lawsuits over employees' 401(k) losses =
-- are among the many others that impose similar restrictions. So far this y=
ear, Gillette employees have had to watch the company-contribution portion o=
f their retirement savings shrink by millions of dollars as the share price =
has fallen 11%. Employees at Coca-Cola have endured a share-price decline th=
is year of 18%. Procter & Gamble shares have been flat.=20
The companies point out that executives participate in the same 401(k) plans=
 as other employees, subject to the same restrictions. Still, the bulk of co=
mpany stock that executives own is usually held outside such restricted acco=
unts.=20
At Qwest, with a share price down 69% so far this year, top executives and d=
irectors have sold a combined $172 million of Qwest shares so far this year,=
 according to SEC data collected by Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. Qwes=
t Chief Executive Joseph P. Nacchio alone has sold Qwest shares valued at $8=
9 million.=20
Likewise, many companies offer supplemental savings plans for executives tha=
t don't force them to hold company stock. Some top executives at Coca-Cola c=
an participate in a supplemental retirement-savings plan with a guaranteed a=
nnual return of 14%. Executives at Qwest are able to contribute as much as 1=
00% of their salaries and bonuses to a supplemental plan in which they can a=
llocate their own and company contributions as they like.=20
Executives also can protect themselves -- without selling their shares and t=
riggering taxes -- by using hedging techniques offered for just that purpose=
 by firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Eaton Vance Corp. and Bessemer T=
rust Co. Disclosure of these deals to the SEC is generally required but spot=
ty.=20
"It clearly has been a growing business, and very busy in the last 12 months=
," says Michael Dweck, head of the Single Stock Risk Management division at =
Goldman Sachs. (The firms marketing these hedging strategies typically hedge=
 their own side of the transactions to protect themselves, as well.) "People=
 recognize the inherent risk of holding all your wealth in a single stock." =
His operation generally won't arrange transactions for blocks of stock worth=
 less than $5 million. "It's for the upper tier of management," Mr. Dweck sa=
ys.=20
For the rest, companies point out, employees have ample opportunity to diver=
sify their retirement-savings portfolios by investing their own contribution=
s in other options offered. Indeed, many workers have ill-advisedly put a lo=
t of their own 401(k) money into their employers' stock.=20
Wyn Triska, a 42-year-old power-plant technician for an Enron unit in Estaca=
da, Ore., says he warned many of his co-workers of the dangers of wagering a=
ll their retirement savings on Enron. "Even when Enron was going up," he say=
s, "I never put a cent into it -- it just doesn't make sense to load up on o=
ne stock." Nonetheless, even he has been unable to sell the stock that Enron=
 has contributed to his 401(k) as the share price has plummeted from $86 a l=
ittle more than a year ago to around $4 now. Under the company's 401(k) rule=
s, he can't sell until age 50.=20
For many rank-and-file workers, risk-averse or not, their 401(k)s are their =
largest assets, apart from their homes. So holding company stock they can't =
sell has become a source of resentment and frustration. Federal pension law =
leaves 401(k) plans largely outside the realm of regulation. But lately, som=
e employees have taken their frustration to the courts.=20
Just this month, in three separate lawsuits -- the latest filed yesterday --=
 participants in Enron's 401(k) plan allege that Enron misled them about the=
 risks of investing in the company's shares. The suits, all filed in Federal=
 District Court in Houston, note that the company "locked down" the retireme=
nt plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes. That prevent=
ed all employees, regardless of age, from selling any Enron shares in their =
401(k)s as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company a=
nd an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. Enron says it doesn't=
 comment on pending litigation.=20
Those lawsuits, along with a handful filed against other companies recently,=
 don't take on directly the practice of forcing employees to accept and hold=
 company stock in their 401(k)s. That's perfectly legal. So whatever the out=
come, a company would still be able to restrict employee sales of company-st=
ock contributions to 401(k) before the price declines. "Even when they've ha=
d gains, they can't really lock them in because they can't diversify," says =
Randall Shoker, an Oxford, Ohio, financial adviser.=20
Michael Green knows that. The 35-year-old investment specialist joined Dell =
Computer Corp. in 1995 as a product manager. He and his wife, Lisa, an assis=
tant controller at the company, were thrilled as the stock rose to about $51=
 a share in late 1999 from $1 in mid-1995, adjusted for splits.=20
But by the late '90s, the couple felt overexposed to Dell. In addition to th=
e Dell stock that the company had contributed to their 401(k) plans, they ha=
d received stock options as bonuses. And they had bought a home in Austin, T=
exas, where the real-estate market is tied in part to the fortunes of Dell, =
one of the area's biggest employers.=20
The Greens sold some of the stock they received as bonuses. But Dell wouldn'=
t let employees sell shares the company contributed to their retirement acco=
unts until they had been at the company for five years. "I tried so hard to =
sell," Mr. Green says. "We went around and around."=20
The company changed its policy last year to allow all Dell employees to sell=
 the shares in their 401(k) plan and shift the proceeds into alternatives av=
ailable through the plan. By then, though, Dell shares had plummeted, erasin=
g $200,000 from the Greens' 401(k) accounts. "That's as much as we paid for =
our house," Mr. Green says. Both left Dell earlier this year for other jobs.=
=20
SEC filings show that Dell executives, though subject to the same restrictio=
ns on their regular 401(k) accounts, can participate in a supplementary reti=
rement-savings plan that allows them immediately to reinvest the company's c=
ontribution in a variety of options. Executives have seized that opportunity=
: Just 9% of the supplementary retirement plan was invested in Dell stock at=
 the end of last year, according to the company's latest 11K filing, compare=
d with about 50% of Dell's 401(k) plan.=20
Dell spokesman T.R. Reid declines to comment on the Greens' circumstances. H=
e says that any employees who lose so much money on company contributions co=
uld do so only because they had made a bundle until that point. And providin=
g Dell shares to the employee retirement-savings plan, he says, "certainly p=
rovides incentive to not only think but act like a shareholder."=20
The company ended the five-year lock-down rule, Mr. Reid says, because it wa=
s no longer necessary to keep employees focused on improving Dell's sharehol=
der value. And he says Dell executives don't have to hold company stock in t=
heir supplementary plan because they "receive a significant portion of their=
 compensation in Dell stock," and thus they already "have the broader intere=
sts of the company and shareholders squarely in their sights."=20
SEC filings show that Dell executives nonetheless have means to protect them=
selves from exposure to the company's stock. Michael Dell, chairman and chie=
f executive of the computer company he founded, transferred a total of 4.1 m=
illion shares, worth $190.7 million, into so-called exchange funds in severa=
l transactions between September 1999 and May 2000. (The shares accounted fo=
r about 1.3% of Mr. Dell's total company holdings at the time).=20
Offered by financial firms to the wealthy, exchange funds are, in essence, m=
utual funds that allow holders of large chunks of a single stock to pool the=
ir assets, giving them a stake in a diversified, less-risky basket of securi=
ties and, in some cases, postponing tax liabilities. Altogether, the value o=
f Mr. Dell's hedged shares would have fallen in market value by 38%, or $73 =
million, by earlier this month had he taken no precautions. (The return on t=
he diversified exchange fund isn't disclosed).=20
Until the five-year rule was lifted, employees like Mr. Green could get out =
of their Dell 401(k) holdings only by withdrawing money from their accounts,=
 paying income tax and a 10% penalty on the withdrawal, and then reinvesting=
 the difference.=20
Or, says Dell spokesman Mike Maher, they could have elected "to take their c=
ompensation and not put it in their 401(k), and invest it in some other stoc=
k." By doing so, however, they would have forgone the company's matching con=
tribution altogether. Mr. Maher declines to comment on Mr. Dell's transactio=
ns. He notes that like executives, regular employees who receive options are=
 free to sell their shares. "We're all playing by the same rules," he says.=20
The hedging maneuvers executives can employ to protect their company holding=
s fall largely off the radar screens of regulators and shareholders. While t=
he SEC generally requires that key executives report these transactions, exp=
erts say the rules are largely ignored. "We really are only able to uncover =
several a month at most, which leads me to believe that the insiders are not=
 filing these as often as they should," says Lon Gerber, director of researc=
h at Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, which combs SEC filings to track in=
sider trading trends.=20
Mr. Dweck, head of the Goldman Sachs division that manages single-stock inve=
stments for wealthy investors, says his group's clients disclose their trans=
actions when required. And Qwest Chairman Philip Anschutz recently disclosed=
 that last May, he entered into a "forward-sale agreement" with a brokerage =
firm, locking in as many as 10 million Qwest shares at close to their then-c=
urrent price. Qwest's share price has since fallen 68%; the value of Mr. Ans=
chutz's shares covered in the agreement would have plunged to $127 million f=
rom $394 million. (Those shares amounted to about 3.3% of Mr. Anschutz's tot=
al holding of 300 million shares, or 18% of Qwest's shares outstanding, both=
 directly and through a company he controls.)=20
A forward-sale agreement wasn't available to Joseph Daugherty. He has been s=
tringing and repairing telephone cable for 23 years, first for Bell South Co=
rp. and then in the Salt Lake City area for U S West, which was acquired by =
Qwest last year.=20
A few months ago, he was looking forward to early retirement next summer. Bu=
t now, he says, he'll have to keep working. The $200,000 in assets he had in=
 his 401(k) in early May has shrunk to roughly $50,000. Part of that loss is=
 attributable to the retirement plan's rules, which don't allow most workers=
 to shift out of company-contributed Qwest shares until age 55. Mr. Daughert=
y, who concedes he's a risk-taker, blames himself for the rest: He voluntari=
ly sank the remainder of his 401(k) savings into Qwest stock.=20
Qwest won't comment on the finances of either Mr. Daugherty or Mr. Anschutz.=
 But Steve Hammack, a Qwest spokesman, says U S West established the policy =
of contributing company stock. He notes that starting Jan. 1, 2001, the comp=
any began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they re=
ceive this year into other investments available through the plan. The restr=
ictions on union members, he says, are covered by the company's collective b=
argaining agreement.=20
"The fact is," Mr. Hammack responds in an email, "the majority of companies =
in the U.S. that match employee contributions do so in their own company sto=
ck. A good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the compa=
ny match."=20
Erisa, the federal law governing pension plans, provides employees with litt=
le legal traction to complain about their forced 401(k) holdings. Employer c=
ontributions to retirement-savings plans aren't generally subject to fiducia=
ry rules. (As for employee contributions, employers are supposed to choose "=
prudent" investment options.)=20
Retirement-savings plans are exempt from Erisa diversification rules, too. T=
hese rules make it illegal for a company's pension plan to invest more than =
10% of its assets in the company's own securities. But savings plans such as=
 401(k)s can generally invest as much as 100% of the assets in company stock=
 with impunity. Currently, roughly one-third to one-half of retirement-plan =
assets at large companies are invested in company stock. That suits employer=
s, which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash, and=
 in the past, they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose div=
ersification rules on 401(k)s.=20
That confounds people such as Mr. Triska, the technician at Enron's Portland=
 General Electric unit. "Anyone will tell you that you need to diversify to =
reduce risk," he says.=20
Diversification has spared Mr. Triska some of the pain experienced by co-wor=
kers who bet big on Enron in their retirement savings. Since Sept. 10, while=
 the Enron shares in his 401(k) have plunged 86%, his shares in Weitz Partne=
rs Value Fund have declined only 4.52%, and his shares in Fidelity Growth Co=
mpany and Janus Global Life Sciences funds have risen 7.3% and 2.2%, respect=
ively.=20
Enron executives are subject to the same restrictions on Enron's stock contr=
ibutions to their 401(k)s as other employees: no sales of company-contribute=
d stock until age 50. But company filings with the SEC show that "key manage=
ment and highly compensated employees" also participate in separate retireme=
nt-savings plans that don't require them to hold Enron stock at all. Executi=
ves can pile as much as 35% of their salaries and 100% of their bonuses annu=
ally into these accounts, allocating the money among a variety of investment=
s.=20
Further, SEC filings show that so far this year, many Enron executives were =
steady sellers of company stock they had accumulated beyond the ambit of the=
ir 401(k)s. Former Enron Broadband Services Chief Executive Kenneth Rice, fo=
r example, sold Enron shares valued at $23.7 million during the period, and =
former CEO Jeffrey Skilling sold $27.5 million of Enron stock.=20
"We believe it's important for employees to have a stake in the company," sa=
ys Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's also important that we align =
employee and company performance."=20

Enron Talking With Dynegy As They Work To Rescue Deal
By By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

11/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation and its would-be rescuer, Dynegy Inc., are renegotiati=
ng the terms of their deal, originally valued at $9 billion, executives clos=
e to the discussions said yesterday.=20
There were several issues still on the table last night, and the situation w=
as very fluid, the executives said. But they said that the companies hoped t=
o announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price fo=
r the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; an agreement by some banks =
to extend the repayment dates of Enron debt until after the deal closes; and=
 possibly an agreement making clear that the merger would not be derailed by=
 litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan.
The sides were also negotiating ways to tighten clauses in the merger agreem=
ent so that Dynegy would not be able to use information from Enron's recent =
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a reason for backing o=
ut of the deal.=20
Both companies declined to comment on whether renegotiations were taking pla=
ce.=20
But according to executives close to the talks, the new terms would lower th=
e ratio of Dynegy stock to be exchanged to roughly 0.15 share for each share=
 of Enron. The original deal, announced Nov. 9, called for each Enron share =
to be exchanged for 0.2685 share of Dynegy. But Enron's shares have been plu=
nging steadily, and yesterday the current offer was valued at 163 percent ov=
er Enron's closing price.=20
The companies hope that by releasing some good news, they can stem the slide=
 in the price of Enron's stock and traded debt. Enron shares, which have bee=
n plunging since mid-October when the company began to disclose a series of =
losses and accounting errors, closed yesterday at $4.01, down 14.9 percent, =
or 70 cents. Shares of Dynegy closed at $39.25 yesterday, down 2.9 percent, =
or $1.15.=20
More important, the executives close to the talks said, the companies hope t=
o restore confidence in Enron's energy-trading operation, which showed signs=
 of deterioration yesterday. In recent years, Enron has traded more natural =
gas and electricity than its two biggest competitors combined, and its tradi=
ng floor is viewed as its most valuable franchise, accounting for most of th=
e company's profit.=20
Dynegy's biggest worry, according to the executives, is that this core busin=
ess is deteriorating. The company fears that if other energy traders further=
 curtail their business with Enron -- either on their own or in response to =
another cut in Enron's credit rating -- then much of the value of the compan=
y could be wiped out, they said.=20
The urgency of the situation has been made clear by the way in which Enron i=
s being treated in the energy-trading markets, some analysts and executives =
at rival energy companies say. Though some large traders are still doing bus=
iness with Enron, many other traders have curtailed their dealings with the =
company for fear they may not get paid if Enron collapses and files for bank=
ruptcy protection.=20
In addition, some of the energy trading Enron is doing is costing it more mo=
ney because of credit concerns. For example, analysts and energy executives =
say, Enron is in some cases being forced to pay 3 cents to 6 cents more per =
million British thermal units of natural gas. That means instead of paying p=
erhaps $1.80 per million B.T.U.'s in some trades, it may be paying $1.84.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company in Houston, said the price d=
iscrepancies on some trades were also showing up on EnronOnline, the Interne=
t platform that accounts for much of the company's trading with other partie=
s.=20
''We're seeing Enron's prices,'' Mr. Dietert said, ''be about a nickel highe=
r on EnronOnline versus some of the competing Internet-based exchanges.'' If=
 these credit premiums should continue, it could erode Enron's trading profi=
ts and worsen its already tenuous liquidity situation.=20
An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said trading volumes were ''below average=
,'' yesterday, but she declined to be more specific. She did say the company=
 was in discussions about a new equity infusion of $500 million to $1 billio=
n.=20
According to executives close to the talks, details were still being worked =
out on the cash infusion, which would come from Citigroup and J. P. Morgan C=
hase. Dynegy may also add cash to the deal while reaffirming the company's c=
ommitment to the merger.=20
Executives at rival trading companies said Dynegy needed to do something to =
bolster confidence in Enron's trading operations.=20
''In places, Enron is paying up to 4 or 5 or 6 cents more for next-day gas,'=
' said an executive at one large energy trader. ''Some producers out there d=
on't want to sell additional discretionary gas to Enron, so they're having t=
o pay up.''=20
The executive also said most energy traders expected that Dynegy would obtai=
n a much lower merger price because Enron had little or no room to fight a r=
enegotiation.=20
''If Enron hasn't lined something else up, their other choice is bankruptcy,=
'' he said. ''You can guess what shareholder value is going to look like if =
that's the case.''

Top Companies Issuing Debt At a Fast Pace
By STEPHANIE STROM

11/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

In the weeks since the attack on the World Trade Center, blue-chip corporati=
ons have issued a torrent of debt.=20
Ford, General Electric, I.B.M., Kraft, AT&T, General Motors and other compan=
ies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as =
investors, disenchanted with the stock market, have all but begged to buy th=
eir debt. In all, companies have issued 31.5 percent more debt in the last 1=
1 weeks than they did in the period a year earlier.
The companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain ba=
sement prices, thanks to low interest rates, and to retire more expensive de=
bt.=20
But they may also have little-discussed concerns that money will be scarce i=
n the future, particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recover=
y is less vigorous than economists now hope. Bank lending is at a 30-year lo=
w, according to the Conference Board, and buyers are hard to find for commer=
cial paper, the short-term, cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on. Sta=
ndard & Poor's says the amount of commercial paper issued by nonfinancial co=
mpanies has shrunk roughly 30 percent this year.=20
''Companies now can lock in substantially lower overall borrowing costs,'' s=
aid William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan. ''They =
have an opportunity to build a war chest to help them get through the hard t=
imes, and they're taking advantage of it.''=20
Before the terrorist attacks, analysts were expecting the issuing of debt to=
 slow late this year after a tremendous first half.=20
So much for expectations. Ford originally planned to raise $3 billion; it wa=
s able to raise $9.4 billion and is said to be thinking about trying to rais=
e $7 billion more.=20
Kraft Foods, part of the Philip Morris Companies, had planned to issue $2 bi=
llion worth of bonds. Instead, it offered $4 billion.=20
AT&T raised $10.1 billion, twice as much as it originally planned. AT&T's an=
d Ford's issues rank as the second- and third-largest ever.=20
All told, 573 corporations have issued $181 billion of debt since Sept. 11, =
compared with 692 companies that raised $138 billion in the period last year=
, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
''When you look at other asset classes, the corporate bond market offers som=
e of the better values,'' said Bob LoBue, head of the investment-grade fixed=
-income syndicate at J. P. Morgan, which has underwritten roughly half the i=
ssues that have come to market since Sept. 11. ''There's still a lack of con=
fidence in stock valuations based on the weakness we're seeing in earnings.'=
'=20
Issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on Tre=
asury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt. Corporate bonds a=
re often priced in relation to United States government debt, and thanks to =
a cascade of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, well-heele=
d companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates.=20
International Business Machines, for instance, recently sold $1.5 billion wo=
rth of five-year notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued, 4.875 perc=
ent.=20
Others, though, read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a si=
gn that credit is getting tight. Investment-grade companies typically juggle=
 a smorgasbord of debt -- short, intermediate and long term -- but they are =
definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days. No doubt, tha=
t is because debt is cheap -- but it also suggests that they may foresee a t=
ime when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests Mr. C=
unningham referred to.=20
It was not so long ago, after all, that companies experienced a credit short=
age. ''A credit crunch was brewing last year,'' Mr. Cunningham said, ''until=
 the Fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates, which =
averted it.''=20
But a cash problem persists in some ways despite the Federal Reserve's serie=
s of interest rate cuts. ''We are in a cash crisis like none we have experie=
nced in recent memory,'' said James Padilla, a Ford executive, in a recent m=
emorandum to his staff.=20
Many companies with less-than-pristine credit ratings have trouble raising m=
oney and may be having more because of the stampede by blue-chip companies.=20
''When companies like Ford or General Electric come into the market, they sq=
ueeze a lot of other, somewhat riskier credits out,'' said Gail D. Fosler, t=
he chief economist at the Conference Board.=20
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, s=
aid that the economic recovery depended on companies' being able to get cred=
it.=20
''My primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum,'' =
he said. ''We are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next yea=
r, but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availa=
bility of credit stays where it is or gets worse.''=20
Another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences. ''The =
Fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of c=
redit exuberance alive,'' Barton M. Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan=
 Stanley, wrote to investors earlier this month. ''The trouble is, although =
it may work in the short run, in the long run the debt burden will be bigger=
 and the adjustment process more painful.''=20
The automakers, for example, are using the money they have raised in part to=
 support the customer incentive programs that offer zero-interest financing.=
 They are paying as much as 7.25 percent, in other words, to lend money to c=
ar buyers for nothing.=20
Some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper. But companies=
 are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal.=20
The longer-term money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commerci=
al paper, even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time. The spread =
-- the difference in interest rates between Treasuries and corporate bonds -=
- has generally widened since Sept. 11, although not across the board.=20
''There is a cost factor involved, but we try to minimize that,'' said David=
 Moore, manager of fixed-income investor relations at Ford Credit, which acc=
ounted for the bulk of the $9.4 billion that Ford borrowed last month. ''We'=
re mindful of our liquidity, and want to make sure we ensure it.''=20
Like many of the companies issuing debt, Ford is curbing its dependence on t=
he commercial paper market. For the year through Oct. 16, Ford had cut the a=
mount of paper it had outstanding by almost 60 percent, to $17 billion. ''Th=
at puts us in a very good position, given our rating,'' said Mr. Moore, who =
was one of the few executives willing to discuss his company's strategy.=20
Ford, like a host of other companies, has had its credit ratings cut. Many b=
uyers of commercial paper, like money market funds, lend to only the highest=
-rated companies. So far this year, Standard & Poor's has knocked 57 compani=
es out of the top ratings for commercial paper, compared with 49 last year.=20
The total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen 30 percent this =
year, according to Diane Vazza, head of global financial investment research=
 at Standard & Poor's, thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among=
 investors. ''We've seen some issuers driven out of the market,'' Ms. Vazza =
said.=20
According to several credit analysts, DaimlerChrysler was scheduled to roll =
over $7 billion of commercial paper in June but decided to take the offering=
 to Europe, where investors are less particular about ratings quality.=20
Similarly, Enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem comme=
rcial paper as its credit ratings fell.=20
The decline in AT&T's commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big is=
sue last week.=20
But underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial=
 paper market has more to do with companies' ability to borrow for the long =
term cheaply than with their inability to issue short-term debt. ''Short-ter=
m financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to ro=
ll it over in order to maintain liquidity,'' said Mr. LoBue of J. P. Morgan.=
=20
The underwriters concede, however, that lending by banks has all but dried u=
p, falling to its lowest level in three decades. Bank lending has been curta=
iled at the behest of Federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance =
Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasur=
y Department, putting them seemingly at cross-purposes with the Fed.=20
The chief executive of EchoStar, Charles W. Ergen, had to put up $2.75 billi=
on of his own money to complete the purchase of the Hughes Electronic Corpor=
ation. The bankers at UBS Warburg, EchoStar's adviser on the deal, had offer=
ed to provide the financing, but only with a proviso that would have let the=
 bank back out of the deal under certain conditions.=20
Although the company later got financing from Credit Suisse First Boston and=
 Deutsche Bank, many other bankers have privately applauded UBS Warburg's ca=
ution.

Battered Enron in Search of $1 Billion; Stock's Decline Raises Doubts About =
Buyout

Shunned by investors and deserted by many former customers, Enron Corp. is s=
earching this week for up to $1 billion in cash from lenders to sustain its =
once dominant energy-trading business.=20
Enron stock fell yesterday to new low of $4.01 a share, down 70 cents, conti=
nuing the latest plunge that began last week when the Houston company disclo=
sed still more damaging detail about its financial condition.
A year ago, Enron stock traded for more than $78 a share, based on its leadi=
ng position then as a trader of power, natural gas, various industrial and t=
elecommunications products and financial contracts linked to these commoditi=
es.=20
Dynegy Inc., Enron's Houston rival, said yesterday it was not moving away fr=
om its $23 billion cash and debt offer to buy Enron. Enron declined to comme=
nt on its financial problems.=20
But Enron's stock has dropped more than 50 percent since the Dynegy deal was=
 announced Nov. 9. Investors believe that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal a=
t a cheaper price or even try to abandon it, said Brian Youngberg, a financi=
al analyst with Edward D. Jones & Co. in St. Louis.=20
"The [Dynegy] deal values Enron at more than $10 a share. For a company that=
's trading at $4, that doesn't make much sense," said Youngberg, who last we=
ek recommended that customers sell Enron shares.=20
As part of the Dynegy deal, Enron received $1.5 billion in cash, secured by =
stock in one of its pipelines. But without another large infusion of cash, t=
he company faces what Youngberg called a "death spiral."=20
Along with investors, many energy buyers and traders have lost confidence in=
 Enron's ability to make good on the long-term energy contracts it specializ=
es in, Youngberg said. Enron's most important operations involve contracts t=
o deliver natural gas, electric power and other energy products to industrie=
s and utilities in the future. It also sells financial instruments designed =
to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices.=20
These deals are the one part of Enron that Dynegy wants.=20
"Their core business has dropped off sharply," said Andrew Meade, an analyst=
 with Commerzbank Securities in New York. Enron remains a sizable player in =
the huge daily trading of energy products, but is being frozen out of long-t=
erm markets and relegated to less profitable short-term trades, said Meade.=20
The lengthy span of Enron's crisis, which began a month ago when it reported=
 a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, has given companies time to=
 close out contracts with Enron or limit their potential losses if Enron wer=
e to fail, said Louis B. Gagliardi, an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. in C=
onnecticut.=20
"If Enron went to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or failed, it would unsettle the =
market slightly. But it wouldn't catch people by surprise. So there's not mu=
ch danger of a crisis on the natural gas or power side" of energy trading, G=
agliardi said. Other market participants cautioned that the extent of Enron'=
s obligations to trading partners is not known to outsiders, making the impa=
ct of an Enron failure hard to assess.=20
Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco Corp., could pump billions of dollars =
into Enron's operations if the purchase went through, but under the best of =
circumstances, regulatory review of the deal will drag on for another six mo=
nths. Investors and traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang ar=
ound that long by itself, "That just adds to the uncertainty about the stock=
," Gagliardi said.=20
Dynegy's offer for Enron caused a brief rally in Enron's stock price and out=
look.=20
But that flurry of optimism was halted by a new financial report last week t=
o the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing even more serious debt ob=
ligations than the company had previously acknowledged.=20
Enron was able to negotiate a three-week extension on a $690 million note th=
at was coming due this week and finished arrangements on a $450 million line=
 of credit, part of a $1 billion infusion it had previously announced.=20
However, the $690 million obligation, disclosed in the SEC filing, was a ver=
y pointed alert to investors about Enron's growing cash needs, Meade said.=20
And the new details of Enron's plight in last week's filing further damaged =
the credibility of the company's financial reporting, Meade said.=20
"I don't think they have fully restated their earnings. There is probably mo=
re to come, Meade said."=20
Enron's board has turned to an outside committee to assess the company's fin=
ancial condition, after acknowledging last month that Enron had overstated e=
arnings by $586 million over the past four years.=20
The restatement was caused primarily by accounting decisions that concealed =
losses in a series of limited partnerships that Enron had helped create to b=
uy various energy, water supply and Internet network properties it wanted to=
 dispose of, the company said.=20
On Nov. 14, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, briefed analy=
sts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash, including the=
 current quest for $500 million to $1 billion in loans. Enron, its executive=
s said, will reorganize the company around its business that generated the s=
trongest cash flow -- energy trades, gas pipeline and coal operations. Other=
 assets, worth $8 billion in book value, would be put up for sale "in an ord=
erly fashion."=20
Then came the new disclosures last week, reinforcing analysts' concerns that=
 the depths of Enron's liabilities have not yet been plumbed.=20
"The issues that brought Enron to this point are unresolved. It's a balance =
sheet that doesn't stand still and continues to deteriorate," Gagliardi said=
=2E

Enron, Dynegy deal back on table=20
Energy traders said to be renegotiating premium for shares=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Dynegy and Enron Corp. could announce new terms for Dynegy's deal to buy Enr=
on as soon as today, according to sources familiar with talks between the tw=
o companies.=20
The two Houston-based energy traders, the sources said, spent the weekend an=
d Monday discussing, among other issues, a lower exchange rate for Dynegy's =
stock deal to buy Enron.=20
As of Monday evening, no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions we=
re continuing, the sources said, cautioning that the situation was fluid.=20
Also Monday:=20
=B7 Enron and Dynegy, the sources said, were working to finalize terms for a=
n equity infusion into Enron of around $500 million that's expected to come =
from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. Another equity infusion from oth=
er parties could come later, the sources said.=20
=B7 Enron, Dynegy and a group of banks were negotiating terms for a so-calle=
d "override" agreement that would extend, until after the merger closed, mat=
urity dates for certain debt Enron is due to repay or that could come due be=
fore, the sources said. It was unclear how much of approximately the $9 bill=
ion in obligations Enron could have coming due in the next 12 months that wo=
uld be covered by that restructuring.=20
=B7 It was expected that Enron would start layoffs sometime this week.=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said her only comment was that any action=
 the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to e=
mployees.=20
=B7 California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, not known for harboring a favo=
rable attitude toward Enron or other Texas energy companies, has started rev=
iewing the planned merger, looking for potential antitrust problems, his off=
ice said. Dynegy has power plants there, while Enron sells power and natural=
 gas into the state.=20
=B7 Shares in both companies fell, with Enron closing down 70 cents at $4.01=
, while shares in Dynegy ended the day down $1.15 at $39.25.=20
The talks between Enron and Dynegy come amid Wall Street expectations that D=
ynegy will renegotiate the merger terms or back out of the deal completely. =
The sources said that at the moment, the companies aren't discussing canceli=
ng the deal.=20
On Nov. 9, the day Dynegy announced it would acquire its troubled rival, sha=
res in Enron closed at $8.63, while shares in Dynegy closed at $38.76.=20
The merger agreement calls for Enron shareholders to get 0.2685 share of Dyn=
egy per Enron share. Based on the Nov. 9 closing prices, Dynegy would be pay=
ing $10.41 a share for Enron.=20
But since, Enron's share prices have dropped significantly amid increasing c=
oncerns about its ability to maintain its core trading business and troublin=
g new disclosures about its financial shape.=20
Based on Monday's closing prices, Dynegy would be paying more -- $10.54 a sh=
are -- for Enron, which is worth considerably less based on market capitaliz=
ation than when the deal was announced.=20
Last week, one stock analyst said he thought a ratio of no more than 0.15 sh=
are of Dynegy per Enron share might be more realistic.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Monday that Dynegy was continuing its "due =
diligence" review of Enron's books and "looking at everything very closely."=
=20
Unless the merger with Dynegy goes through, Enron could be forced into bankr=
uptcy protection.=20
Enron's core trading business has eroded, the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion is investigating its finances and it faces a pile of debt as well as an=
 increasing number of shareholder and employee lawsuits.=20
Enron and Dynegy hoped the merger deal, which included an immediate infusion=
 of $1.5 billion of equity into Enron, would stabilize Enron.=20
But new financial disclosures have had the opposite effect.=20
For example, on Nov. 19, Enron revealed $690 million in debt would come due =
sooner than expected because of a credit-rating downgrade.=20
The news came as a surprise even to Dynegy.=20
Dynegy has escape hatches in its merger agreement, including a "material adv=
erse change" clause that applies generally to Enron's financial state.=20
Also, if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is gr=
eater than $3.5 billion, the deal can be called off.=20
Sousa described the escape clauses as "broad provisions" to ensure Dynegy is=
 adequately protected.=20

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo=20
By MARY FLOOD=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Whether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likely=
 to deeply affect one of Houston's largest law offices: the one within the e=
mbattled company.=20
"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston," said Ho=
ward Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest f=
irms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone.=20
Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. T=
hat's a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000 employee=
s. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would hav=
e been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100 survey relea=
sed in May.=20
Energy trader Enron's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge =
trading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor,=
 Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors =
it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy.=20
Whatever the company's fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers.=
=20
Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed =
and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron's legal staff, specula=
tion in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyer=
s could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold o=
n tightly to its talent.=20
"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more stea=
dy state. There's a lot of legal work to go through," said Joel Swanson, a s=
enior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyers he=
re.=20
Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but it=
 also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few yea=
rs. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for eithe=
r Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outside firms =
will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created.=20
Enron's legal department has siphoned talent from Houston's top law firms ov=
er the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising law=
yers lured away by Enron's competitive pay combined with stock options, whic=
h were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percent of th=
eir value.=20
"Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country," said Jeff L=
ove, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm with abo=
ut 175 of its lawyers here.=20
Enron has hired a lot of what are called "laterals," or lawyers who have had=
 a couple years training, often at a big firm.=20
Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier t=
han big-firm life, that's not the reputation of Enron's legal eagles.=20
As with the company itself, the general counsel's office has been known as i=
nnovative and hard driving.=20
"I don't think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an ordin=
ary life," Ayers said.=20
In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around $11=
0,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron wer=
e the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company.=20
If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expect ca=
sualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad for jo=
b-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom in rough =
times.=20
Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger s=
tarting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don't expect to scale back t=
heir business in the immediate future.=20
Should the merger succeed, Enron's 245 lawyers will join Dynegy's 43.=20
"The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of things a=
ssociated with the merger, won't be worked out for some time," Dynegy spokes=
man Steve Stengel said.=20

Bin Laden threat against pipelines taken seriously=20
Ashcroft: Unconfirmed warning linked to leader's death, capture=20
By MICHAEL DAVIS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
The FBI confirmed Monday that it has warned the energy industry that Osama b=
in Laden may have ordered strikes against U.S. natural gas facilities if he =
is caught or killed.=20
The agency issued the warning last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft said=
 at a news conference Monday. It had uncorroborated information that bin Lad=
en may have approved plans for such attacks, Ashcroft added.=20
The FBI warning said "such an attack would allegedly take place in the event=
 that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or =
killed."=20
The warning hit home in Houston because while the warning did not single out=
 a target, it referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure, such as p=
ipelines. Houston is the hub of this industry and is at the center of a dens=
e web of gas pipelines.=20
The warning was considered similar to the one issued earlier about potential=
 attacks against West Coast bridges.=20
Ashcroft said the government is in regular communication with companies that=
 own the nation's energy infrastructure, such as refineries, natural gas pip=
elines and nuclear plants.=20
Federal law enforcement officials received the uncorroborated report of unde=
termined reliability about a potential attack against natural gas supplies a=
bout 10 days ago, Ashcroft said.=20
Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, all energy companies have establish=
ed more stringent security measures. Pipelines, however, are considered espe=
cially vulnerable since they are accessible above ground in remote areas wit=
h typically little more than a padlock and a metal fence to keep out someone=
 wanting to damage the line.=20
Reliant Energy Entex, the natural gas distribution company that serves the H=
ouston area, was notified about the warning but has not added any new securi=
ty measures as a result, company spokeswoman Alicia Dixon said.=20
"We've been on a heightened state of alert since Sept. 11 so nothing is diff=
erent today than it was yesterday," Dixon said. "We have very strong securit=
y in place already because of the nature of our business. We have to be prep=
ared to deal with a variety of emergencies."=20
Dixon said the company recieved word of the warning from the American Gas As=
sociation. The American Petroleum Institute also passed the warning on to en=
ergy companies, API spokesman Juan Palomo said.=20
Enron notified its employees of the warning and also has been on heightened =
state of alert since Sept. 11, company spokeswoman Gina Taylor said.=20
"We take all threats seriously," Taylor said.=20
Enron monitors its pipelines and related facilities such as compression stat=
ions using planes, cars and on foot, she said. The company has not added sta=
ff to beef up its security as a result of the warning, she said.=20
"We routinely patrol the right of way," she said.=20
There are thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines running throughout the=
 nation. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas=
 transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America=
=2E=20
Detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastru=
cture has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Acces=

Federal regulators have offered help to pay for the added protection by spee=

If a pipeline were attacked with an explosive, for example, the operator cou=

Current recession differs from others=20
By JIM BARLOW=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
So it's official. The United States is in a recession.=20
That was the word Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research. A re=
cession, by the by, comes about after six months of declining economic activ=
ity. In this case, the bureau said, the recession started last March, so we'=
re already through almost nine months of slowdown.=20
But there's something very different about this recession, different from al=
l the others we've experienced in the past four or five decades. We were not=
 led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse=
 in those prices.=20
The current recession was sparked by a high-tech collapse, led by a glut of =
technology products.=20
That doesn't mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession. Th=
ere are places that will be hurting. San Francisco comes to mind. It is a hi=
gh-tech center, and there was a lot of building to accommodate that industry=
=2E=20
There is also one real estate sector in trouble -- the hotel industry. It ha=
d already been hurt by a downturn in business travel. The Sept. 11 terrorist=
 attacks sent it, and air travel, reeling.=20
Recall see-through buildings?
But there's nothing like we saw back in the mid-1980s. Remember when Houston=
 enriched the nation's vocabulary by coming up with the term see-through bui=
ldings? Those were the many skyscrapers in Houston that had been built but n=
ever finished inside. So you could look right through them because there wer=
e no interior walls.=20
Indeed, if real estate is a bright spot in this recession, real estate in Ho=
uston is a great shining light.=20
Houston's office building market is tight. The downtown office market has an=
 8.9 percent vacancy rate, and prime Class A space prized by major corporati=
ons is effectively full. There should be some easing of that rate. Enron Cor=
p., with its well-publicized freefall, has almost completed a new headquarte=
rs. Even more space will be coming onto the market when the 32-story Calpine=
 Center office tower is completed at 717 Texas Ave. in 2003.=20
Century Development has announced it is working on a 40-story office tower d=
owntown. Crescent Real Estate Equities is building a tower on the other side=
 of Main Street. All this, plus cutbacks at Continental Airlines and the pen=
ding sale of Compaq Computer Corp. to Hewlett-Packard Co., will doubtless hu=
rt the office market. But no one is predicting disaster.=20
The Houston apartment market may be the nation's healthiest, with 93.5 perce=
nt of Houston's apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year. That =
figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before. Prices=
 for apartments are up, as are rents.=20
Sales of used homes in October were the highest ever, with the median price =
up 3.9 percent. New-home sales are setting records.=20
Developers are optimists
So how did we escape the usual? Credit lenders.=20
Real estate developing is full of optimists. Ask any developer -- even in th=
e midst of a bust -- and he'll tell you. It won't affect his building, which=
 somehow is nicer, sexier or even more depression-proof than the next guy's.=
 Give a developer money, and he will build.=20
Lenders have been as tight as the bark on trees. That has forced developers =
to pre-lease buildings and seek partners with equity -- primarily pension fu=
nds -- before the banks would loan them money for new projects.=20
Several things happen to the real estate business during a recession. Prices=
 fall or stabilize -- and in this particular recession the bet is probably o=
n stabilization. The banks and others that loan that money generally tighten=
 credit standards, cutting off weaker real estate players. And the Federal R=
eserve Board helps out the economy by lowering rates, which aids bargain hun=
ters with deep pockets.=20
In any recession, even one that is as benign to real estate as this one, som=
e properties won't survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sel=
l or file for bankruptcy.=20
With the current low interest rates, companies with good credit will move in=
 and buy those properties. Remember the so-called vulture funds of the 1980s=
?=20
How soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession. Be=
cause real estate is in good shape this time, the process is not as importan=
t as it was in the 1980s. Still, if investors promptly snap up distressed pr=
operties, that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short on=

Enron Gains on Optimism Dynegy Purchase to Proceed (Update1)
2001-11-27 07:59 (New York)

     (Updates to add Instinet trading, comment by Tice.)

     Houston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares rose as
much as 3.5 percent on Instinet amid optimism Dynegy Inc. will
proceed with its proposed acquisition of the rival U.S. energy
trader after renegotiating the terms of its offer.

     Shares of the energy trader plunged 55 percent last week on
concern the merger would unravel after Enron said it had more debt
and less cash than previously announced, threatening its ability
to operate until Dynegy completes the purchase.

     Executives of the two companies discussed possible changes in
the terms over the weekend, people familiar with the matter said
yesterday. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15
shares for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about
$5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people close to the discussions.

     ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file
for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris
Harris, a Houston-based financial services company.

     Enron shares rose as much as 14 cents to $4.15 on Instinet.
The original Dynegy bid valued Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy
stock. The discount reflects skepticism among investors the
acquisition will be completed under the original terms.

     Bond investors were less optimistic. The company's 6.4
percent bonds that mature in 2006 declined to 45 cents on the
dollar from 48 cents on the dollar yesterday, traders said. At
that price, the bonds yield 28.5 percent.

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank. Last week's Securities and
Exchange Commission filing ``had a lot of negative surprises.''

     Investors have become concerned because Enron hasn't been
able to complete a proposal to raise $2 billion through a private
equity sale and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to
downgrade the company's credit rating.

                           Extension?

     The companies may announce as early as today an extension by
some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500 million cash
infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and an
agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits
over Enron's employee-retirement plan, the New York Times said.

     Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman
John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

     ``If they can renegotiate the deal to half (the original
price), that's where you get really attractive earnings,'' said
Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a
``buy.''

                         Enron's Debt

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more, Howald said. Barone has reduced his
estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings from $1.65 a share to 75 cents.

     Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25
yesterday.

      New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the
additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors
said.

     ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that
kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses --
trading, pipelines and energy management -- are still sound,''
said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets
in the Strong Utilities Fund, 4.3 percent of which is Dynegy
stock.

    Enron has debt payments of more than $9 billion due before the
end of 2002, and has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines
left, the company said in a filing last week. If its cash reserves
run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment
grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two
affiliated partnerships.

                           Reprieve

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed a 10-Q quarterly report with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Nov. 9, it rated
Enron's debt one notch above junk. The rating company's analysts
didn't return calls seeking comment.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB,'' a level below investment grade.
     The Houston-based company also said in the filing that it had
a $690 million note due this week, and that it may have to reduce
fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million. The write-off would come
because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated
partnership, and the value of that stock has plunged.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line.
Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was
``encouraged'' by the developments.

     Enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt, Denne
said yesterday. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup executives met today to
line up investors willing to buy $2 billion in bonds convertible
into Enron stock.

                       Deteriorating Daily

     Many of Enron's trading partners are shunning the company,
and some analysts now say Enron's 2002 earnings may hurt, rather
than boost, Dynegy's earnings, as Watson has projected.

     ``The value of the assets Dynegy is trying to buy -- the
trading and marketing businesses -- are deteriorating on a daily
basis as more counterparties back off on trading and dealing with
Enron,'' said Mike Heim, a securities analyst at A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc.

     Watson said on Nov. 9 that the merger would increase Houston-
based Dynegy's 2002 earnings by 35 percent to $3.40 to $3.50 a
share.

     To realize those gains, Watson will have to help Enron stay
out of bankruptcy by helping it get financing, Vuchetich said.

    ``Dynegy needs to make sure there's no hint the trading
operation is worth less than they thought,'' Vuchetich said. ``It
has to be kept running to maintain its value.''

Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's Tice Comments on Enron Corp. Debt
2001-11-27 07:50 (New York)

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Paul Tice, co-head of U.S.
high-grade credit research and who covers the energy sector for
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc., a unit of Deutsche Bank AG,
comments on the fall in Enron Corp. bond prices.

     ``Whenever you have an information vacuum, bond prices tend
to trade down. The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down.
The last information investors got was the 10Q filing, which had a
lot of negative surprises.

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right now?
Or, as of the 16th, which was lower than most people were
expecting? Is the falloff in the cash position of the company
stabilizing or not?'

     ``We are still waiting for some follow-up from Enron
management. There is the concern that the deal with Dynegy is
breaking down, and the stock price isn't telling you otherwise.''
Investors are waiting for ``an announcement on the private equity
deal that Enron is looking to raise with its lead banks and for
more information regarding restructuring of its bank debt, which
alluded to in press release'' last week.

     ``Enron needs to push out the maturities on its unsecured
revolvers that it drew down. $2 billion of the $3 billion comes
due in April, that is the main piece of bank restructuring, aside
from the $690 million note'' that is payable.

As Dynegy Inc. continued to scrutinize merger partner Enron Corp.'s tangled =

"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going throug=

Under terms of the original agreement between the two Houston- based energy =

As investor doubts have grown, so has the gap between the buyout price and t=

 $4.01.=20
Enron's market capitalization--the value of the company's approximately 850 =

 Any of the parties "could send this company over the edge at any moment," s=

Enron's fall from grace has been astonishingly swift and painful for its sto=

With Monday's drop, Enron shares have tumbled 95 percent from the $82 they c=

Partnership woes=20
The strategy made Enron a stock market darling, but it also periodically str=

=20
While Enron's power trading group has experienced operating problems of late=
, it is the limited partnerships--some of which were managed by Enron offici=

In October, Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by $1.=
2 billion to buy back 55 million shares it had issued to the partnerships. T=
he charge associated with "unwinding" the web of partnerships stunned invest=

As further accounting difficulties surfaced, Enron's finances have turned in=

The pressure on Enron is mounting not just from Wall Street but from regulat=

GLOBAL INVESTING - A creative approach to property liabilities.
By ALISON BEARD.

GLOBAL INVESTING - A creative approach to property liabilities - Many big co=
mpanies use 'synthetic' leases to keep real estate costs off their balance s=
heets, reports Alison Beard.=20
Synthetic leases were among the many creative financing techniques used by E=
nron, the troubled energy trading company. But the structure, which allows c=
ompanies to keep real estate costs off their balance sheets while claiming t=
he tax benefits of ownership, is legal and used by dozens of companies from =
Toys R Us to Yahoo!.
"A synthetic lease is a debt alternative," said Michael Rotchford, senior ma=
naging director at Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services firm. "Almo=
st invariably for companies with good standing, (it) will provide them with =
much lower ongoing expenses than traditional leases."=20
But shareholders should be wary of companies that are simply disguising thei=
r property liabilities. "They've got long-term assets and they're financed t=
hem with short-term means," says Anne Coolidge, executive director at WP Car=
ey, the real estate banking firm that specialises in sale leasebacks, an alt=
ernative to synthetic leases. "Traditionally equity analysts haven't taken t=
hat into account, although debt analysts have. Everyone should know about th=
ese things."=20
Companies choose synthetic leases because traditional options - rental agree=
ments or outright ownership - are often unattractive. Ownership means tying =
up cash in non-core real estate assets, but renting is more expensive in the=
 long term.=20
Cisco Systems, the networking equipment company, estimated in the mid-1990s =
that leasing would cost it 5-6 per cent more a year than owning its properti=
es. At the same time, investors eager for double-digit profit growth were un=
likely to tolerate a slowly appreciating real estate asset on the company's =
balance sheet. So Cisco chose synthetic leases.=20
The deals works as follows. A lender agrees to pay for a new development or =
an addition to a property. The company's "rent" is the interest on that fina=
ncing, set at a rate reflecting its credit standing and priced as a spread o=
ver the London Interbank Office Rate. These payments are deducted from the c=
ompany's taxes.=20
Meanwhile, the company acts as owner and manager of the property, assuming a=
ll risk. It sets aside money to purchase the property at the end of the leas=
e, listing the earmarked funds as "restricted cash" or "long-term assets" on=
 its balance sheet. Sometimes the company can extend the lease at the end of=
 the term or sell the property, but that is at the lender's discretion.=20
Although depreciation of the property's value is not included on the company=
's balance sheet, it can be listed as a tax deduction. So far, the Financial=
 Accounting Standards Board has issued few guidelines on synthetic leases. B=
ut "it is a loophole (that allows) the ownership and the lease benefits to a=
ccrue to the same player," said Gary DeClark, managing director of Integra R=
ealty Resources, the property appraisal and consulting firm. "Sooner or late=
r, it will probably be closed up."=20

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Hobbled energy giant Enron Corp. , in an effort=
 to save its planned purchase by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. , may cut the pri=
ce of the all-stock transaction by more than 40 percent to about $5 billion,=
 the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.=20
Enron also was negotiating to extend the maturity dates of some of its borro=
wings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis according to people famili=
ar with the matter, the paper said.
The move to renegotiate the agreement, and particularly to cut the number of=
 Dynegy shares that Enron holders would receive, two weeks after the pact's =
signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions, the Wall Street J=
ournal said.=20
Escape clauses built into the deal give Dynegy the option to back out if the=
re is a serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets.=20
Enron has total debt of about $13 billion, according to the Wall Street Jour=
nal, adding that analysts are increasingly worried that the giant energy-tra=
ding concern's relatively few hard assets are so burdened by debt that they =
cannot be used to bolster further borrowing.=20
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco Corp. , is=
 to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dy=
negy closed at $29.25 on New York Stock Exchange trade.=20
Once high-flying Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by=
 a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-shee=
t dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cu=
ts to its credit ratings.=20
Enron subsequently restated its earnings some $600 million lower, and invest=
or unease exploded and sent its shares tumbling. Shares were above $90 in Au=
gust 2000.=20
Enron stock closed down 73 cents, or 15.4 percent, at $4.01 on the New York =
Stock Exchange on Monday. ((-New York Equities Desk (646) 223-6000)).

Enron, Dynegy Discuss Plan to Cut Price of Acquisition

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., struggling to save its two-week-old deal to be acquired by Dyne=
gy Inc., was in advanced discussions with Dynegy to cut the price of the all=
-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion, people familiar wit=
h the matter told The Wall Street Journal.=20
Beleaguered Enron (ENE) also was in continuing negotiations to extend the ma=
turity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity =
crisis, these people said. Enron has total debt of about $13 billion. Increa=
singly, analysts are worried that the giant energy-trading concern's relativ=
ely few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can't be used to sup=
port further borrowing.
Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. Monday on th=
e New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the past =
few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a proce=
ss that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a quart=
erly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, revelat=
ions that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets =
on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice restat=
ed earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy tradin=
g business is showing some signs of stress.=20
The move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement, and particularly to slash=
 the number of Dynegy (DYN) shares that Enron holders would receive, only tw=
o weeks after the pact's signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transa=
ctions. While terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments,=
 that typically doesn't happen until a transaction is nearly completed.=20
Enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement Monday tha=
t would calm its anxious investors, but the situation remained fluid through=
out the day. As of Monday evening, the revised deal still hadn't been formal=
ized.=20
The deal is critical for Enron. In recent weeks, credit-rating agencies have=
 indicated they will refrain from further cuts to Enron's credit rating so l=
ong as a Dynegy purchase appears probable. But if that deal collapses, downg=
rades could occur that would put Enron below investment grade and in violati=
on of credit agreements with counterparties. This in turn could deal a savag=
e blow to Enron's commodity-trading business that is its lifeblood.=20
Negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of Houston Mo=
nday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban New York=
 where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal, which was announce=
d Nov. 9. Both Dynegy and Enron declined to comment on the discussions.=20

Report: Enron, Dynegy deal back on table

HOUSTON (AP) - Executives of Dynegy Inc. plan to announce new terms for thei=
r $9 billion buyout offer for Enron Corp. as shares in Enron continue to fal=
l, according to the Houston Chronicle.=20
Sources familiar with talks between the two companies told the newspaper tha=
t the announcement could come as soon as Tuesday.
The sources said officials of the two Houston-based energy traders spent the=
 weekend and Monday discussing a lower exchange rate for rival Dynegy's stoc=
k deal to buy Enron, among other issues.=20
But as of Monday evening, no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussion=
s were continuing, the sources said, cautioning that the situation continued=
 to change.=20
The sources said Enron and Dynegy were working to finalize terms for an equi=
ty infusion into Enron of around $500 million that's expected to come from J=
=2EP. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. Another equity infusion from other p=
arties was also possible later, the sources said.=20
Layoffs by Enron were expected to begin sometime this week, according to the=
 report. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said any action the company would tak=
e concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees.=20
Enron shares fell another 15 percent Monday, and briefly traded below their =
all-time low, as investors continued to doubt that a $9 billion buyout offer=
 from Dynegy would be completed under the current terms.=20

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo=20
HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subj=
ect of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trade=
r.=20
The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms.=20
"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston," said Ho=
ward Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest w=
ith about 240 lawyers in Houston.=20
Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. W=
ith about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have be=
en the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle.=20
Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now =
set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted fu=
rther, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to f=
ace possible bankruptcy.=20
Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of=
 lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will=
 hold on tightly to its talent.=20
"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more stea=
dy state. There's a lot of legal work to go through," said Joel Swanson, a s=
enior partner at Baker & Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston=
=2E=20
In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just=
 about every large firm in Houston over the last few years.=20

MONEY MAKE-OVER Club Sticks Together Through Thick, Thin

SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

Like a lot of investors, the Women Taking Stock investment club got to the G=
reat Bull Market of the 1990s just as the party was coming to an end.=20
Dazzled by watching others reap double-digit returns in the stock market yea=
r after year, the group of Westside friends decided to form an investment cl=
ub and get in on the fun.
It hasn't exactly been a joy ride.=20
A victim of bad timing, the club made its first purchase in late 1998 and co=
ntinued building its portfolio over the next three years as the market peake=
d and then plunged--taking many of the club's holdings with it.=20
Five of the club's selections have lost more than half their purchase price,=
 and some of the worst performers have shed two-thirds of their value. With =
their portfolio awash in red ink, club members have been paralyzed into inac=
tion.=20
"We are not comfortable selling anything," said Gail Berlant, a founder of t=
he 15-member group. "And we are hesitant to buy, although we think it might =
be a good time."=20
What makes the downdraft more difficult to stomach is that the club thought =
it was employing a safe strategy. It chose mostly well-known companies it ex=
pected to be steady performers, avoiding riskier choices. And unlike many in=
vestment clubs, Women Taking Stock diversified its holdings and resisted the=
 temptation to buy Internet stocks, a once-hot sector that burned many inves=
tors when it crashed.=20
The group's portfolio includes several well-known names in pharmaceuticals, =
entertainment, energy and financial services. Although their few technology =
choices, including Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, have contributed to =
their fall, they've also lost big on non-tech stocks such as retailer Gap.=20
Despite the declines, the club members are determined not to give up. They i=
ntend to stick together--defying the trend among many investment clubs to di=
sband in the face of the grinding bear market. And although they are still s=
olidly on the losing side of the ledger, there are some factors that bode we=
ll for the group's future.=20
For one thing, the stakes are relatively modest: Members contribute $125 to =
join and chip in $50 a month. No one is counting on the club to pay for a ch=
ild's college costs or to fund a retirement. The club's entire portfolio is =
currently worth less than $25,000.=20
In addition, members see the group as a way to learn about investing, not as=
 a road to instant riches. "We look at this as a learning process," Berlant =
said.=20
Perhaps most important, club members learn from their mistakes. For instance=
, they realize that their stock selection has lacked focus, particularly in =
the early days.=20
"Each meeting, people would present stocks they had read about in newspapers=
 and in Better Investing," a publication of the National Assn. of Investors =
Corp., an umbrella group for clubs, said Sandy Roberts, the club's president=
=2E=20
Using that approach, many of the club's early investments were in companies =
that members were familiar with, high-profile names such as Disney, Coca-Col=
a and Gap. "We thought Gap's TV commercials were fantastic," member Susan Os=
ti said.=20
The results were disappointing, even given the stock market's overall declin=
e. Gap, for example, has lost 61% since the club bought it. The Standard & P=
oor's index of retail stocks is down about 3% during that same period.=20
After several of their other early choices tanked--the club's WorldCom share=
s, purchased in October 1999, are down 80%--the club members decided to adop=
t a more systematic approach to stock-picking.=20
"A year ago, a stock broker friend of ours told us that we should focus on c=
ertain industries and assign people to research stocks within those industri=
es," member Penny Berro said. "So we divided up some industries [among the m=
embers] and started by looking at pharmaceuticals and energy."=20
In the pharmaceutical field, the group settled on Pfizer, which has risen 15=
% since the club purchased it in March, and Johnson & Johnson, which also se=
lls consumer products and is up 32% since March.=20
In energy, the club narrowed its choice to Enron and Dynegy. At the time, En=
ron was getting bad publicity for its role in California's electricity woes,=
 leaving the women feeling uncomfortable with buying stock in the Houston-ba=
sed company.=20
"There were no red flags with Dynegy," Vicki Whitney said. "It was diversifi=
ed and seemed like it could withstand problems better than Enron."=20
The choice has proved to a wise one, relatively speaking. Enron, enmeshed in=
 an accounting scandal, is down 91% since July. Dynegy has been hurt by a sh=
arp downturn in energy stocks that accompanied the recent fall in oil prices=
, but is down a comparatively mild 19% since the club bought it. Ironically,=
 part of Dynegy's current slide is due to its proposed acquisition of Enron.=
=20
Club members asked Times Business editors to review their portfolio. In a re=
cent meeting with the group, Senior Markets Editor Tom Petruno encouraged cl=
ub members not to be too hard on themselves, noting that they avoided the mi=
stake made by many investment clubs: concentrating too much--or all--of thei=
r money in volatile tech stocks.=20
"You have some failures, but you've also done some things right," Petruno sa=
id. "You arrived late in the market, but you've got good asset allocation."=20
But he warned that selecting stocks such as Gap and Disney merely because th=
ey are large or well-known is not necessarily a sound strategy. "It used to =
be that you couldn't go wrong with Gap," Petruno said. "Now you can go very =
wrong. Just because a company is big and has a huge brand name doesn't guara=
ntee anything."=20
He suggested that the members stick to their commitment to dig into a compan=
y's financial condition and competitive position before investing.=20
"Read annual reports and quarterly reports and really look at a company's fu=
ndamentals," Petruno said. "Ask yourself what's going on with the company. A=
re you comfortable with management? What's the company's focus? If it's havi=
ng problems, how does it plan to get back on track?"=20
Club members should be wary of companies with a lot of debt on their books, =
he said, particularly if club members expect the current economic downturn t=
o be prolonged. "What's reasonable debt in a good economy may not be reasona=
ble in a bad economy," he said. "Creditors tend to get nervous in a bad econ=
omy. Debt can sink a company."=20
The club should compare debt-to-equity ratios for companies in the same indu=
stry to determine if a company's debt load is unusually heavy, Petruno said.=
=20
Martin Zimmerman, Times assistant business editor for markets, also warned t=
he club to resist buying stocks that appear to be cheap just because they've=
 fallen a long way from their highs. "Even if you find a viable company that=
 may be priced at $20 [a share] after once being priced at $150, that doesn'=
t make it a bargain," he said. "It may only ever be worth $25, or worse, it =
may only be worth $10."=20
The club deserves credit for going against conventional wisdom by buying sto=
cks in industries that may be momentarily out of favor, Petruno said.=20
Referring to the club's decision in August to buy more shares of Cisco Syste=
ms, Petruno said: "I'm glad you're not succumbing to the temptation not to l=
ook at anything in tech. A lot of people who lost money in that area won't g=
o near it. But there will be survivors. And fortunes can be made by picking =
stocks when no one else likes them."=20
Refining its buying discipline is only one of the club's challenges. Investo=
rs also need to know when to sell. Women Taking Stock has sold only one stoc=
k in its history, and it sold that one, Compaq Computer, only after the comp=
any's shares lost a third of their value and a friend in the securities indu=
stry urged them to unload the stock.=20
Meanwhile, stocks that have shed more than half their value, such as Gap, Wo=
rldCom and Applied Materials, remain in their portfolio.=20
"Our goal was to buy stocks that would double in five years," Berlant said. =
"That's why we haven't sold anything."=20
One way to take make the decision easier is for club members to set a limit =
on how much they're willing to lose on a stock, Petruno suggested. If a stoc=
k drops 25%, for example, the club could unload it or at least agree to take=
 a critical look to determine whether it's worth sticking with.=20
"It's easy to say that a stock is going to come back, but they don't always =
come back," he said. "Many times, a 25% loss can turn into a 40% or 50% loss=
=2E You need a point where you will take a hard look and decide whether you =
need to cut your losses."=20
One thing club members agree on: Although their initiation into investing ha=
s come during the worst bear market in three decades, they're determined to =
stay the course.=20
"We realize that we got into the market late," Roberts said. "But we've lear=
ned a lot and we're not discouraged. We're definitely going to hang in there=

Enron, Dynegy to rework $24B deal
by Claire Poole in Houston

11/27/2001
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

Houston energy company Dynegy has reportedly reopened talks with its ailing =
crosstown rival since the collapse of Enron's stock price, which has been sl=
iced in half since the acquisition was announced.=20
Houston energy company Dynegy Inc. has returned to the bargaining table and =
is talking with ailing crosstown rival Enron Corp. and related parties about=
 modifying their $24 billion merger agreement, according to sources close to=
 the deal.
The two power traders are in a "friendly renegotiation," sources say. "All t=
he parties are talking as it relates to terms and conditions," one person sa=
id.=20
The main reason for rekindling the talks is the collapse of Enron's stock pr=
ice, which has been sliced in half since the acquisition was announced Nov. =
9 for $24 billion in cash, stock and debt assumption.=20
The deal valued Enron's shares at $10.41, a 20% premium over its $8.63 close=
 before the announcement. But Enron's shares have fallen steadily since, clo=
sing Monday at $4.01, down nearly 15% on the day.=20
Dynegy's stock has also lost about 11% of its value since the deal was annou=
nced, closing down 2.85% Nov. 26 to $39.25.=20
John Olson, a longtime Enron follower at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, t=
hinks Dynegy might be pushing for $5.25 per share. "That's closer to the rea=
lity of the current market," he said.=20
If Dynegy can't work out a better deal, another course might be to allow Enr=
on to slip into bankruptcy, according to sources.=20
With Enron's stock price slipping and only $1 billion in cash remaining, Ols=
on thinks it's the wiser of the two options. "Would Enron be better off to g=
o bankrupt or get nickeled and dimed to death by Wall Street that is not in =
love with this deal?" he asks. "Chapter 11 looks more sensible to me."=20
Olson said if Enron can get $3 billion in debtor financing, bankruptcy would=
 be preferable to anything else. "The lower stock price, the higher probabil=
ity [of Chapter 11]," he said. "Investors, creditors and bankers all want so=
me closure on this."=20
Olson speculates that only the sick part of Enron -- the parent and the trad=
ing operations, which are worth about $12.5 billion -- would file for bankru=
ptcy, while the healthy part -- the pipeline and energy outsourcing assets, =
which are worth around $5 billion -- would be left out.=20
"You'd end up with a 'good bank, bad bank' profile," he said, referring to t=
he strategy many financial firms followed when they went bust in the 1980s.=20
Dynegy would be an obvious buyer of the pipeline and energy outsourcing asse=
ts. It already has an option to buy Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co. pipelin=
e system if the deal doesn't go through, in exchange for its $1.5 billion in=
vestment in Enron at the deal's signing, provided by investor ChevronTexaco =
Corp., of San Francisco.=20
If Dynegy walks away from the deal, it would have to pay a $350 million brea=
kup fee plus $10 million in expenses.=20
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer wouldn't comment on whether it was renegotiating=
 the deal with Dynegy. He also wouldn't speculate on whether the firm was co=
nsidering bankruptcy as an option if a new deal with Dynegy couldn't be work=
ed out.=20
A Dynegy spokesman said the status of the proposed merger has not changed. "=
Our due diligence is ongoing," he said.=20
Right now, credit rating agencies are hesitating before they downgrade Enron=
's ratings to junk status, which could further pressure Enron's day-to-day b=
usiness operations and lead it faster to insolvency.=20
"It's a fluid situation," said Ralph Pellecchia, senior director at New York=
 rating agency Fitch Inc., which has Enron's bond ratings at one level above=
 junk. "There's a lot of conjecture about Enron's dealings with Dynegy and t=
he banks. We'll just have to wait until there's another event or announcemen=
t before we act."=20
According to Fitch, Enron is sitting on about $1.8 billion in cash, $1.4 bil=

INDIA: Enron India unit, lenders to meet in UK this week.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Enron Corp's troubled Indian unit and its foreign=
 lenders will hold separate meetings this week to decide the fate of a power=
 project once considered the showpiece of India's reform programme, a bankin=
g source said on Tuesday.=20
The meetings, to be held in London on Friday and Saturday, will consider pro=
posals to allow the Dabhol Power Company, which is 65 percent owned by Enron=
, to pull the plug on a contract to sell power from a giant power project, h=
e said.
The $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct =
investment, has been shut since June this year following a dispute with its =
sole buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).=20
The departure of Enron and its partners would be another blow to attempts to=
 attract foreign investment into the domestic power sector.=20
Five foreign companies have either pulled out or announced plans to exit the=
 sector, fed up with bureaucratic delays and legal wrangling over the past f=
ew years.=20
At the same time, parent Enron Corp of the United States is struggling to wa=
rd off bankruptcy and save its proposed buyout by smaller rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Its share price has already taken a beating this year over widespread invest=
or doubts about its corporate governance practices. Enron shares closed down=
 73 cents, or 15.4 percent, at $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) o=
n Monday, after dipping to at least an 18-year-low of $3.76.=20
A Dabhol spokesman in Bombay confirmed that the Dabhol board is meeting in N=
ovember 30 in London. But he declined to disclose the agenda.=20
The banking source said the Dabhol board will consider giving the management=
 authorisation to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB.=20
Foreign lenders, led by Citibank and Bank of America, are meeting in London =
on the same day and will also consider giving Dabhol permission to issue suc=
h a notice.=20
Under a 1995 agreement between Dabhol and MSEB in 1995, the company needs le=
nders' permission before issuing a terminating notice.=20
Once issued, the notice would trigger international arbitration to resolve a=
rguments over damages.=20
MEGA PROJECT=20
Dabhol and MSEB have been feuding for more than a year over payment defaults=
 and high tariffs. The dispute stopped work on the second phase of the unit =
which is 97 percent complete.=20
Enron and its fellow U.S. investors General Electric Co and Bechtel, fed up =
with payment defaults, have already announced their intentions to exit the p=
roject.=20
They have agreed to sell their stake of 85 percent to either the Indian gove=
rnment or a private power company. At the same time, they have also proceede=
d with plans to cancel the contract.=20
A preliminary cancellation notice was issued in May this year. This was to b=
e followed up by a final termination notice after six months. That six-month=
 deadline expired on November 19.=20
But Dabhol was prevented from taking the final step by a Bombay court. Actin=
g on an urgent petition by Indian lenders, who were against the termination,=
 the court asked Dabhol not to issue such a notice until December 3.=20
The banking source said Dabhol is only trying to secure all approvals and wo=
uld not actually issue the notice on November 30.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Demand for electricity re-energises gas p=
roject.
By DAN WESTELL.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Demand for electricity re-energises gas p=
roject - After more than 20 years, gas pipeline companies are revisiting US/=
Canadian plans. writes Dan Westell.=20
The vision of a booming demand for electricity has brought a large part of t=
he North American natural gas pipeline industry together to revive a 20-year=
-old mega-project.
It was the late 1970s when the US and Canadian governments first approved a =
consortium to bring gas from the North Slope in Alaska to markets in the low=
er 48 states.=20
That project foundered as gas prices sagged, but last week, the original pip=
eline partners - six US and three Canadian companies - agreed to make a new =
approach to the Alaskan gas producers by the end of the year.=20
A second gas project, a proposal by Canadian producers who own undeveloped f=
ields in Canada's Arctic, is also hoping to launch a pipeline project this y=
ear.=20
After coming to terms with indigenous peoples in the north, the Canadian gro=
up hopes next month to begin preparing regulatory filings for a pipeline fro=
m the Mackenzie River Delta down the Mackenzie valley to the south.=20
After years of quiet in the northern energy front, there is a very real pros=
pect that gas from one project, or perhaps even both projects, could be flow=
ing by 2008.=20
Certainly, politics has something to do with the change, especially the reac=
tions to California's electricity problems and worries about security of sup=
ply, heightened by terrorism and problems in the Middle East.=20
For the companies, however, long-term pipeline projects are driven by foreca=
sts showing a nearly 50 per cent increase in US gas consumption by 2010.=20
The extra gas will largely be used to generate electricity, said Rocco Cianc=
io, spokesman for Foothills Pipe Lines, one of the three Canadian companies =
in the pipeline group that is preparing its pitch to the Alaskan producers.=20
The pipelines' revived interest in moving Alaskan gas was propelled by gas s=
pot prices, which hit USDollars 10.53 per mmBTU on January 2.=20
Other groups were already in motion, including the Canadian producers (led b=
y Imperial Oil), which have large undeveloped gas fields in the Mackenzie Ri=
ver Delta.=20
The North Slope producers - ExxonMobil, BP and Phillips - began their own st=
udy early this year to assess two routes: 1,800 miles running east under the=
 Beaufort Sea from Prudhoe Bay to the Mackenzie Delta, then south, or 2,100 =
miles following existing roads through the Alaskan interior to Alberta.=20
The higher prices are now a memory as gas has slid back to USDollars 2.50 pe=
r mmBTU, but the wheels on all three proposals continue to turn.=20
The pipeline group - Canada's TransCanada Pipelines and Westcoast Energy (wh=
ich together own Foothills) and affiliates of US companies Williams, Duke En=
ergy, Sempra Energy International, Enron, PG&E and El Paso - is planning a U=
SDollars 9.7bn project to carry 4bn cu ft a day. It needs a price of USDolla=
rs 3 per mmBTU to be viable.=20
The North Slope companies produce about 8bn cu ft of gas a day (a byproduct =
with oil) in Prudhoe Bay, but reinject it into the ground. There is no way o=
f getting it or the known reserves of 35,000bn cu ft, let alone the potentia=
l reserves of 100,000 cu ft, to market.=20
The preliminary results of their study, however, show a price of USDollars 3=
 per mmBTU and falls short of the 15 per cent return on equity target set in=
 the study, said spokesman Curtis Thayer.=20
They want to ship more gas than the pipelines are proposing, requiring a big=
ger pipe, and believe the project will require not just the new northern pip=
eline, but expansion of the existing 1,800-mile system between Alberta and C=
hicago to handle the increased volume.=20
All in, they have priced the Alaska route at USDollars 17.2bn, and the Beauf=
ort-Mackenzie route at USDollars 15.1bn.=20
New technology or changes in project parameters could cut the cost, bridging=
 some of the gap between the Foothills group and the producers. But the prod=
ucers are also pushing governments to lower regulatory costs and bring more =
certainty to tax issues.=20

THE AMERICAS - Bolivia urged to handle its new-found wealth with care.
By PAUL KELLER.

11/27/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

THE AMERICAS - Bolivia urged to handle its new-found wealth with care - GAS =
RESERVES - The country needs to diversify its customer base if energy discov=
eries are to prove a long-term cure for economic ills - and an alternative t=
o the cocaine trade. Paul Keller reports.=20
The discovery of large natural gas reserves in Bolivia has led some to belie=
ve that the landlocked South American country has found a long-term cure for=
 its economic ills - and an alternative to the cocaine trade.
True, reserves are plentiful, analysts say, but an excess of supply and the =
risk that this fragile Andean economy comes to rely too heavily on hydrocarb=
on revenues suggest Bolivia must handle gas with care.=20
"We have told the government, gas is not the saviour of Bolivia," says Steve=
n Hopper, the general manager of Transredes, the Enron-Shell gas transport u=
tility. "This is a critical time for Bolivia as it has to find markets for i=
ts gas. The industry is generally optimistic. The worst scenario is that gas=
 demand in Brazil doesn't grow."=20
The strategy of President Jorge Quiroga, a 41-year-old technocrat who took o=
ver from ailing ex-President Hugo Banzer in August, is to help Bolivia go fr=
om being a world coca leaf grower to gas producer and regional energy hub. I=
t is a strategy, analysts say, already paying dividends.=20
"Bolivia is only now beginning to realise some of the return on its gas flow=
ing to Brazil," says one western observer. "Gas is seen as leading element i=
n mid-to long-term recovery."=20
To speed up the anticipated benefits, Bolivia is considering selling securit=
ies backed by tax receipts from future gas sales. The government plans to se=
curitise one-third of the income from gas sales to Brazil over the next 19 y=
ears.=20
The $8.3bn mining and agriculture-dominated economy, one of Latin America's =
smallest, has been in a three-year downturn as internal demand evaporates an=
d the value of exports plummets. US-sponsored eradication of coca and cocain=
e production also removed a significant chunk of revenue.=20
Thus the riches and influence promised by gas symbolise hope in a country be=
tter known in recent decades for social turmoil, military coups, Nazi asylum=
-seekers and the once-omnipresent drugs trade.=20
Oil and gas were the only industrial sectors to show growth this year. In th=
e first seven months gas production rose by 47.9 per cent year on year. Outp=
ut of oil - extracted during gas production - grew 16.1 per cent.=20
Gearing up for greater Brazilian demand, capacity is being increased on Boli=
via's existing gas pipeline. A Petrobras, Repsol-YPF and TotalFinaElf consor=
tium hopes to start building a rival pipeline.=20
But for the multinationals that have invested in Bolivia's gas market, the w=
orry is that southern cone demand will not keep pace with supply.=20
Although not as big as Bolivia's reserves, Argentina and Peru also have gas =
to develop and export. While Brazil has vast energy needs, Bolivia needs to =
diversify its gas customer base, analysts say.=20
With proven and probable Bolivian reserves of 46,800bn cu ft and another 23,=
200bn cu ft of possible reserves, only Venezuela, with 143,000bn cu ft of re=
serves, has more gas in South America.=20
The amount of gas found has grown eightfold since Bolivia opened up its gas =
market in 1997. However current demand for gas in the southern cone is estim=
ated at around only 10,500bn cu ft.=20
In the quest for new markets, the government has backed a plan to ship natur=
al gas to the energy-hungry US West Coast. But even with strong commercial b=
acking, the $6bn project - led by Pacific LNG, a consortium made up of Spain=
's Repsol-YPF, British Gas and British Petroleum - must still negotiate a nu=
mber of political and technical hurdles to succeed, analysts say.=20
The project in its present form requires a $1bn, 700km pipeline across the A=
ndes linking the Chilean coast with Bolivia's largest gas field, Margarita, =
owned by the consortium.=20
Liquefied gas could then be shipped to Mexico and piped into the US. It all =
needs careful negotiation both with the governments involved and US gas dist=
ributors. But La Paz is optimistic that the project will be shipping gas to =
the US within five years.=20
Mr Quiroga, who steps down next year, has spearheaded efforts to open up the=
 US gas market. He recently predicted gas would "open doors" for Bolivia.=20
He also hopes to persuade Chile to grant it access to the Pacific in return =
for choosing a Chilean port as the site for a $2bn liquefaction plant needed=
 in the Pacific LNG project. Peru is vying to receive Bolivian gas, but anal=
ysts expect Chile to win out.=20
However, analysts continue to warn Mr Quiroga not to overplay the "gas card"=
, bearing in mind both that the industry will not create masses of new jobs =
as well as the country's over-reliance in the past on expendable resources s=
uch as silver and tin.=20
Luis Felipe Rivero, the general manager of the financial group Bisa, says: "=
There are great expectations that gas will become one of the principal gener=
ators of revenue and a creator of investment in Bolivia.=20
"But because of these expectations, there is a risk of letting slip the coun=
try's basic problems which are a lack of education, a lack of health service=
s, lack of job opportunities and corruption."=20

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.
By Andrew Kelly

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes =
heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit e=
mployee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement pla=
ns.=20
"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings =
before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amo=
unt of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener=
 asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on be=
half of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated=
 $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts.=20
The suit is one of four filed against Enron that alleges the company breache=
d its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock=
 at artificially inflated prices.=20
Two similar suits were announced last week and the Seattle law firm of Dalto=
n Gotto Samson & Kilgard also announced one on Monday. All four suits seek c=
lass-action status.=20
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5=
 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures=
 about its deteriorating finances.=20
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employe=
es' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to h=
old the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50.=20
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirem=
ent accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retir=
ement plan's administrator.=20
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 pe=
rcent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) pla=
ns offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their po=
rtfolio in that stock.=20
"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional=
 defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobb=
y, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said.=20
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "complet=
ely indefensible," he said.=20
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by of=
fering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If=
 proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he sa=

USA: Calif. Attorney Gen'l to examine Dynegy-Enron deal.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov 26 (Reuters) - California's attorney general will ex=
amine Dynegy Inc.'s bid to buy its much larger energy rival, Enron Corp. , o=
fficials said Monday, adding a potential new wrinkle to the troubled $9 bill=
ion merger proposal.=20
"We are reviewing the merger for anti-trust concerns," said Sandra Michioku,=
 spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
Michioku said it was still far too early to say what position California wou=
ld take on the proposed merger, which involves two companies often publicly =
blamed for helping to create California's energy crisis this year.=20
Dynegy was among five energy companies named in a lawsuit filed in May by Lt=
=2E Gov. Cruz Bustamante alleging energy price manipulation at several south=
ern California power plants it owns. Dynegy has denied the accusation.=20
Enron, while owning no generation plants in California, is a major national =
player for energy trading and natural gas transmission - which if merged wit=
h Dynegy's market presence in the state could create a major new energy powe=
rhouse.=20
The proposed merger, which has been plagued by uncertainty amid news of majo=
r new Enron debt and a resulting slump in its share price, is already being =
examined by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory C=
ommission.=20
California regulators could present a roadblock to successful completion of =
the deal. But the state could also leverage its influence over the merger to=
 renegotiate a number of long-term energy deals with Dynegy, which it signed=
 months ago at the height of its power crisis and which are now being critic=

Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2)
2001-11-27 00:23 (New York)

Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2)

     (Adds reports on stock ratio and bank extensions in seventh
and eighth paragraphs.)

     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may renegotiate
terms of its proposed $22.9 billion purchase of Enron Corp., whose
shares have fallen 54 percent since the merger was announced,
people familiar with talks between the companies said.

     Executives of the two energy-trading companies discussed
possible changes in the terms over the weekend, the people said.
The offer made on Nov. 9 values Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy
stock. Enron's stock closed at $4.01, indicating investors don't
believe the sale will be completed under the original terms.

     Enron is seeking as much as $2 billion in equity investment
and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to downgrade the
credit rating of the energy trader, which said last week its debt
was higher than earlier reported. Enron needs to offer more
attractive terms or risk losing the support of Dynegy investors
for a deal needed to save the company, analysts said.

     ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file
for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris
Harris.

     Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman
John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

                            Half Price?

     Enron and Dynegy are talking about cutting the ratio to less
than 0.15, which would value the stock portion of the transaction
at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per Enron share, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions.

     In addition, the companies may announce as early as today an
extension by some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500
million cash infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co., and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite
lawsuits over Enron's employee-retirement plan, the New York Times
said.

     ``If they can renegotiate the deal to half (the original
price), that's where you get really attractive earnings,'' said
Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a
``buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more, Howald said. Barone has reduced his
estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings from $1.65 a share to 75 cents.
     Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25.

                       Additional Financing

     New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the
additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors
said.

     ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that
kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses --
trading, pipelines and energy management -- are still sound,''
said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets
in the Strong Utilities Fund, 4.3 percent of which is Dynegy
stock.

    Enron has debt payments of more than $9 billion due before the
end of 2002, and has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines
left, the company said in a filing last week. If its cash reserves
run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment
grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two
affiliated partnerships.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed a 10-Q quarterly report with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Nov. 9, it rated
Enron's debt one notch above junk. The rating company's analysts
didn't return calls seeking comment today.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB,'' a level below investment grade.

                             Write-Off

     The Houston-based company also said in the filing that it had
a $690 million note due this week, and that it may have to reduce
fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million. The write-off would come
because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated
partnership, and the value of that stock has plunged.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line.
Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was
``encouraged'' by the developments.

     Enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt, Denne
said today. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup executives met today to line
up investors willing to buy $2 billion in bonds convertible into
Enron stock.

     Many of Enron's trading partners are shunning the company,
and some analysts now say Enron's 2002 earnings may hurt, rather
than boost, Dynegy's earnings, as Watson has projected.

                        Deteriorating Daily

     ``The value of the assets Dynegy is trying to buy -- the
trading and marketing businesses -- are deteriorating on a daily
basis as more counterparties back off on trading and dealing with
Enron,'' said Mike Heim, a securities analyst at A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc.

     Watson said on Nov. 9 that the merger would increase Houston-
based Dynegy's 2002 earnings by 35 percent to $3.40 to $3.50 a
share.

     To realize those gains, Watson will have to help Enron stay
out of bankruptcy by helping it get financing, Vuchetich said.

    ``Dynegy needs to make sure there's no hint the trading
operation is worth less than they thought,'' Vuchetich said. ``It
has to be kept running to maintain its value.''

Enron Faces New Employee Suit Alleging Securities Violations

Enron Faces New Employee Suit Alleging Securities Violations

     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the energy
trader and producer whose shares hit a 14-year low today, is being
sued for allegedly violating federal securities law by selling
employees company stock without a prospectus.

     The suit was filed in Houston by Gary Kemper, a 57-year-old
maintenance foreman at an Enron affiliate, and seeks to recover
$850 million in losses, said his attorney, Eli Gottesdiener. The
suit claims Enron prevented employees under the age of 50 from
selling stock they received from the company as 401(k) matching
contributions.

     Houston-based Enron, whose bond and stock prices fell amid
concern Dynegy Inc. may abandon its $23 billion proposed bid for
the company, faces at least two other lawsuits seeking to recover
losses from employee 401(k) accounts. The previous suits did not
raise the prospectus claim.

     Enron shares fell 70 cents to $4.01 after trading as low as
$3.76 today. They've dropped 95 percent this year. Company
spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the suit, citing
the company's policy on pending litigation.

California Agency Must Generate Revenue, Analyst Says (Update3)

California Agency Must Generate Revenue, Analyst Says (Update3)

     (Adds long-term contract proposal in 11th to 14th
paragraphs.)

     Sacramento, California, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California's
new power authority may have a hard time paying off bonds, as it
shifts focus from building power plants to financing conservation
programs, a state analyst said.

     The authority plans to encourage power conservation by paying
for solar power-panels on houses and other energy-efficiency
programs. That won't provide the revenue needed to secure long-
term bonds and entice investors, said Keely Bosler of the state
Legislative Analyst's Office. Power-plant bonds are secured by the
sale of electricity.

     ``Given the current focus of the power authority on demand-
side management projects, it's essentially unclear how the bond
authority will work,'' Bosler said at a Senate hearing to evaluate
the authority. ``We may want to look at other ones that would be
more efficient and effective in terms of providing the
financing.''

     The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing
Authority was created in August. It has the authority to sell $5
billion in bonds to ensure the state has enough electricity to
meet demand. Millions of Californians saw their power go out this
year when officials ordered rolling blackouts on days when demand
threatened to exceed supply.

     The authority scaled back it focus on building plants that
are run on fossil fuels because the state is now expected to have
a surplus of electricity next year. The authority had planned on
spending $4 billion on building power plants and $1 billion on
conservation efforts. The surplus is the result of new power
plants and state-wide conservation efforts.

                         Boom Time

     ``We think that we are in a boom at the moment,'' said Steve
Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission.
     The authority wants to build or own a 15 percent reserve of
energy supply to prevent further blackouts. With a surplus
predicted for next year, how the authority builds that reserve is
in question.

     The authority has suspended several letters of intent signed
with power generating companies for fossil fuel plants, said S.
David Freeman, chairman of the authority. Enron Corp. and Reliant
Energy Inc. both have agreements to build and operate gas-fired
plants. It was unclear if those contracts were affected.

     ``The bulk of our work, almost all of our projects, will
occur after we've completed our investment plan,'' Freeman said.
``Right now our main job is to determine the feasible use of
conservation and renewable sources.''

     The authority has a budget of $10 million, loaned by the
state Legislature to manage its operations through the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2002. Following that, the authority is expected to
finance it operations from revenue bond proceeds.

                     Long-Term Contracts

     The authority has acknowledged that it won't be able to sell
any of its $5 billion in bonds as long as state leaders and
regulators are deadlocked over repaying electricity-buying costs.
That same dispute is holding up the sale of $12.5 billion in bonds
needed to pay back the state's general fund spent buying
electricity.

     Freeman suggested that the power authority could take over
management of the $43 billion in long-term power contracts the
state signed in January to buy power for insolvent utilities. Once
the power authority has control of the contracts, it could promise
generators cheap loans from bond proceeds if the companies agree
to renegotiate the contracts.

     California Governor Gray Davis has said the contracts were
needed to bring stability to California's energy market. Since
then, the cost of power has dropped, leaving California with
contracts to buy electricity above spot-market prices.

     ``It's an abstract thought and I don't have any numbers
behind it,'' Freeman said. ``It could be something that could bear
fruit, and it might not.''

Enron Plunges, but Dynegy Will Suffer, Too

In the Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) endgame, both players look set t=
o lose.=20
The other player is energy trader Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) , wh=
ich this month agreed to buy Enron. Since the deal was announced, Enron's fu=
ndamentals have rapidly deteriorated, making Dynegy's offer look ridiculousl=
y generous. But even if the deal gets done at more advantageous terms, Dyneg=
y will struggle to revive a disembowled Enron and absorb its hefty debt load=
=2E=20
Making matters worse, Dynegy could suffer just as much if it backs out of th=
e deal. Without a merger, Houston-based Enron almost certainly goes to the w=
all, causing disruption, stress and profit-sapping change in the energy mark=
et. How can Dynegy not get wounded in that environment? The stock market doe=
sn't seem to agree, however; Dynegy shares remain above their predeal levels=
=2E=20
Wishful Thinking
A Dynegy spokesman says his company can post annual earnings growth of 20% t=
o 25% over the next two years even without Enron. He declined to comment on =
the merger negotiations, except to say that Dynegy is "continuing its due di=
ligence" of Enron. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on deal talks.=20
Where do things stand as of Monday evening? Well, the deal looks increasingl=
y unlikely to happen (at least on the terms of Nov. 9). After a sickening sl=
ide last week, Enron tanked again Monday, dropping 15% to $4.01. Current dea=
l terms have Dynegy paying around $10.50 an Enron share based on its current=
 stock price. A 60% gap says the deal won't get done. But, as the world and =
his wife now know, the deal needs to go through for Enron to maintain the in=
vestment grade credit rating necessary for its survival.=20
Clearly, every hour counts in this fast-unwinding situation. Enron's core tr=
ading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to th=
e company, draining it of precious cash.=20
As a result, two options exist from here. The first is a rescue effort invol=
ving Dynegy, the rating agencies and bank creditors like J.P. Morgan Chase a=
nd Citigroup, working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to b=
uy Enron time. This could involve changing the stock-swap ratio to give Dyne=
gy a cheaper price, with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with =
other investors to inject equity.=20
The other scenario has Dynegy, after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skel=
etons in the closet, deciding to back out altogether, leaving Enron with no =
rescuer and no future. But Dynegy's resilient stock price suggests that the =
market hasn't grasped the impact an Enron bankruptcy would have on Dynegy an=
d other trading firms.=20
Don't be at all surprised if, any moment now, we see one last attempt to sal=
vage Dynegy's rescue merger with new terms. Several banks are exposed to Enr=
on and, presumably, they will try almost anything -- including extending deb=
t -- to keep the company afloat. By keeping deeply distressed Enron at an in=
vestment-grade rating, rating agencies such as Moody's have shown themselves=
 willing to bend to the banks' wishes, so they will probably capitulate agai=
n if pressured by bank honchos.=20
Be Careful What You Wish For
But swallowing Enron would hardly be good for Dynegy, which appears to have =
underestimated the former's problems.=20
Amazingly, just a couple of weeks back, the company expected Enron to make $=
1.50 per share in 2002. Goldman Sachs is now expecting 50 cents, even if the=
 merger gets done. If Dynegy ended up paying, say, $3 a share for Enron, peo=
ple would no doubt hail that as a low-enough price to cover worsened fundame=
ntals, legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from Enro=
n's notoriously murky books. But recall that Dynegy also would be taking on =
Enron's $13 billion of debt. Include the debt in some return-on-capital calc=
ulations and the deal still looks untenable.=20
Alternatively, Enron may be deteriorating too fast to save. That's also bad =
for Dynegy. The damage done to the company by depleted energy market activit=
y has been recognized, as has the risk that an Enron collapse could leave Dy=
negy dangerously unhedged on many of its trades. What does that mean and why=
 is it dangerous? Let's say Dynegy agreed to buy power from Company X over a=
 period of time and then sell it to Enron. If Enron goes down, its obligatio=
n to buy from Dynegy obviously disappears, but Dynegy can't easily back out =
of the commitment to buy power from Company X.=20
And there's another potential risk that the market really hasn't recognized.=
 Enron allegedly was very aggressive in booking upfront profits on forward m=
arket deals. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on that allegation. Thos=
e deals had to be done with other trading houses, possibly Dynegy.=20
In other words, Enron's ways may have contaminated the whole market because,=
 as we are frequently told, Enron was the energy market, just as Drexel Burn=
ham was the junk bond market in the '80s. In Enron's absence, many of the ag=
gressive deals may have to be unwound. Meanwhile, auditors, in a frantic bid=
 to cover their behinds, would start telling trading companies to be a lot m=
ore conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals. Suddenly, fa=
t margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get slashed.=20
Checkmate -- for both sides.=20
