Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have=
 entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this mean=
s they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can a=
dvise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the comp=
anies listed here today as it relates to the state of California.=20
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing =
and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group.=20

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action a=
gainst the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with M=
ark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.=20

BT =20
