Ed - we have another site on NGPL that will need a C.A.  The good news is we=
=20
can duplicate the May 31 C.A. with the following exceptions:

1)  Replace "Chicago, Illinois" with "Bollinger County, Missouri".
2)  Delete 8.a.  (There is no previous C.A. in existence for Missouri).

I need to turn this around ASAP.

Thanks
