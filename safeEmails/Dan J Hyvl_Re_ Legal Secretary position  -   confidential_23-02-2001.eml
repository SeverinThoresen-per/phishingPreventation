applicants:

 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than=20
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek

 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp=
=20

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process=
