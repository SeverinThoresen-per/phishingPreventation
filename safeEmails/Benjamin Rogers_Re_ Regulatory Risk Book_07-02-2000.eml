Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the=20
entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust=20
the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the=
=20
group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in=20
yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not=
=20
come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff,=20
but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the=20
case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again=
