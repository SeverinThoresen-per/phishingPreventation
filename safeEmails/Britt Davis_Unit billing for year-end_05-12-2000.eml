Mike, Louis, and Drew,

This follows up on my e-mails to you and my conversations with Mike about=20
this subject.  We want to make sure that you are not caught in a year-end=20
problem if you want to get the usual December estimates for Unit bills. =20
Unfortunately, as Becky indicates, if we do not receive your instructions=20
regarding this by December 12 at the very latest, then it will be too late=20
for us to do what you want.

I assume that if you want December estimates, you will also want them from=20
outside counsel.  Last year, it took a good deal of time to get those=20
estimates from the attorneys representing your (and other Enron entities')=20
interests in the Grynberg/Quinque cases.  I have received no instructions=20
from you with regard to these or any other outside counsel.=20

We greatly value our representation of the GPG and want to help in any way w=
e=20
can.  Please let us know what we can do.

Britt =20

Britt, I am finalizing the Unit billing schedule for December and I need som=
e=20
information.  We will be sending out the bills for the November time on=20
December 14th.  After that, we will issue another billing for December 1 - 1=
4=20
time.  Those bills will go out the last week of December.  If the GPG wants=20
to have estimates for the remainder of December time, then we need to know=20
that by December 12th, at the very latest.  Please let me know their wishes=20
as soon as you find out.  Thanks, Becky
