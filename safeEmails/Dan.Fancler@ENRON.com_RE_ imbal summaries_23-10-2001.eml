Prices should close above last month so we don't expect an imbalance revalua=
tion hit in October.  We will continue monitoring prices, at this time the m=
argin is too small to count for much.

Richard Hanagriff, at the staff meeting today TW linepack was too full, is t=
his due to imbalance payback in?  If so who is doing it.  Call me and we wil=
l discuss.
