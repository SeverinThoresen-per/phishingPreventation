Kim:

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet fo=
r=20
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of thing=
s=20
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have=
=20
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas=20
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily=20
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be=20
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a=20
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk shoul=
d=20
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the dea=
l=20
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this=20
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  W=
e=20
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA an=
d=20
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this=20
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase=20
the demand charge for orig.=20

Call me first thing on Monday
