Hi there -

Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!! =
=20

I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role tha=
t=20
you and I discussed in San Antonio.

As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling=20
more and more exposed.

As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to=20
nail it down.

I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office=20
focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  =
I=20
know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back=
=20
office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key=20
controls.



Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with=
=20
Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be=20
sooner.

I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and=20
packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.

but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639

Keep me posted

Beth
