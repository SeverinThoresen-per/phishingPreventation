Please work with Tom and the trading group to arrange an after work get toge=
ther for the Texas team (admin and support included).  We should have it at =
a place where we can get a semi-private room serving food and cocktails. The=
 idea is to have a holiday party to get to know each other.  The origination=
 team will also be signing holiday cards to send out to our customers, so we=
 need to do it sooner (late Nov or early Dec), so the cards the be delivered=
=2E  Gary Bryan can give you some ideas.

Did we ever decide about our Xmas card signing? Were we going to do it at yo=
ur home with spouses or w/o spouses after work with cocktails? I would like =
to get to know the guys on the Texas desk and after work one afternoon might=
 be fun. Can we try for a Tuesday or Thursday? The reason I mention this is =
that I received a Xmas card from a customer today. We should go ahead and or=
der cards and get a list together ASAP. The date will be fast upon us.=20
=20
Also, I would like to order something like a Greenberg turkey for several of=
 my better customers. Do you have a problem with that this year? If you like=
 I could include several of your key customers as well.

I also requested Michael get Morris a RIM as well as a phone.

In case we miss each other Tuesday, I will be meeting with the VP of TotalFi=
naElf regarding supplying gas under the Frontera transaction, talking about =
several of their chemical plants in addition to discuss trading with them da=
ily. After lunch I will be meeting with BP Amoco to talk about several plant=
 deliveries as well as look at daily trading with them. (Morris was unable t=
o make either of these meeting but when he gets onboard I will pass of the s=
upply part of these accounts to him.

I can be reached on my cell phone and maybe my RIM!=20
