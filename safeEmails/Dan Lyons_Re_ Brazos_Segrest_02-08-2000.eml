Dan - We received a copy of Phil Segrest's letter re the "interrogatories".
In an effort to be co-operative, there are probably a number of things to
which we can respond - but a number of others are confidential (a copy of
the option) or dangerous (the experience of Ponderosa in operating similar
facilities).  Let us know how you want to respond.  John H
