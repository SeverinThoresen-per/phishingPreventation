Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder=20
Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were=20
interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in=20
the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as=20
possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per=20
plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave the=
m=20
the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000=
=20
per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they=20
still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them -=
=20
1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with =
a=20
non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know=20
if you have any comments.  Thank you!
