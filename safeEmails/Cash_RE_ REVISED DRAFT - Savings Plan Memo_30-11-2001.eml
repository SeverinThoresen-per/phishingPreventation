Subject:	REVISED DRAFT - Savings Plan Memo


Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board o=
f Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amend=
ment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

=B7	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paych=
eck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash matc=
h will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for t=
he Plan. =20

=B7	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contribu=
tions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contri=
butions to the Plan.

=B7	Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will now be allow=
ed, regardless of your age, from ALL company contribution accounts.  This re=
moves the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the=
 company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all pr=
ior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts. =20

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Realloca=
tion" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your re=
stricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts=
: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the=
 web at http://hewitt.resources.com/enron  or through benefits.enron.com.
