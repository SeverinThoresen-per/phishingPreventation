Also, spoke with Pug re joint meeting and he nthinks we need 2 hours for it =
and probably won't be able to discuss international assets and lessons learn=
ed this time around.Is there anyway we can increase time for joint meeting t=
o 2 hours, and have audit and finance as well? Pug really wants to leave ade=
quate time to discuss limits etc. He also wants to be sure that all BOD feel=
 they are invited. How do we do that? Rick
