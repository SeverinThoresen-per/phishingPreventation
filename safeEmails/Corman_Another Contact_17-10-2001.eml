Subject: Question About Flat Stanley Project



Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail s=
oon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly=
 tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envel=
ope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with scho=
ol.  At first he expected to be=20
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy h=
ow things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergart=
en was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kid=
s.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up =
at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her =
orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was=
 watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how mu=
ch they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project fo=
r the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just =
wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received=
=20
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & addres=
s=20
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's=20
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can=20
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom
