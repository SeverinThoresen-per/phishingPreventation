Hi Jeff,=20
Thanks for speaking last Wednesday on 29, it was my first floor meeting with=
 you and I found it informative.  I like your informal, "no bones about it" =
style, a style I wish more people would adopt.

During the meeting you had made some references about your previous guest wh=
ich concerned me.  As an employee and shareholder in Enron, it occurred to m=
e that some of the comments would not benefit Enron if they were ever leaked=
 out to the press, (ie. like the Houston Chronicle article on the PRC proces=
s).

I do have one question to ask, with your light hearted comment about "Air In=
dia"; In order to achieve the vision of being the "World's Leading Company" =
do you anticipate we will further develop business activities within existin=
g areas, or do you anticipate Enron becoming involved in entirely new busine=
ss areas?  In other words, do you see us building new businesses which repre=
sent a natural evolution of our current activities, or do you anticipate som=
ething more radical?  A couple of months ago you said in an interview that y=
ou will continue running the company, in a business as usual fashion, will t=
hat change?


Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.=20
