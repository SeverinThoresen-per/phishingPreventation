Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas=20
for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it t=
o=20
Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to=20
change on this deal.

Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport=20
CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport=20
numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract=20
k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, =20
we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits=
=20
we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.
