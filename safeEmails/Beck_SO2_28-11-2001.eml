Bradford called last night - some problem with SO2 marks.  Bill thought that=
 our curves were way off.  Sounds as if that is not the problem but instead =
that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only inter=
company deals and not third party deals.  Book wasn't picked up in Credit's =
exposure, making it look as if we were off on our mark versus Barclay's mark=
 by $20MM.  I have gotten one story from Brent.  What do you know about this=
?  --Sally=20
