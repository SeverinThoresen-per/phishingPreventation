Elizabeth,
For various reasons, and from time to time,  these new RTO-type things come=20
to legal because we presumably have some special "corporate law" expertise=20
about board compostition and by-laws.  I'm not sure we do, but in any event,=
 =20
Steve and I have reviewed this three inch pile of paper and our conclusions=20
are set forth below.  If you would like us to do anything further, please le=
t=20
us know. ----cgy

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and=
=20
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.=
 =20

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and=20
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation=
=20
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitat=
e=20
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric=20
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully=20
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards=20
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers,=20
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors=20
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors=20
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of=20
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass=20
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one=20
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a=20
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two=20
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately,=20
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC=20
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk=20
this presents. =20

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization ("WIO") will be formed=
=20
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the=20
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional=20
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA,=
=20
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a=20
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these=20
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional=20
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards,=20
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Wester=
n=20
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to=20
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and=20
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following=20
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of=20
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of=20
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of=20
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or=20
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers,=20
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of=20
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western=20
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total=20
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
=20
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three=20
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors=20
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning=20
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface=20
Committee. =20

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board,=20
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2)=20
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Clas=
s=20
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple=20
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer=20
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the=20
members.
