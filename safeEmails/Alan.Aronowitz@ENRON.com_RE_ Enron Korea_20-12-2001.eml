I just spoke with YH Jo of Kim & Chang. He advises that payment of salaries =
to employees of ECT Korea Branch will not attract any liability to the branc=
h representative (ie. John Nowlan) notwithstanding that there may not be eno=
ugh funds to meet all liabilities.

Tiong Hock is still checking on what other liabilities the branch has but hi=
s initial impression is that they are mostly inter company debts.

I will double check the  position with PWC Korea when I speak with them late=
r with Chor Lim and Anthony.

Regards
Matt
