My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity=20
unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of i=
s=20
will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity.

Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections?

Does this affect us?  If so, how?  Thanks Chris.

Hi Molly,

I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbi=
a
Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in
case, I though you might like to know about this.

Sorry I am not much of a help here.

Thanks!
