Enron's 2nd-Qtr Profit Rises 40% on Electricity Sales (Update5)
2001-07-12 16:25 (New York)

Enron's 2nd-Qtr Profit Rises 40% on Electricity Sales (Update5)

     (Updates shares.  Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the top energy
trader, said second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as its sales of
natural gas and electricity surged in the U.S. and Europe.
     Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a share, from
$289 million, or 34 cents, in the year-earlier period, Enron said.
Revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion. The Houston-based company
sold almost twice as much power in North America and five times as
much in Europe than in the year-earlier quarter.
     Though electricity and natural-gas prices surged in
California, Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling said the state
``is just not a big factor'' in Enron's increasing profits. The
Houston-based company boosts earnings by increasing sales of
energy and other commodities such as lumber and steel rather than
raising prices, analysts said.
     ``That's the nature of the commodities business,'' said Zach
Wagner, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. who has a ``buy''
rating on Enron. ``As markets open up, their volumes will grow.
Their margins are basically flat.''
     Enron's profit margin was less than 1 percent last year and
has averaged 2.1 percent during the past five years, based on
Bloomberg data. That compares to a profit margin of 6.5 percent
for Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest publicly traded energy company.
     Shares of Enron have dropped 31 percent during the past year
despite steadily increasing earnings, and sales that now rival
those of Exxon Mobil.

                         Broadband Meltdown

      Investors are concerned about lackluster results from the
company's broadband business, which was set up to trade space on
fiber-optic telecommunications networks. Enron shares surged
87 percent last year when the boom in Internet and
telecommunications businesses seemed certain to increase demand
for broadband capacity. Enron shares fell 40 percent this year as
the boom fizzled.
     The broadband business had a loss before interest, minority
interests and taxes of $102 million in the second quarter,
compared with an $8 million loss a year earlier. Broadband revenue
plunged 89 percent to $16 million from $151 million. Enron said it
is firing broadband staff to reduce costs.
     ``There's a meltdown out there,' Skilling said. ``You have to
do very short-term transactions (in broadband) because people
don't have the credit to do long-term transactions.''
     Investors are questioning whether Enron can continue to post
huge gains in sales in its energy and commodity businesses,
analysts said. The earnings news today left the stock up
45 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $49.55.
     ``It was telecommunications that took the stock to its lofty
height . . .  and disappointment with telecommunications that has
held the stock back,'' Wagner said. ``What they're trading at now
is purely as an energy company.''
      Spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to say how many people will
be fired or where the cuts would take place in the company's
broadband business. Enron has broadband staff in Houston, London,
Singapore and Portland, Oregon. Denne said Enron would try to find
internal jobs for the broadband workers and only cut those
employees it can't place.
     In a conference call, Skilling said the broadband business
still has potential.
    ``We're getting a negative impact on our stock price from the
broadband business, and I don't think that's right,'' Skilling
said.

                         Buyer and Seller

     Skilling and his predecessor, Ken Lay, have transformed a
natural gas-pipeline company into the biggest competitor in the
business of trading commodities such as gas and power. Enron also
uses financial instruments such as futures contracts to help
protect customers from swings in energy prices.
     Enron says it makes money regardless of whether prices go up
or down in California because it is both a buyer and a seller in
the markets where it operates, making much of its money from fees
for arranging trades. It also profits from selling risk management
contracts to utilities and other companies that want to lock in
energy prices.
     Enron was expected to make 42 cents a share in the quarter,
the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Enron reiterated its 2001 profit forecast of $1.80 a
share and said it expects to make $2.15 in 2002. The First Call
estimate for 2002 was $2.12.
     Enron's revenue tripled from $16.9 billion in the year-
earlier quarter. Most of the gain came from Enron's Wholesale
Services business, which includes commodities trading and
development of energy projects such as power plants.
     Earlier this year, Enron estimated it was owed as much as
$500 million for California energy sales. Skilling said he thinks
California prices have stabilized and the state is going to get
through the summer ``just fine.'' While electricity and natural
gas prices in the West are up from a year ago, they are down from
the first quarter.
     ``The financial impact on Enron is over now,'' Skilling said.

                         European Expansion

     Enron had first-half revenue of $100.2 billion, almost equal
its revenue for all of last year. Skilling has predicted revenue
will top $200 billion this year, rivaling Exxon Mobil's
$232 billion in 2000 sales.
     Enron is continuing to expand its trading business in Europe.
The company entered Europe ahead of its competition and became the
dominant trader there, said Bob Christensen, a First Albany
analyst who rates Enron a ``strong buy.''
     ``We have just started down the path in Europe,'' Skilling
said. ``Look for great things from Europe in the future.''
     In California and other parts of the U.S., Enron has a
growing business in contracts that manage energy supply for big
customers such as Owens-Illinois Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co.
Contracts increased 89 percent to $7.2 billion in the quarter,
Enron said.
     The energy-services unit's profit increased 30 percent to $60
million in the quarter, and the business is on track to make $225
million this year, more than double 2000's results, Enron said.
     Profit was little changed at Enron's pipeline and utility
businesses, which are more closely regulated than the trading
operations. Enron has a 25,000-mile gas pipeline system and owns
Portland General, an Oregon utility.
     The company reported a loss of $109 million for higher
``corporate-wide expenses.'' About a quarter of that was from its
Azurix water unit, Skilling said. The loss compares with profit of
$17 million a year earlier.


Enron's Skilling Sees California Energy Crisis Easing (Update2)

Enron's Skilling Sees California Energy Crisis Easing (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price.)

     Houston, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said higher retail prices for electricity in
California has curtailed power demand and should lead to fewer
blackouts than expected this summer.
     ``The expectation of higher retail prices has dampened demand
considerably,'' Skilling said in a conference call with analysts
and investors. ``I think we're going to get through the summer
just fine in California. That will ultimately lead to lower
wholesale prices for power.''
     The state had been facing about 15 hours of blackouts a week
this summer, the North American Electric Reliability Council, a
national group that monitors and coordinates U.S. power supplies,
said in May. California has been spared outages recently because
of conservation efforts, cooler temperatures and new power plants.
     Prices for power and natural gas in California should stay
close to current levels because of the drop in demand, Skilling
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
     Power plants producing enough energy for about 1.2 million
homes have opened this summer in California, California Governor
Gray Davis said yesterday in a statement.
     ``We're not out of the woods yet, but we are making
progress,'' Davis said.
     California is seeking $8.9 billion in refunds from generators
such as Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, for power
bought in the last year. Under the formula used by California to
derive that figure, Enron is actually owed $44 million because it
bought more power than it sold since May 2000, Skilling said.
     Shares of Enron rose 45 cents to $49.55. The company said
today second-quarter profit rose 40 percent as higher sales of
electricity more than made up for a loss in its telecommunications
business.
     Enron stock has fallen 40 percent this year. The political
rhetoric surrounding the California crisis and negotiations over
possible refunds has hurt Enron's stock price, Skilling said.
     ``All this noise from California has obscured the performance
of the company,'' Skilling said.

              Energy earnings:  Enron reporting second quarter earnings,
              forty-five cents a share, beating expectations of forty-two
              cents a share.  Surpassing last year's earnings of
              thirty-four cents.  Net income roes forty percent to
              four-hundred-four million dollars.  Revenue up one-hundred
              and ninety-five percent to fifty-billion.  (Graphic:  Enron
              (ENE):  Actual $0.45, Estimate $0.42, Year Ago $0.34,
              Revenue up 195% to $50.06b, Net Income up 40% to $404m)
              Enron said revenue numbers were driven by a surge in
              wholesale services business.  Stock is trading at a
              fifty-two week range, forty-two to ninety.  Right now at
              the low end, around forty-nine yesterday.  Let's take a
              closer look at the numbers.  Joining us now is Enron CEO
              Jeffrey Skilling.  And in the spirit of full disclosure, I
              have some shares of Enron in my IRA.

              Mr. Skilling, how does revenue go up so much and the
              bottom line doesn't benefit more?

              Jeffrey Skilling (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
              Enron):  Well we had a net income increase, Mark, of over
              forty percent and earnings per share up thirty-two
              percent, so I think it was a real good quarter.

              Haines:  Yeah, but that doesn't answer the question, well,
              how can revenue grow like a hundred and fifty and--and the
              bottom line only benefits forty--forty percent?

              Skilling:  What--what drives our net income, Mark, is the
              increase in physical volumes delivered.  Revenues are
              impacted by price levels and price levels really don't
              impact us because we don't own generation facilities, we
              don't own gas production assets.  So prices move up, prices
              move down, that impacts our revenue.  But what really
              matters to us is how much volume are we delivering to
              customers and our volumes this quarter up fifty-eight
              percent, which drove that increase in our wholesale income.

              Haines:  How unusual should we consider the--the last few
              quarters?

              Skilling:  I think the most lasting legacy of the problems
              in California may be an order that came out of the Federal
              Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday.  And what they did
              is they forced open--moved to four mandatory, what they
              call regional transmission organizations.  (Graphic:  Enron
              (ENE) 8-Quarter Earnings History Chart)  This will make the
              marketplace for electricity in North America open.  And
              what that means is there is a tremendous additional amount
              of growth, we believe, in the electricity markets in North
              America as these markets open up for competition.
              Similarly Europe--Europe is really just starting.  I don't
              know if you saw our numbers in Europe, but our gas volumes
              were up over a hundred percent.  Our electricity volumes
              were up over four hundred percent in Europe.  That market's
              just starting to open and has tremendous future
              opportunities in it.  (Graphic:  One of the world's leading

              Joe Rivkin (Citigroup Investments):  Mr. Skilling, I--you
              are building a global fiber-optic network, which is in
              effect owning some capacity that you're going to be selling
              or trading.  Can you help us understand the logic behind
              that?  And, also, what will make that network different
              from several of the other networks that are out there or
              under construction?  (Graphic:  Has developed an
              intelligent network platform to facilitate online business;
              Divides its business into four core areas:  Wholesale,
              Broadband, Energy and Transportation Services)

              Skilling:  Yeah.  Thanks, Jack.  It's--it's a very, very
              different network than what you'll see anywhere else in the
              world.  If you look at most networks, the capacity to input
              data and the capacity to output data is very similar to
              what the long-haul capacity is.  In our network it's very
              different, the capacity input and output is enormous
              relative to the amount of long-haul capacity we have.  That
              allows us to bring data into our system, move it on to
              other people's systems by creating a marketplace for
              bandwidth, to get customers lower prices.  We think this is
              the future, particularly given the melt down in client and
              prices for bandwidth around the world.  We think this is
              exactly the right strategy to have.  We're focussing on
              those areas where we--we believe that marketplace will be
              good in the future.  In fact, we announced in the press
              release this morning a contract with Microsoft.  A
              multi-year contract to provide bandwidth services that is
              really geared towards providing instantaneous access to
              bandwidth for customers, which is really a new product
              which we think is going to be very important for the
              future.  (Graphic:  Formed in July 1985 as a result of the

              Haines:  Does this get you into the technology business?
              Because if you're dealing with what's coming into a pipe
              and what has to go out of it, there's--there's a lot of
              effort going into place to either compress the information
              or expand the information or route the information...

              Skilling:  Right.

              Haines:  ...how are you dealing with that?

              Skilling:  Well, really, what we're doing in the
              telecommunications business is identical to what we do in
              the natural gas and electricity business.  They're pipes,
              and the data moves through the pipes.  If they can crush
              more--more data into the same amount of pipes, that's good,
              that opens the market, provides additional capacity.  What
              we do is we purchase and sell that capacity and make it
              available through our switching capabilities to any
              customer that wants to get real time access to bandwidth.

              Haines:  How much of a cloud on the horizon is this
              California energy situation?  The--you are suing the state
              of California, California is asking for documents, you're
              refusing to provide them.  The situation doesn't look too
              pleasant.  (Graphic:  Enron Corp (ENE) 1-Year Stock Chart
              and 3-Year Stock Chart)

              Skilling:  Well, Mark, you know, I think--I think the
              entire California thing I think is past the high water
              mark.  Prices now are moving up in California and economics
              101 demand's going down.  I think we're going to get
              through this summer all right.  As Joe was saying, the
              weather's pretty cool out in California.  I think that's
              going to keep the demand for electricity down.  As prices
              come down in California, I think the whole tone of
              discussion in California will get better.  And as I said,
              this whole thing with the Federal Energy Regulatory
              Commission--they recognize now it's important to open the
              grid, it is critical to create efficient markets for
              electricity.  And the step yesterday, I think, is a
              landmark step in opening that market and I think that's
              going to reduce the problems from California.  (Graphic:

              appreciate your bringing us up to date.

What you`re seeing there is, in spite of the slowdown in the economy in=20
Europe, they`re opening up their markets to competition so the non- regulate=

              Suzy Assaad, anchor:

              There's a lot ahead for you in this next half hour.  We're
              going to talk live with the CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling.
              His broadband division is having some troubles and we're
              going to ask him why he thinks he can turn it around.

                                         * * *

              Assaad:  Enron came out with earnings and they actually
              beat the Street.  The energy and communications company
              earned forty-five cents a share from continuing operations
              and that was three cents better than what the Street was
              expecting.  (Graphic:  Enron (ENE) 2Q, 2001 > Actual EPS
              $0.45 > Estimated EPS $0.42  Earnings Alert) The news sent
              shares of Enron sharply higher in the early part of the
              session.  On the day, though, they have managed to turn a
              little bit to the downside.  (Graphic:  Enron intraday
              stock chart)

              Enron, though, is having problems with its broadband
              division.  The company is projecting lower revenues for
              broadband and it is going to eliminate jobs to lower costs.
              Now can broadband be turned around and if not, what will
              they do about it?  Joining us live from Houston is the CEO
              of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling.  (Graphic:  Enron.  Enron 2Q
              profit rises 40% to $404 million as higher sales of
              electricity more than made up for a loss in its
              telecommunications business)

              Mr. Skilling, thank you for being on the show and let's
              start off with that question.  How do you plan to turn
              broadband around, if--continue to keep it or get rid of it?
              What are your plans for there?

              Jeffrey Skilling (Chief Executive Officer, Enron):  Well we
              believe longer term the broadband business is going to be a
              good business.  It's clear, though--absolutely clear that
              we're going through a meltdown in the business right now.
              And so what we need to do is we just need to get our cost
              structure in line with the current view of what revenues
              can be in that business and that's what we're in the
              process of doing.  (Graphic:  Enron.  Net income at the top
              energy trader rose to $404 million, or $0.45/share from
              $289 million or $0.34/share a year earlier) I think, given
              our strategy--our strategy has not been an asset-heavy
              strategy--we should be able to do this pretty easily and
              pretty quickly.  As you've seen from our numbers that we
              announced today, we have extremely strong growth on the
              energy side of our business, so we'll end up redeploying
              people from the broadband business back into our energy
              business.  So we think we can move pretty quickly on it.
              (Graphic:  Enron.  Houston-based company says it sold
              almost twice as much power in North America and five times
              as much in Europe in the quarter)

              Assaad:  That's--that's quite a drain then.  I mean in a
              year where you're having such great numbers, to have the
              broadband be such a drain on your bottom line.

              Skilling:  Well it's not that big in the grand scheme of
              things.  You know our energy business is a big business,
              it's growing very quickly.  Our revenues in energy this
              quarter were over fifty billion dollars.  So that's really
              the big part of our business and, sure, the
              telecommunications business I think long term is going to
              be an opportunity.  I wish it were an opportunity right now
              but I think what we need to do is just get that burn rate
              down, get it consistent with what the revenue opportunity
              is in the industry.  We'll be a survivor and when this
              business comes back, I think it has all the promise that we
              all know it has, it's just going to be a little delayed
              from what we thought before.

              Assaad:  Could we actually get your outlook, Mr. Skilling,
              on energy prices going forward?

              Skilling:  Sure.  It's--it's--

              Assaad:  Is it a one-way street up?

              Skilling:  I don't think so.  We've been really surprised
              by the decline in demand.  If you look at demand for
              electricity and natural gas in North America, it is way
              down this year, almost unprecedented decline in demand for
              a developed economy.  I've never seen anything like it
              before.  And--and I think it's been triggered by the fact
              that prices went up last year and customers--sort of
              Economics 101--customers have decided that there are
              cheaper alternatives and so the demand has gone down and
              that has really driven down prices.  You know gas prices
              are way off from what they were earlier this year.  Power
              prices all across the country are way down from what they
              were earlier this year.  And so I think it's just natural
              economics taking effect.  But what I think it means is that
              the current price level that we're seeing for gas and
              electricity are probably likely to be the prices that we'll
              see for--for some time now.  They're on the low side of the
              range that everyone was expecting but I think that's what
              it looks like.  (Graphic:  Enron.  President, CEO Jeffrey
              Skilling has predicted that revenue will top $200 billion
              this year)

              Assaad:  In terms of what's going on in California,
              it's--it's said that that has put some pressure on your
              stock price as of late.  What are your predictions down
              that end?

              Skilling:  Well it has put pressure on our stock price.
              You know we've--we've hit earnings or exceed earnings
              expectations every quarter for the last four years and yet
              our stock's down this year.  I think the reason for that is
              that all of this noise from California has obscured the
              performance of the company.  (Graphic:  Enron.  In places
              including CA, Enron has a growing business in contracts
              that manage energy supply for big clients such as
              Owens-Corning, Lilly)

              But I think we're now, because prices are
              dropping--wholesale prices are dropping for power, I really
              think we've seen the high water mark of the problems in
              California.  (Graphic:  Enron.  Contracts increased 89% to
              $7.2 bln in the quarter, Enron says) It's been cool in
              California, prices are down and I think as this works its
              way through the system, I think a lot of the noise and a
              lot of the antagonism will start to go away and I think--in
              fact I think probably the greatest legacy of this whole
              California debacle will be what happened yesterday in the
              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  You know they came
              out with an order that most people weren't really, I don't
              think, looking at that carefully.  But this--this order
              requires the development of a very, very efficient
              marketplace for electricity in North America.  (Graphic:
              Enron.  While California power prices were double year-ago
              levels, Enron reiterated its 2001 profit forecast of
              $1.80/share and said it made no difference to Enron's
              bottom line) It's a huge step forward, it's very, very
              positive.  And so while it's technical in nature, I think
              ultimately it will have probably the most impact going
              forward in time, more than this whole California things has
              had.

              Assaad:  Interesting.  In terms though of--of going forward
              from here, it's also said that a lot of your wholesale
              margins, a lot of certainly your volumes are going to be
              dependent on the development of Europe, that this is really
              the area of growth for you right now.  Do you agree with
              that and where do you see Europe going for you in the next
              year?

              Skilling:  Well, Europe is important and Europe is just
              starting the process of liberalizing markets, the
              continental countries.  And so we think there's enormous
              growth opportunities there.  Gas volumes were up over a
              hundred percent.  Our power volumes were up over four
              hundred percent.  So I think there's great opportunity
              there and that will be a source of growth in the future.
              (Graphic:  Enron.  That's because Enron's risk-management
              business makes money it expects to make $2.15 in 2002;
              First Call estimate for 2002 was $2.12, whether power
              prices rise or fall, analysts say)

              Assaad:  Mr. Skilling, do you think there's greater
              opportunity for Enron in Europe than there currently is
              here in the U.S.?

              Skilling:  No.  And that's--I was about to say that with
              this change in the federal policy, this--currently only
              about twenty percent of the wholesale market for power is
              accessible.  You can only get to about twenty percent of
              the locations in the country because of flawed regulation
              in North America.  If these rules go through, as was
              dictated yesterday by the Federal Energy Regulatory
              Commission, the entire U.S. market opens up and so this is
              an enormous growth opportunity.  And--and because this is
              our biggest business, we think it will have more effect
              than Europe.  (Graphic:  Enron.  Enron's ability to boost
              profit and sales even as its broadband business slumped
              shows it can manage changing market conditions, analysts
              say) But longer term, Europe's a great market, great
              business for us.

              Assaad:  Absolutely.  Thank you very much for joining us
              today.  Jeffrey Skilling, joining us to talk about Enron.

Street expectations, Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Jeff Skilling said=20
Thursday that prospects for his company remain extremely strong.=20
"We are well-positioned for future growth," Skilling told analysts during a=20

Skilling also downplayed ongoing controversy regarding the power crisis in=20

thinks the issue already has reached "a high-water mark" and should subside.=
=20
California likely will make it through the summer without much additional=20
power problems, he said, helped by lower prices and cooler weather.=20
Enron, Houston, reported second-quarter net income Thursday of $404 million,=
=20
40% more than net income of $289 million in the year-go period.=20
The company surpassed Wall Street expectations for the quarter, reporting=20
earnings of 45 cents a share on revenue of $50 billion. Enron had been=20
expected to earn 42 cents a share, according to the consensus of analysts=20
polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
Enron earned 34 cents a share on $16.8 billion in revenue in the year-ago=20
period.=20

CEO Skilling also heralded the decision Wednesday by the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission ordering that four large electric-transmission=20
organizations be formed to optimize the flow of electricity nationwide.=20
The move will lead to a major improvement in business conditions for=20
companies such as Enron, he said, because it will create a solid foundation=20
for competitive power markets across the country. Enron officials estimated=20
that they'll eventually be able to compete in more than 90% of U.S. power=20
markets because of the commission's order, as opposed to the 20% the company=
=20
forecasts now.=20
Enron is the nation's largest electricity trader and marketer.=20
"This is a major, major step forward," Skilling said. "All the lights are=20
green right now" for Enron's wholesale-services division, which accounted fo=
r=20
about 97% of Enron revenue in the second quarter.=20
Skilling expressed confidence that Enron will meet Wall Street's full-year=20
earnings expectations of $1.80 a share. In addition, he said the company wil=
l=20
earn $2.15 a share in 2002, an increase from current 2002 expectations of=20
$2.12 a share.=20
Still, Enron's otherwise solid second-quarter results were marred by the=20
performance of its broadband-services division, where among other activities=
=20
it has been a pioneer in creating a trading market for broadband, or=20
high-speed Internet capacity. The division lost $102 million in the quarter=20
before interest, minority interests and taxes, compared with an $8 million=20
loss in the year-ago period.=20
Skilling said the division has been the victim of an overall "meltdown" in=20
the broadband industry.=20
"Revenue this quarter, or revenue opportunities, just dried up" in broadband=
,=20
he said.=20
The business climate eventually will rebound and bear fruit for Enron,=20
Skilling said, but that is probably one to two years away.=20
In the interim, Enron is planning to overhaul the broadband unit, cutting=20
costs and narrowing its scope to focus strictly on intermediation, or=20
trading, activities and on providing specific bandwidth to large enterprise=20
customers. Enron didn't reveal details of the planned cuts Thursday.=20
Still, Skilling did note that he thinks investors already have penalized=20
Enron for the broadband unit, or at best given it no value as reflected in=20
the stock price. He said he thinks that reaction is unwarranted and=20
understates the future potential of the broadband unit.=20

Later, in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Chief Executive Skilling=20
reiterated that California's ongoing efforts to resolve its power crisis wil=
l=20
have no negative impact on Enron.=20
He also dismissed as "all politics" a move Wednesday by a California Senate=20
committee to forward a contempt charge against Enron to the full California=20

of an investigation into wholesale power prices in the state.=20
"They have no jurisdiction, and they've made it clear they won't keep=20

Enron shares recently traded at $48.80, down 30 cents, despite the company's=

y=20
companies straight off of a Monopoly board.=20
No longer. Deregulation has unleashed competition, and headlines from the=20
California power crisis have sent entrepreneurs and investors scurrying into=
=20
the energy sector.
While old economy energy companies have attracted much of the attention,=20
there's growing interest in smaller companies that comprise an emerging=20

microturbines to Internet tools that manage, monitor and even trade=20
electricity.=20
A recent energy industry venture capital fair, which organizers said was the=

first of its kind, drew 75 start-up companies to Boston - an event many=20
investors who attended said would have been unimaginable even a few years=20

The companies and VCs are after the "$300 billion jump ball" made possible b=
y=20
electricity deregulation, said Todd Klein, managing director of Kinetic=20
Ventures, a Chevy Chase, Md.-based VC firm.=20
Their monopolies gone, power companies are being forced like never before to=
=20
improve productivity. Start-ups are trying to help them with a new generatio=
n=20
of high-tech gadgets.=20
Meanwhile, technology companies are demanding cheaper and more reliable powe=
r=20
sources. Entrepreneurial talent also is drifting to energy. And finally,=20
several technologies developed in government labs have recently become=20
commercially viable.=20
"We have been following these technologies 10 years, and they never were=20
anything more than science experiments," said Jeff Miller of Boston's Beacon=
=20
Group, which manages $1.6 billion in two energy VC funds. "Now you've got th=
e=20
demand coming from the marketplace and very serious managers with very=20
focused business plans."=20
Offsetting the flurry of enthusiasm is tighter funding from the VCs.=20
According to research firm Venture Economics, 77 companies took in more than=
=20
$1.2 billion in funding in the sector last year, but so far this year just 1=
7=20
companies have raised a total of $132 million. That pales in comparison to=20
the old economy energy companies, which have raised $7 billion in IPOs this=20
year.=20
David Lincoln, founder of EnerTech Capital in Wayne, Pa., told entrepreneurs=
=20
at the conference that nobody is in a hurry to make deals, and the condition=
s=20
that VCs impose now "were virtually unheard of 18 months ago."=20
Still, new public energy companies accounted for a third of all IPOs in the=20
first six months of the year. And the power crisis has caused the entire=20
investment community to take notice.=20
"Three or four years ago, when we were looking at certain deals, we'd go to=20
the banks and we'd never know who to talk to," Lincoln said. "Do you talk to=
=20
the utility bankers, or the technology bankers?"=20
Now, every major investment bank has begun tracking a sector.=20
"Everybody's backing out of the dot-coms and telecoms," said Bradley Johnson=
,=20
president of Washington, D.C.-based Pepco Technologies, which was seeking=20
funding here. "They're saying the next new thing is energy, but they haven't=
=20
figured it out yet. The management groups at these energy funds are sitting=20
back, figuring out where they want to be."=20
They are chasing some of the relative success stories like Chatsworth,=20
Calif.-based Capstone, which makes freestanding microturbines that allow=20
businesses to produce their own electricity. Company shares have traded as=20
high as $100, but have fallen under $20, and the company still hasn't turned=
=20
a profit.=20
The sector "still hasn't seen its Netscape," Klein said.=20
The upshot - and the lesson from last month's venture capital fair - is that=
=20
the next little thing is on the minds of VCs as much as the next big one.=20
That means technologies that don't necessarily revolutionize how electricity=
=20
is produced so much as help traditional companies produce it, and customers=20
use it, even just a little bit more efficiently.=20
"I think with the events which occurred in California and which are=20
threatening to occur in other parts of the company, people are focused on=20
immediate solutions to those problems," Klein said.=20
Many companies touting those types of solutions were at the fair, such as=20
Encinitas, Calif.-based PredictPower, which builds systems to help companies=
=20
manage their electrical use. Others showed flywheels, which store electricit=
y=20
on site to guarantee a perfectly steady stream of power for sensitive=20
equipment. And some are still fighting to break into the already crowded=20
online electricity exchange market.=20
Other companies target the power companies themselves, with everything from=20

"There's just a lot more focussing on taking away the antiquities inherent i=
n=20
the old utilities system," said David Smith, who follows the sector for=20
Solomon Smith Barney.=20
Especially at the venture capital level, where backers tend to be looking fo=
r=20
smaller investments and quicker returns. That's meant short shrift for some=20
early-stage "green" companies.=20
"Everybody's supply side," lamented R.W. Cushing, an entrepreneur whose=20

A Volt From Blue, U.S. Grid Rules Get Power Co's Abuzz
By Arden Dale

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Energy companies, beware. This could mean you win, an=
d=20
it could mean you lose. Not today, not next week, but down the road.=20
Big changes in the way power companies control the U.S. electricity grid are=
=20
looming because of orders announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission on Wednesday. At stake are billions of dollars companies could=20
make buying and selling electricity.
Power companies across the U.S. scrambled Thursday to learn details of the=20
orders, which haven't actually been issued yet. They will probably be=20
available by Friday, FERC spokespeople said.=20
Companies that may benefit most, including Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy Inc.=20
(DYN), Duke Energy Corp.(DUK) and Williams Co. (WMB), market electricity but=
=20
don't own power lines. Big transmission-owners such as Southern Co. (SO),=20
American Electric Power Co. (AEP) and Entergy Corp. (ETR), stand to lose=20
control over their assets, according to analysts.=20
"This is a major, major step forward," Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey=
=20
Skilling said of the FERC orders in a conference call on the company's=20
earnings Thursday.=20
On Wednesday, the FERC said it would direct transmission owners to form huge=
=20
regional power grid operators by merging groups that already operate in the=20
Northeast and Southeast. It said it would assign judges to start mediating=20
right away with companies over a 45-day period to work toward compliance.=20
The new grid operating giants must be up and running by December 2001,=20
according to FERC spokesperson Celeste Miller. The FERC is widely expected t=
o=20
issue similar orders for the West and Midwest.=20
The move this week accelerates a push the FERC's been making for several=20
years to form regional transmission operators, or RTOs. In 1999, the agency=20
issued a rule known as Order 2000 that directed companies to come up with=20
plans to form RTOs. Many utilities missed deadlines to file plans, and=20
companies including Enron criticized the FERC for not giving stronger=20
directives and setting more aggressive deadlines.=20
California's energy crisis has also prompted harsh criticism of the FERC, an=
d=20
may have helped push the agency to take stronger actions, according to some=20
observers.=20
Energy companies and Wall Street analysts said the action this week took the=
m=20
by surprise, more because of how fast the agency wants change to occur than=20
because of what it wants done. Some said they doubt change will happen that=20
fast.=20
"It's a departure from the slower transition to the new market, which has=20
been supported by companies like American Electric Power Co. and Southern=20
Co.," said Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets L.P.=20
(SCH) "That doesn't mean necessarily that the older companies won't survive,=
=20
but clearly FERC is moving to catch up to the trailblazers in the industry."=
=20
Utilities and other power companies have already formed a number of grid=20
operating organizations. Three are up and running in the East, including one=
=20
in the New England, one in New York and another in the Mid-Atlantic region.=20
Those groups will be joined under one of the new orders.=20
The orders are intended, in part, to address complaints by some companies=20
that they can't move power freely around the grid to maximize their profits.=
=20
They say utilities sometimes manipulate markets unfairly by claiming lines=20
are congested and denying others access.=20
"Clearly, there is a benefit for the marketplace," said David Clement,=20
associate director at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "It simply=20
makes it easier for wholesale power marketers to do business."=20
Enron expects the orders will open up U.S. wholesale markets dramatically,=20
according to spokesman Mark Palmer. Right now, the market is about 20% open=20
to competitors: after companies comply with the order, it will be more like=20
90% open, Palmer said.=20
The FERC's orders this week didn't have an impact on energy company stocks.=20
That's partly because changes won't occur immediately, and because=20
transmission assets aren't huge profit centers for companies, according to=20
Steve Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER).=20
Transmission lines do offer their owners benefits, however. "They're not as=20
sexy as growth businesses, but they're great cash generators," said Uspenski=

The FERC's orders will help to stimulate sorely needed investment in power=20

FERC Power Grid Orders Will Open Markets for Traders (Update2)

FERC Power Grid Orders Will Open Markets for Traders (Update2)

     (Adds comment from utility consultant in fourth paragraph.)

     Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's decision to restructure the U.S.
electricity grid opens the country's power markets to further
competition, analysts said, even as California struggles with the
aftermath of its deregulation.
     ``The only reason for doing this is so you can have
competition,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams
Capital Group LP. ``It's so you can build a transmission system
that lets generators deliver power across utility boundaries
without interference by the utilities themselves.''
     The FERC wants four regional transmission organizations in
the U.S. -- one for the Southeast, one for the Northeast, one for
the Midwest and one for the West -- that would allow more trading
among regions. Florida has the option not to join, and Texas is
exempt from FERC jurisdiction.
     ``The FERC had given some hints,'' said Larry Winter, a
partner at Accenture Ltd. who has consulted with utilities forming
transmission organizations. ``Now they are telling the utilities,
at least in the Northeast and Southeast, exactly what they want.''
     Energy traders such as Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Aquila
Inc. stand to benefit as barriers to electricity transmission
fall, Enron officials said.
     ``We'll have the chance to match hundreds of potential supply
sources with thousands of markets,'' Enron Executive Vice
President Steve Kean said on a conference call with analysts and
investors. ``It's a significant expansion of the market in a very
short time.''

                         California Crisis

     California's two biggest utilities have racked up about
$14 billion in debt because power prices surged after the state
deregulated its market, and the utilities weren't allowed to pass
higher prices on to customers. The state began buying power on the
utilities' behalf in January. A power shortage led to blackouts
for millions of Californians this year.
     Politics and different market rules are the major obstacles
to consolidating the transmission organizations that utilities
proposed, Winter said.
     The commission wants the transmission systems of New England,
New York and the mid-Atlantic states to combine.
     ``New York is not on the same page'' as New England's grid
operator, which based its rules on those of PJM Interconnection
LLC, the grid manager for Pennsylvania, Delaware, and eastern
Maryland and New Jersey, Winter said.
     Enron shares rose 45 cents $49.55. They have fallen 31
percent in the past year. Aquila fell 45 cents to $25.55. Mirant
fell $1.20 cents to $36.58.




Enron CEO Skilling on California Crisis, FERC Talks: Comment
2001-07-12 15:12 (New York)


     Houston, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling comments on the company's ongoing dispute with
the state of California about power sales and the settlement talks
on the issue being led by an administrative law judge at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
     Skilling's remarks were made in a telephone interview
following the release of Enron's second-quarter earnings.
     Houston-based Enron's shares have fallen 41 percent this
year.

On the settlement talks:

     ``It's pretty clear that the state has no particular interest
in resolving this. It makes for good political fodder, and so I
think they'll spend a lot of time making a lot of noise about it,
and basically nothing will happen until the judge comes in, and
the judge will set some kind of conclusion.''

     Skilling said the $8.9 billion in refunds California has
requested from power generators and sellers ``has no relevance to
any true or valid claim the state of California has.
     ``They want their $8.9 billion, and then they say they'll
continue to sue after the fact. That's not the basis of a
settlement.''

On the outlook for the California power crisis:

     ``If you look at the impetus for this whole thing, it was
very, very high prices in the wholesale market. Those prices have
abated now. They're down significantly, and I think that's going
to reduce the noise level in California.''

On Enron's links to the Republican Party and its relationship with
California:

     ``I think our connection and (Enron Chairman) Ken Lay's
connection with the Republican Party has sort of set us up to be
their target, but the reality is our business is based on a lot of
things, and California is just one of them.''

     Enron and its employees gave $113,800 to President George W.
Bush's election campaign, making them jointly Bush's 12th-largest
contributor, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
which tracks campaign finance. Lay gave the $2,000 maximum for an
individual.
     Lay also gave more than $325,000 in unlimited and largely
unregulated ``soft money'' to Republican committees that helped
finance Bush's campaign. That was part of at least $1.6 million
contributed during the election by Enron and its officers, two-
thirds of which went to Republicans, according to FECInfo, which
also tracks campaign finance.
     California Governor Gray Davis is a Democrat, and both houses
of the state legislature are controlled by Democrats.




Enron Chief Executive Sees California's Energy Crisis Easing

Enron Chief Executive Sees California's Energy Crisis Easing

     Houston, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling said higher retail prices for electricity in
California has curtailed power demand and should lead to fewer
blackouts than expected this summer.
     ``The expectation of higher retail prices has dampened demand
considerably,'' Skilling said in a conference call with analysts
and investors. ``I think we're going to get through the summer
just fine in California. That will ultimately lead to lower
wholesale prices for power.''
     The state had been facing about 15 hours of blackouts a week
this summer, the North American Electric Reliability Council, a
national group that monitors and coordinates U.S. power supplies,
said in May. California has been spared outages recently because
of conservation efforts, cooler temperatures and more power plants
starting.
     California Governor Gray Davis said that power plants
producing enough energy for about 1.2 million homes have opened
this summer in California.
     ``We're not out of the woods yet, but we are making
progress,'' Davis said in a statement yesterday.
     California is seeking $8.9 billion in refunds from generators
such as Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, for power
bought in the last year. Under the formula used by California to
derive that figure, Enron is actually owed $44 million because it
bought more power than it sold since May 2000, Skilling said.
     Shares of Enron fell 20 cents to $48.90 in early afternoon
trading. The company said earlier today second-quarter profit rose
40 percent as higher sales of electricity more than made up for a
loss in its telecommunications business.

California Not Due Cash Refunds for Power Purchases (Update1)

California Not Due Cash Refunds for Power Purchases (Update1)

     (Adds comment from judge's recommendation in third paragraph,
background in fourth.)

     Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- California should not
receive any cash refund for claims it was overcharged for
electricity, a federal judge overseeing settlement talks said in a
report to federal regulators.
     California's debts to power sellers for electricity they sold
in the state is higher than any refund the state can claim,
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner wrote in a report to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
     ``While there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are
even larger amounts owed to energy sellers'' by California and its
utilities, Wagner wrote in his report. He said California is owed
``hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion
dollars.''
     FERC ordered Wagner to hold settlement talks on California's
claim it was overcharged by $8.9 billion for electricity. The
sides failed to reach an agreement and FERC ordered the judge to
make a recommendation to the commission. FERC plans to decide on
the size of any refunds.
