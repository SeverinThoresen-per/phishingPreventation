Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be o=
n January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the=
 application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression that =
yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful sug=
gestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition for=
ward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.  Y=
ou could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new spac=
e for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing play=
 room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bordered b=
y the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built=
 in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to add a s=
econd staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom shou=
ld be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof until you we=
re within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facing the back =
of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway the addition=
 would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forwa=
rd with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitchen and dining r=
oom windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded. =
 That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing.  Your =
ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would s=
till be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the =
better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in expl=
oring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest something=
 in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try an=
d sketch out these ideas.

Phillip
