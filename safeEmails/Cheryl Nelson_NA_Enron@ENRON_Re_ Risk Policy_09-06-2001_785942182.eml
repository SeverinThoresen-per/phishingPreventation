I can attend the meeting since this will be the third in a series of recent =
ones I have attended in an ongoing discussion.  I do not want to meet on Mon=
day however.  On Monday, I will talk to Mary to make sure that if there is a=
nything that she or I was to do as follow-up from the last meeting, then it =
has been done.  Also, if we are all going to attend, then it makes sense for=
 us to have our group meeting first.

Richard Lauer and Mary Nordstrom would like to meet on Monday (or sometime n=

py to meet with them, but don't know how much input I will be able to give t=
hem.  Sara, maybe you have some info that I can pass along?

Let me know if you would like to meet with them and, if so, what times you a=
re available.  Or let me know if there is some info I should give to them.

Thanks,
Stephanie
