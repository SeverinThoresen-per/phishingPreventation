How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mone=
y, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most=
 important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is beari=
sh, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the=
 international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no w=
ay resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil comp=
anies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with moderni=
ty. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown;=
 Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They ar=
e young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of =
the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic but=
ton-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intentl=
y, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV sc=
reen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while=
 another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people enterin=
g from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jau=
nty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks=
 concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multico=
lored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on it=
s diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks dec=
lares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's Leading Energy Com=
pany to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from=
 a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. =
It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percen=
t in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion=
 to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles through=
out the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy," notes=
 a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market in=
telligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined=
 to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by =
then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old for=
mula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then sell=
ing it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company=
 that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to el=
ectricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron wo=
uld fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's =
energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a=
 Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power need=
s, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and pot=
entially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with=
 each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company wo=
uld be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in Fe=
bruary of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chi=
ef executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great marriage of the ris=
k-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the fi=
nancial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end=
 of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron w=
as going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American =
economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a cult=
ure that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the be=
st versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who coul=
d see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the ri=
ght kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company=
 couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $=
80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energ=
y crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for hi=
s relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project=
 in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in =
which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once to=
uted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in =
Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain tim=
es that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the com=
pany created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about bu=
siness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone-i=
t was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the c=
olor scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once=
 headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany fl=
oors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off t=
he jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black va=
se on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. The=
re is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is n=
o longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six mont=
hs as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electri=
c's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anoint=
ed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained advent=
ure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone could actually ge=
t killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning.=
 "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all the personal sacri=
fices he made while retooling Enron.=20
=46rom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and whit=
e photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorce=
d, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher=
=2E He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I n=
ever learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his younge=
st son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-=
minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get anyth=
ing out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on hi=
s list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure that =
fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally. Then =
his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragma=
tic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that would not ha=
ve been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hands=
ome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assidu=
ously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious un=
derlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at repor=
ters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are bitte=
rly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of=
 his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. =
"I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understanding th=
is."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nin=
eties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfold=
ing throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to f=
ive and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine =
silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked n=
ear the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurri=
ed and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days=
 (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene=
: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Housto=
n, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energ=
y world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humilia=
tion?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eightie=
s when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas=
 turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequentl=
y enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volat=
ile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal d=
eregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas =
pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from C=
oastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then r=
un by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief o=
perating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thes=
is at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.=
) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas=
 brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipeline=
s stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attem=
pts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pi=
peline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in t=
he country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in =
a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coast=
al. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being called "th=
e merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brut=
al politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity st=
arted shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a n=
ew company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vi=
sion of the future," says one person associated with Enron at that time. "He=
 never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive =
debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had ex=
clusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new=
 business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got start=
ed.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had=
 spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had=
 been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illi=
nois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I liked=
 being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told BusinessWeek=
 earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't=
 deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anx=
ious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he w=
ould come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and he loved=
 being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist Univ=
ersity, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvar=
d Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. The=
n Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to Am=
erican success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business con=
sultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless,=
 and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above a=
ll an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worryin=
g about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone =
saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where =
credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he calle=
d the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price=
 of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker=
 but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk invo=
lved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment ba=
nk would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." Then=
 the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron execut=
ives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says, "=
they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejecte=
d, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then sa=
id, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a =
cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens=
 of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those =
divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would be =
different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even =
if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the =
company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's charact=
er, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke ar=
ound Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in." And he=
 was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the =
head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1=
991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that=
, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had=
 a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that wou=
ld make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas=
, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate =
it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best a=
ccess to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be =
part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better p=
redict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trad=
es for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of g=
as would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startli=
ng accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever i=
magined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had ma=
de: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busines=
s. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a skil=
l set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most we=
re deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of the=
m men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an indus=
try regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder p=
eople for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lo=
ts of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to create a=
 niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The people who ha=
d narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views =
about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the sm=
artest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And beca=
use his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wan=
ted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest=
 and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston=
=2E In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "aggre=
ssive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were t=
hirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston he=
adquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-=
the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one da=
y. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving abili=
ty, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense of ur=
gency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candid=
ates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the type=
s that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron wo=
uld come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wa=
sn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enoug=
h for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being re=
novated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. S=
uburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-an=
d-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structu=
ring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the glob=
e. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company=
 concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with=
: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the hous=
e, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron neve=
r got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use t=
he company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight =
or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massage=
s were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night=
=2E "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with the compa=
ny health care program at the time. "They really thought about the psycholog=
y and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts,=
 associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those =
titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and =
decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-w=
ith no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make=
 a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until re=
signing recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. =
Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two=
 or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the=
 more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him gla=
cier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road moto=
rcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Me=
xican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say," one l=
oyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas me=
rchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buz=
zword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed=
 the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Fir=
mly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service a=
t lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barn=
storming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company pres=
idents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service ar=
eas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewha=
t more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay ma=
de him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, th=
e division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations larges=
t wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division ha=
d grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 bil=
lion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in th=
e industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New York Ti=
mes noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had =
totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming =
another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within," =
sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilities =
and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed Fortun=
e in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, a=
nd Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up =
30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover =
a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and=
 even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client.=
 People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against=
 the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech co=
mmunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline beca=
me another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades onli=
ne in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid pr=
ice and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, t=
rading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lane=
s on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the =
capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the in=
dustry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal wit=
h Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their =
homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strategy of buil=
ding businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can h=
elp it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: t=
he company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of cus=
tomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle custome=
rs to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to co=
me to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients =
as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were ma=
ximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became o=
vertaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture q=
uickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-yo=
u got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwr=
ite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets an=
d subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from =
the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all=
=2E=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-market=
 accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The com=
pany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's id=
ea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get de=
als. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuiti=
es over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However m=
any millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went o=
n the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be so=
mething fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," investors didn=
't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctua=
ted and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had =
been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be =
high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," says one form=
er employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even=
 extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Housto=
n READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it =
was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy cha=
rity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was sup=
posed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created t=
ook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enro=
n family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change start=
ed at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of t=
he recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the co=
mmodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overheari=
ng orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an intellige=
nt slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang t=
o you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A R=
andom Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disrupti=
ve. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension.=
 The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Ski=
lling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking syst=
em in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those=
 with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly=
 became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division r=
eplaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate pu=
t it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."=
 Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attit=
ude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude towa=
rd the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the=
 way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up=
 to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might hel=
p-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative =
project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: "=
They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sig=
ht of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals=
 within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups w=
ho had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as =
new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became an Enro=
n clich=E9. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says one =
former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restri=
ctive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E=
-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one f=
or the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but =
they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way=
: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you ble=
ed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy c=
ompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Jus=
t as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its =
remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt w=
ith tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt =
with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's p=
ride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects =
had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous retu=
rns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the time for lon=
g-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. "It was t=
he technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebec=
ca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many year=
s the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nick=
name was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the re=
quisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron I=
nternational, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 bi=
llion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron=
's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron =
executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appea=
rances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate Ameri=
ca.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India=
, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way=
: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 perc=
ent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three chang=
es in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other En=
ron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and =
Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, division=
s were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing =
lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentle=
ss people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a =
director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deal=
s, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficu=
lt executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart=
 as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible=
 businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So =
Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own =
company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent=
 more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that co=
uld serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. M=
ark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water compa=
ny. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: =
Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a b=
usiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like=
 gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it=
 up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and co=
nfidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out a=
t $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much dimin=
ished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh=
," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as o=
ne critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old culture t=
han running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay =
announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is when=
 the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely we=
ll now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-p=
ower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle=
=2E Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying th=
e company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay=
 and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W=
=2E Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food=
 or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent ant=
hems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the=
 company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California=
, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried t=
o persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregula=
tion. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pou=
nding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses.=
 By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The I=
ndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of co=
nstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situatio=
n was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that t=
he state had never built enough power plants to service its population and n=
ever properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a very =
good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate co=
mmunications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House=
=2E California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest co=
ntributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of o=
ur stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (California utiliti=
es still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panick=
y.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too appar=
ent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing=
 California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down with its ligh=
ts on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had b=
een responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors b=
elieved that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it=
 had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buy=
ing and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in=
 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the=
 much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in it=
s confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Li=
ke the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron su=
ddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, th=
e stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. Dur=
ing the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challen=
ged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported heft=
y second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had=
 come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ig=
noring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised,=
 as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "There wasn=
't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. "Basi=
cally, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked=
 in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforwar=
d question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing in =
of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed i=
n the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay an=
d Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal re=
ported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the =
company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failur=
es.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock p=
rice: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unfo=
rgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Street is in lo=
ve with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting," says Carol=
 Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weig=
ht."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started ex=
periencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as th=
e most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secret=
aries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their =
ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says. "If =
senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There wa=
s a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it =
now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship =
duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as on=
e Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with so=
meone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation th=
at's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stoc=
k price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness a=
nd frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees =
killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, E=
nron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new=
 president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and =
promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everyth=
ing was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovate much c=
loser to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performance Review =
Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize peo=
ple into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale proble=
m."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news =
of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to t=
heir lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with =
Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed =
in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when th=
e company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detractors =
wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he sa=
ys with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my inter=
ests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himse=
lf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new techno=
logies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone dot-=
coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wa=
ve that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the world'=
s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, h=
e is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. "=
There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get=
 it."
