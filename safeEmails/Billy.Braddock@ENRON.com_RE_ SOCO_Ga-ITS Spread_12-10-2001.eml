Spoke to Lew at Morgan.  In summary, he's $1@$4 for this spread. =20

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the=
 underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liqui=
d markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few ma=
rkets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as oppo=
sed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My r=
esponse was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with hig=
h liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market,=
 we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spr=
ead, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may b=
e players).
