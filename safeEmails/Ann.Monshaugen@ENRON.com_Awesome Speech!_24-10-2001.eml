Ken,

Thanks for putting the issues in perspective for all of us - i.e., it is not=
 the lack of adversity, but rather one's response to adversity, that makes o=
ne great and builds one's character.  From what you said, it sounds like Enr=
on has faced (with integrity) some serious adversity in the past and rallied=
 admirably - certainly no reason to think the same will not happen this toug=
h time.  Keep steering the boat - we'll all get through this!! =20

Thanks and God Bless You!
