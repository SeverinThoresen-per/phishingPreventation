It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is=20
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there=20
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning=20
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this=20
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion=20
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.
