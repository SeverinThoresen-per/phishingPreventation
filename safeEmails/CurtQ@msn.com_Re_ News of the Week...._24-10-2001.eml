OK Zuc - you had to drag up one of indiscretions that landed us in jail, now=
 you have to bring up our altercation in Tiger Stadium that got us thrown ou=
t?  If I remember correctly, we seemed not to be good influences on each oth=
er.  My fondest memory of our jailtime was the guy who stood above us as we =
slept on the floor and he was peeing and farting for about 10 minutes straig=
ht - or maybe it was the guy the next morning to whom you were handcuffed as=
 we were led into court who decided he needed to get himself off while we we=
re waiting in the holding cell.  I don't know why you were so wigged out abo=
ut it.  At least he didn't throw up on you in court. =20

I wonder how much the 'Stately Oak' grew during the past year? Oops! My bad!
I almost forgot that it was mysteriously cut down during an early '80's FIJI
Island pre-decorating/design phase. Has anyone ever fessed up to the
slaying? It sure did cause a terrible stir! If I remember correctly, the
cabinet considered canceling the Island unless the culprit confessed! This
may be a good topic of discussion? Maybe we could solve the mystery once and
for all?
And Bone, the arrest was a major event for at least three of us, me, Curt
and Tan Dan who came to court the next morning to bail us out! If that
arrest didn't make it, maybe the one when I got arrested for disturbing the
peace in Tiger Stadium during the '81 homecoming game against Fla. St. did?
At least the cops didn't beat me as bad as FSU beat the football team that
night! Or maybe Dan's 1st DWI made it? I'll let Dan tell that story.
Hope all you guys are doing well!

Brothers,   (Oct. 16)
Last night I received orders to report for duty this Thursday for up to 24
months.  As some of you may know, I command a Army Reserve unit in Dallas
TX.   I had just moved to Chicago two weeks ago to take a position within my
company, so this is inconvenient and with a very large pay cut, but I add, I
am very proud to be leading 90 of our finest soldiers into whatever mission
is delivered to us.  Due to operational Security(OPSEC), I can't talk much
about what I do, just keep me and my soldiers in your thoughts, and I will
join you at Pig Dinner 2003 or 2004.

Speaking of Brother Bonin, I'll recount a story during our Hellweek that all
can probably relate to.  Brother Bonin was the assistant Pledge Trainer for
our class in 77-78. Our Hellweek coincided with JamJam and, as slave labor,
we were unloading a truck of tables/chairs at a sorority house. One of the
sorority girls told Brother Bonin that the "pledges" could put the tables in
a certain spot. He corrected the girl by saying they aren't pledges.  When
the girl left, I asked Brother Bonin that if we aren't actives and we aren't
pledges, what are we?  Brother Bonin looked me in the eye and said, "You're
SCUM!"

Lots of news the past couple of weeks.  First, Godspeed to Brother Jeff
Farris.  I know we all wish him a very safe tour.  Second, congrats to the
"Outlaw" for his new baby boy.
Sounds like a lot of people will be in town for Ole Miss--Squid, Tan Dan
(The Worstells) and others.  Let me know who all is coming and maybe we can
all meet some place before or after the game.
Thanks to the 60 Brothers who have signed up for the Yahoo Group.  All the
past History that Brothers Slay & Bonin is helping us relive is posted
there.
