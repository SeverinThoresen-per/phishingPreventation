Rick:

Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000=20
regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.

Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and=
=20
commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference=20
between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus=20
compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and=20
commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay=20
and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or tak=
e=20
a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.

Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the=20
compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly meri=
t=20
increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.

Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to=20
compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two=20
separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Nee=
d=20
someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.

Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale. =20
Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career=20
development of analysts. =20

Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough=20
events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.

Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to=
=20
confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's=20
calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not=20
minimized.

Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the=20
Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one=
=20
pool

Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed=20
together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will=
=20
put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.

 Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts
