	Shelley, the DCC (downstream capacity constraint) code was to acknowledge t=
hat the downstream is the=20
	constraint vs our pipeline being the constraint.  We are working with Tammy=
 and Donna to come up with existing codes to
	use for Needles and Nigas.  Thanks. Lynn

The new cut code went into production on the evening of the 17th of July, al=
ong with the rest of the migration. The reason being, is that it was already=
 written=20
into the script and tested. When we found out that there were issue surround=
ing the new code, it was to late to take out of the script and re-test. So i=
n the
mean time, I have sent a memo to the teams informing them not to use the new=
 code. The new code will not be pulled out of the system until the next migr=
ation, which is slated for September 1st time frame. If you have any questio=
ns, please ask me. Thank you.
