Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).  If you view the=20
meter in MOPS you can see the deal.  (It had zero volume before today.)

Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put=

in.

Daren,

I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters:

98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was=20
on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new=
=20
deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.

98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new dea=
l=20
referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly=20
and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied.

Thanks
-Jackie-
