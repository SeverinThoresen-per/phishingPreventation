 This is a file I have had set up for some years.  From time to time, we=20
receive third party subpoenas from the parties.

 I recently received (through Carrin Patman) an informal request from Exxon'=
s=20
counsel in this matter for some old Exxon/Intratex gas supply contracts. =20
Exxon's expert wants to use these contracts as part of his database to show=20
that, contrary to the royalty class's primary theory of recovery, Exxon did=20
adequately market the royalty owners' gas. =20

 Exxon's attorney has already tried to find these old contracts at Exxon, bu=
t=20
there is no cross-reference index available on these old documents.  Exxon=20
will pay for our costs in responding and has no problem with us wanting them=
=20
to be kept confidential.  The parties recently got a trial setting for Augus=
t=20
28 in Winkler County state court (Kermit Texas).  Exxon will file a motion=20
for continuance, but of course can't be sure that it will be granted.
=20
 Parenthetically, plaintiffs are asking for $53 million in actual damages,=20
and up to twenty times that in punitives, plus 40% attorneys' fees.  I do=20
not, however, believe that Intratex or any present or former Enron entity ha=
s=20
any exposure.  This case has been around for five years, and no Enron entity=
=20
has ever been made a party, nor has there been any hint of that.  You should=
=20
also be aware that a subset of the class brought exactly the same case=20
against Exxon about a year ago and the jury poured them out.  That case,=20
Haley v. Exxon, also involved the same plaintiffs' experts.

 I am working with Bonnie to find out who the right business records=20
custodian would be; it may be that V&E actually has all these old documents.=
 =20
Once I find this out, we will coordinate a response.
