I have confirmed after talking with Jeff Hodge that ENA and EES cannot=20
discuss anything regarding the CES retail business.  Both the CA and the=20
Retail Agreement have sections that explicity mention that  ENA has to keep=20
information confidential.   I talked with Jeff Golden, who is working on the=
=20
EES side and mentioned that there can be no discussions between EES and ENA=20
regarding the CES Retail business without first gaining the written consent=20
of Nisource/CEG.

Jeff - If I have misstated anything, please let me know.

Patrick
