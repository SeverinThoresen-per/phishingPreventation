Chris:
I am not a power expert (Sara Shackleton in our group handles the power=20
trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this.  I=20
understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail=20
message about this.  With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would=20
prefer that you use the form that I have attached.  With respect to the=20
proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the "Corrections to Published=20
Prices" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under=
=20
an ISDA would not be the correct reference.  Also,  in the disclaimer at the=
=20
end, please change all references of "Williams" to "ENA."    Please call me=20
if you have any questions.  If this cannot wait for Christian, perhaps Shari=
=20
Stack could look at it.  Let me know what you want to do.
