^Thrilled as I am that Welch Street is all shiny and new, the
City Public Works Department is in a complete state of
emergency, as near as I can tell.  Nothing short of a new
Council, Mayor, and Management are likely to improve
matters.  The current political group seems to spend most of
their energy building new (unmaintainable) public works
monuments (stadiums, trains) or on various "soft" HR issues.
 Meanwhile, our city is crumbling around our ears - what
Scott Long calls "the necrotization of the inner city"!!=20
Let's have someone from P.W. Dept come to the EMCA meeting
each month and lay out their plan for Montrose for us
(water, sewer, streets, etc).  I might even cut class early
to make it.

Love,

Ben
