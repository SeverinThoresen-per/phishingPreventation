Scott,
Nice chating with you yesterday. I am in Chicago today.

It's going to be interesting if we can grow the Ag. Group for Enron on the
Grain/Oilseed side. Think I can bring good value for them from the start,
they want to go global too,

Fyi, the guys that I met where Ted Noble, Darren Maloney and also Elsa

Saludos,

Pablo

PS: Thanks for leting Elsa now my references.
