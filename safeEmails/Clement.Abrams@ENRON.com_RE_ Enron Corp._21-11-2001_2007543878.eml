Clement,

Brent Hendry has been working on an Enron Corp Guaranty, which would guarant=
ee the physical and financial trading obligations of various Enron affiliate=
s with that of various Duke affiliates.

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For =
your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a "redl=
ined" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA=
 has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfac=
ed font.

Please let me know which changes you will or will not approve.

Thank you in advance for your help.
