Hi Everyone!=20
I'm writing to tell you about an adventure I've committed to this fall! I've=
 registered to participate in the Komen Portland Race for the Cure on Septem=
ber 16th. The Race benefits the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susa=
n G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and supports the Komen Foundation's miss=
ion of eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing =
research, education, screening and treatment.
Last year's Portland Race was the most successful ever - more than 40,000 wo=
men, men and children participated and helped raise more than $1.5 million f=
or the fight against breast cancer! And while a number of strides have been =
made in breast cancer research and treatment, the fact remains that approxim=
ately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lif=
etime. And although much less common, men also get breast cancer. That's why=
 I'm racing for a cure.
The Race is especially important to me because my step-mother, Carol Cutsfor=
th, died from complications associated with her breast cancer on January 14t=
h, 2000. I am personally contributing to this cause, because I have seen fir=
st hand how this disease can cause a life time of suffering and sorrow for t=
hose who were close to breast cancer victims, and more than ever I want to h=
elp find a cure and help those who are in the fight for their life.=20
You can join me in my fight against breast cancer without even breaking a sw=
eat!
Would you please consider at least a $5 pledge to support my effort & The Ko=
men Foundation?
My personal goal is to raise $1000.
Donations must be received by October 18th, 2001.
Your contribution is tax-deductible.
The tax number ID of the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Ko=
man Breast Canver Foundation is 93-1068897.
Receipts will be issued for contributions of $100 or more, or upon request.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this opportunity. Please =
contact me if you have any questions, want to learn more about the Komen Por=
tland Race for the Cure, or if you'd like to join us on September 16th!
Thanks again!
Diane Cutsforth=20
