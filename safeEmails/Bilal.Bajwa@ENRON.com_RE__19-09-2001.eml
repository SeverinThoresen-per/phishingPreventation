John-
Thanks for asking- i am glad you try to get more information before forming =
opinions. I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests=
 by Hunter which you might find informative.

The anti-west opinion is definitely a minority opinion. However, as we have =
seen in the past even in U.S minorities like KKK, terrorists, mass murderers=
, religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publici=
ty and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now.  I think the educate=
d population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now =
but they support this move. But you have to understand that most of the big =
cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles. Thats =
why support is a very relative term here.

The general does not have any political mandate- he came into power through =
a military coup. However, the previously democratically elected governments =
were notorious for corruption(including the government of Benazir Bhutto- th=
e first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxfo=
rd). So people by default support any other alternative and military is prob=
ably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption. Most of=
 the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some th=
at gave up extremely lucrative jobs in U.S in order to try to help put the c=
ountry back on track economically.

Let me send you an article from the TIME mag. that kind of explains why the =
President of Pakistan is in a fix.=20
http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,175058,00.html


Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how t=
he President met with all the political and religious parties and explained =
to them why he supports the U.S - In the article the PPP and PML are the two=
 major parties in Pakistan. Just like the Democrats and Republicans here... =
and the Jamati-i-Islami and the other parties are the religous parties.
He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded co=
ncrete actions as a proof of friendship.=20

The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing Amer=
ican troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intellig=
ence reports about Osama bin Laden's movement inside Afghanistan. Otherwise,=
 the president told the politicians, Washington had warned that it would tre=
at Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists.=20

In that case, the president said, no strategic installations would have rema=
ined safe. "I could not take that risk," the source quoted President Musharr=
af as having said. The president said that he could risk his life but he cou=
ld not put the whole country at risk.=20

The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had th=
e technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their ho=
les. This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or =
biological weapons in Afghanistan.=20

Having received these explanations, main stream political parties, including=
 the PPP and the PML (like-minded), backed the president's decision and said=
 the country should rally round the government, the source said.=20

However, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (both Maulana Sami and Mau=
lana Fazl groups) opposed the decision and asked the government to review it=
s policy. They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evi=
dence of Osama's involvement in the Sept 11 attacks on the US soil.=20

Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you t=
oo much....
Bilal

Hey Bilal,

How are you doing?  I just wanted to ask you some questions about Pakistan i=
f you don't mind.  I see some articles about protestors in Pakistan, protest=
ing the US.  I can understand that, however, do you think this is the mijori=
ty opinion of Pakistan people, or are these protests happening in areas that=
 are predominately backing the Taliban.  What do the educated population thi=
nk?  Does the general have any backing from the people themselves? =20

What is your opinion?

I understand that these things are very personal to you.  Please let me know=
 if I am prying.  I just wanted to get someone's opinion that actually knows=
 what is going on and not from the news.

Thanks.

John
