Tanya:
Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed=
=20
to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said=20
today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty=20
forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on th=
e=20
form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I=20
go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of=20
all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are=20
still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.

Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should=
=20
be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day=
=20
to day matters should be handled through the 2 Susan's and Samantha, as Tana=
=20
is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects? =20
Thanks.
Carol
