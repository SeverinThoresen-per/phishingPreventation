Your participation and  expertise in high profile visits makes a valuable co=
ntribution to the Enron experience.  To help you manage your time with these=
 visits and to ensure the experienceENRON process works efficiently, we ask =
that Jennifer Brockwell and myself be your single point of contact for sched=
uling your tours.     Our thorough screening process helps ensures these gue=
sts receive access to the right areas, the right subject matter experts (SME=
's) and the highest quality of service.

If you are contacted from someone other than Jennifer and myself (or the cha=
irman's office) to conduct a tour, we recommend you let the person know you =
are happy to help but experienceENRON manages the tour schedule and refer th=
em to Jennifer Brockwell ext. 57358 or Carrie Robert ext. 33522.  =20

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you
