PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Steve, Karl and Tom

I met with Karl this morning.  My suggestion is that, from this point=20
forward, all communications with the trailer park should be coordinated with=
=20
the legal department and all of our communications internally should be=20
prefaced with "Attorney-Client Privileged Communication".   Any=20
correspondence or information that I request from you or that you send me=20
should be prefaced as "Attorney-Client Privileged".  Karl is to duplicate hi=
s=20
file for me and to document dates on which conversations or meetings have=20
taken place thus far.  I will draft a letter for Steve's signature to be sen=
t=20
to the owners of the trailer park and their attorney demanding that they=20
immediately remove the two trailers that are sitting within 6' and 1' of the=
=20
pipe centerline AND the two trailers that are within 16' of the pipe=20
centerline.  In my opinion, you should strictly construe the terms of the=20
right of way agreement which is of public record that states that the granto=
r=20
shall not permit ANY housing or other structure to be within the right of=20
way.  I also will advise them that the trees in the right of way are going t=
o=20
be removed.  I will endeavor to visit with Bud Wolcott and the Lumberton tea=
m=20
regarding this matter.

I am sending this to you as a "heads up" of possible litigation arising out=20
of our demand for these trailer homes to be moved off of HPL's easement.   =20
We have a 50' recorded easement prohibiting structures from being  on or=20
within the right of way.  The engineer that designed the trailer park wrongl=
y=20
assumed it was only 30' wide.  Four trailers are within the easement.  Large=
=20
pine trees are in the easement area and literally on top of the pipeline. =20
Obviously, it will be HPL's nickel to cut down the trees but I anticipate=20
there may be a dispute as to who pays for the trailers to be moved out of th=
e=20
easement area.  They have retained an attorney; however, he has, thus far,=20
not disputed HPL's right to prohibit structures within 25' of the pipe=20
centerline.  Let me know if you need more details.  I'll keep you advised.

PROTECTED - ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEDGE

Karl will be coming to you to discuss the issues below.  We have several=20
mobile homes that have been positioned and placed within our pipeline=20
easement, one approximating a foot off the pipeline.  There are a couple tha=
t=20
I think we should absolutely mandate to be moved.  For the remainder, I woul=
d=20
like to mandate and require in writing the Park management to notify in=20
writing those that remain encroached on the easement of the inherit dangers=20
of a natural gas pipeline and their proximity to such.  Obviously, I am not=20
trying to create a scare, as a scare is not warranted based on any known=20
facts on this pipeline.  But I would believe that our liability may be=20
expanded if we were not proactive and did not require the Park management to=
=20
notify the clients that are encroaching of the circumstances upon which they=
=20
exist.  Each person would therefore be informed about the circumstances=20
surrounding them and would have made a conscientious decision to remain in=20
spite of such circumstances.  Your thoughts on this please.

 I  don't know what the current status of the Pinewood Manor matter is, but=20
Steve Schneider and I talked about it a little on Friday.  We think that if=20
we are going to allow some minor encroachment (a very few mobile=20
homes/trailers, not too close to the pipeline) onto HPL's 50-foot easement,=20
then at a minimum we should get an encroachment agreement which includes:
acknowledgement that HPL is not responsible for any damages resulting from=20
the encroachments
agreement that Pinewood Manor will be responsible for any incremental costs=20
if the encroachments interfere with our operation, maintenance, etc., and=20
will remove any encroachments as required by HPL in order for HPL to conduct=
=20
its operations as it deems appropriate
a commitment from the owners of Pinewood Manor that they will notify (in a=20
document that HPL will provide) all present and future tenants about the=20
pipeline

Please let us know of any developments regarding this matter.
