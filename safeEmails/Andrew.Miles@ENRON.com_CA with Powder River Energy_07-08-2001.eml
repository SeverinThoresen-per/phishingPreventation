Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River =
Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you ne=
ed that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to pur=
chase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity str=
ictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE t=
o build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is fo=
r 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them im=
mediately. =20

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationsh=
ip, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP),=
 who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem si=
gning a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we pu=
t in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew
