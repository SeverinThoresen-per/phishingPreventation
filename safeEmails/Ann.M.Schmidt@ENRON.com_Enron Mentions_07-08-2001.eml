Water has been called the oil of the 21st century. It is in ever shorter sup=
ply, and its price is rising in thirsty cities and farming regions from the =
Middle East to the American West. And what Kuwait is to oilbal economic summ=
it, when he noted that "water will forever be an issue in the U.S., particul=
arly the Western part," and added, "I look forward to discussing this with P=
rime Minister Jean Chretien."=20
That raised the hackles of Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson, who=
 snapped that the Bush-Chretien discussion will be "brief." The Prime Minist=
er "will tell the President that we have a policy of not exporting water, an=
d that, I guess, will be it." Bush's casual comment, though, lent encouragem=
ent to a handful of Canadian entrepreneurs who for years have been promoting=
 schemes to export their country's plentiful water. "It's going to happen fo=
r sure," says Gerry White, president of McCurdy Enterprises, a real estate a=
nd construction firm in Gander, Newfoundland. "Trying to stop people from se=
lling water is like telling Saudi Arabia not to sell oil."
White is preparing to invest $24 million in a plan to ship 132 million gal. =
of pristine lake water every week via specially lined oil tankers to prospec=
tive buyers (whom he declines to name) in the Southern U.S. and elsewhere. C=
anada's provinces prohibit bulk water shipments, on environmental grounds. S=
till, White's prospects have improved with official hints that Newfoundland'=
s ban might be dropped- -and with court challenges arguing that such bans ar=
e illegal under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Says Bill =
Turner, who runs WaterBank.com, an enterprise based in Albuquerque, N.M., th=
at locates new water supplies for cities and industries around the world: "W=
e're just at the beginning of the boom."=20
Even so, the dreams of an H2O bonanza can be maddeningly elusive. During the=
 past half-century, there have been at least nine proposals for large-scale =
water diversions from Canada and Alaska, including a $100 billion megaprojec=
t to pipe water from James Bay in northern Quebec to the Western U.S. and a =
bizarre scheme for tugboats to tow icebergs to Mexico. Just three months ago=
, a Greek company, Aquarius Water Transportation, was in Houston trying to i=
nterest clients in pumping North American water into rafts the size of footb=
all fields and towing them to parched locales around the world--a method Aqu=
arius uses to haul water around the Aegean.=20
Although bottled water is already a $30 billion global industry, the technol=
ogical challenge of shipping bulk quantities of freshwater between distant p=
oints and distributing it to customers has so far stumped some major would-b=
e players. For example, Azurix, a water- retailing company and a subsidiary =
of the energy multinational Enron, is struggling. "Enron thought it could us=
e its expertise as a commodity trader to market water like energy," says Deb=
ra Coy, a water analyst with Charles Schwab. "But water is more complex poli=
tically."=20
Just ask President Bush. Or the municipal leaders of Webster, N.Y. In March =
the tiny village (pop. 2,500) just south of Lake Ontario placed ads in the W=
all Street Journal and the New York Times offering to sell 2 million gal. a =
day of "crystal clear well water." That bit of enterprise earned an icy repr=
imand from Michigan Governor John Engler, former chairman of the Council of =
Great Lakes Governors, who reminded village officials that the eight Great L=
akes Governors were "required to approve all diversions and exports of water=
" from the U.S. section of the Great Lakes basin. "There are places even in =
New York State that are crazy for water," steamed Mayor William Ruoff, who a=
dded that inquiries had come from as far away as Texas and Switzerland. "Why=
 shouldn't we help them when we have water to spare?" Not to mention village=
 coffers to line. At current bulk- water prices of $2 per 1,000 gal. for shi=
pping within the U.S., Webster stood to earn as much as $2 million a year fr=
om the scheme.=20
Opponents say it's not the profit they object to but the precedent Webster's=
 plan would set. The Great Lakes basin contains 18% of the world's freshwate=
r, though that doesn't necessarily mean there is water to spare. In a 1999 r=
eport, the U.S.-Canada International Joint Commission warned that levels in =
lakes Michigan and Huron had dropped 22 in. from the previous year--"the mos=
t precipitous drop in recorded history," says the IJC's Frank Bevacqua--and =
last year the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted=
 that levels would fall an additional 2 ft. by 2030. A prolonged dry spell h=
as hurt, but water consumption is also rising.=20
Until now, the most effective limits on the water trade have been economic. =
Compared with the costs of shipping freshwater by sea, "it's still cheaper t=
o get freshwater by other means, even by desalinization of seawater," admits=
 Turner of WaterBank.com. But Turner, who is assembling a consortium of Mexi=
can municipalities to import water from the U.S., adds that aging infrastruc=
ture and mounting worries over contaminated groundwater are helping make lar=
ger ventures worthwhile. Schwab's Coy estimates that the world market for pr=
ivate distribution of water, and the bill for wastewater treatment, now amou=
nts to $300 billion annually. The market has already attracted global giants=
 like Monsanto and Vivendi, and more are expected to enter. Johan Bastin of =
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development noted in 1999 that "wat=
er is the last infrastructure frontier for private investors."=20
Experts say public-subsidy schemes often give water to farms and industries =
for as little as $16 an acre-foot when it's worth as much as $400 to municip=
al water systems. That encourages uneconomic uses of the precious resource. =
Water consumption in the U.S. averages 100 gal. a day per person, nearly thr=
ee times the European average. Coy predicts that once private buyers and sel=
lers are allowed to determine a market price for water, international trade =
in the commodity will boom.=20
Gerry White of McCurdy Enterprises is preparing for that day and thinks it's=
 not far off. He's planning to build a five-mile pipeline to carry water fro=
m Gisborne Lake to Newfoundland's southern coast, then pump it into tanker s=
hips. White estimates it will cost less than a penny a gallon to get water f=
rom the lake to his potential buyers. Bulk water now sells for about 2[cents=
] per gal. in the U.S. At 66 million gal. a shipload, twice a week, that's a=
 lot of pennies.=20

Eco-Economists Back Bush on Kyoto Pact --- Obscure Group Says Accord Contain=

NEW YORK -- President Bush has had a hard time convincing skeptical European=
 allies and environmentalists that he was right to withdraw from the Kyoto P=
rotocol, an international agreement on global warming. But one obscure group=
, environmental economists, says that the accord really is seriously flawed,=
 lending some intellectual weight to Mr. Bush's position.=20
Environmental economists, most of whom work in academia, act like corporate =
auditors sizing up a company's expenses. They try to weigh the costs and ben=
efits of new environmental regulations for the global economy, using complex=
 computer models. With papers like "Requiem for Kyoto," these economists hav=
e been picking apart the accord to reduce carbon dioxide and other so-called=
 greenhouse gases ever since it was unveiled in 1997 at a meeting of world d=
iplomats in the Japanese city of Kyoto.
Many of these economists say that if Washington were to join the Kyoto Proto=
col, it would force the U.S. to pay a sudden and hefty price to reduce green=
house gases. Instead, they call for a go-slow approach to fight global warmi=
ng.=20
Mr. Bush declared the Kyoto agreement fatally flawed in March and pulled the=
 U.S. out of it. But 178 nations decided in July to go ahead without the U.S=
=2E in implementing the accord, which calls for industrialized countries to =
cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012.=
 Those nations now must set themselves to the task of implementing the compl=
icated agreement, uncertain about what role, if any, will ultimately be play=
ed by the U.S., the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases.=20
"It may well be unworkable," says William Nordhaus, a Yale University profes=
sor who previously served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors un=
der President Jimmy Carter.=20
Many environmental economists believe that a buildup of gases like carbon di=
oxide and methane in the atmosphere could become a serious problem in the de=
cades to come. But they argue that the U.S. could attack the problem by spen=
ding the next couple of decades developing better technologies for cutting g=
reenhouse-gas emissions.=20
Kyoto sets relatively short-term targets to reduce emissions, for 2008 to 20=
12, which could force coal-fired power plants and inefficient vehicles to be=
 shut down before they reach the end of their useful lives, at a potentially=
 huge cost to the economy, some economists predict.=20
"We might as well do it slowly and let the capital stock turn over during th=
e next 30 years, so we're not throwing out equipment before its time," says =
Jay Shogren, a University of Wyoming economist and a former Clinton administ=
ration official.=20
Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachus=
etts Institute of Technology and economist in the former administration of G=
eorge H. W. Bush, predicts that the U.S. would have to close all of its coal=
-fired power plants by 2012 just to get halfway to Kyoto's targets. Alan Man=
ne, a retired Stanford University professor, says his model shows that the a=
ccord, depending on how it is implemented, could amount to a $400 tax annual=
ly on every U.S. individual.=20
Of course, plenty of environmentalists and some economists disagree with the=
se cost estimates, especially since the accord was revised in July. Negotiat=
ors in Bonn took two big steps to soften the blow to industry. First, they a=
llowed countries to get credit for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by plan=
ting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Second, they al=
lowed countries to trade credits for emissions reductions, so they could kee=
p industrial plants running by purchasing other countries' rights to pollute=
=2E=20
According to one MIT analysis, the cost to the U.S. of implementing Kyoto co=
uld be cut to $140 per household, or less per individual, if regulators can =
implement such a global trading system efficiently.=20
Jeff Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School =
of Government, says the economic argument for a go-slow approach is flawed. =
"If you wait 20 years and then try to do it, in the meantime [companies] wil=
l build a whole lot more coal-fired plants," he says. Mr. Frankel, who was P=
resident Clinton's former chief economic adviser, says that it would make se=
nse for the U.S. to get back on the Kyoto path and says that the costs of im=
plementing the accord aren't nearly as high as some critics have claimed.=20
Indeed, some of President Bush's biggest corporate supporters, including uti=
lity concern Enron Corp., have already signed on to efforts to push for gree=
nhouse-gas reductions.=20
Environmental economists have a second concern over Kyoto: It doesn't includ=
e developing countries like China and India, creating what economists call "=
emissions leakage."=20
Robert Stavins, a Harvard University environmental economist, says much of t=
he increase in emissions in coming years will be from the developing world, =
which is growing more quickly and uses energy less efficiently. If those cou=
ntries aren't included, polluting industries will just move offshore, he say=
s, rendering the cuts in the U.S. and the rest of the developed world far le=
ss effective. "The impacts [of Kyoto] are trivial, but the cost was going to=
 be quite severe," says Mr. Stavins.=20

After Short, Volatile Tenure, U.S. Energy Regulator Quits
By JOSEPH KAHN

Page 11, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- Curt L. Hebert Jr., the chairman of the Federal Energy=
 Regulatory Commission, said today that he would resign this month after a s=
hort, volatile tenure marked by repeated clashes with California politicians=
, Congressional Democrats and influential industry executives.=20
President Bush, who appointed Mr. Hebert in January, accepted the resignatio=
n, which White House officials said was voluntary. Analysts expect Mr. Bush =
to name Pat Wood III, a fellow Texan who is now a commissioner of the federa=
l agency, as its chairman.
Mr. Hebert presided over a bitter debate -- inside his agency and with compa=
nies and politicians nationwide -- over the role of the federal regulator in=
 policing newly deregulated electricity and natural gas markets.=20
A free-market Republican, Mr. Hebert for months resisted imposing price caps=
 on California's electricity market. He said California should take responsi=
bility for its high electricity prices because it did not build enough power=
 plants and botched electricity deregulation.=20
But he came under heavy pressure to enforce his agency's New Deal-era mandat=
e to guarantee ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates. And, in May, he di=
d an about-face and agreed to impose broad controls on electricity prices in=
 California and other Western states.=20
California officials say mild weather, increased supply and successful conse=
rvation efforts helped them avoid what they once thought would be a summer o=
f frequent blackouts and soaring prices.=20
There was no sign of a rift between Mr. Hebert and the White House. His stea=
dfast opposition to price controls and his eventual use of them coincided wi=
th a similar shift in position by the Bush administration.=20
Mr. Hebert, a former Mississippi regulator and lawmaker, was also a close al=
ly of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi and other senior Republicans in Cong=
ress.=20
But Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview in April that Mr. Bush i=
ntended to appoint Mr. Wood, whom he named an agency commissioner in the spr=
ing, as its chairman. Mr. Cheney did not say at the time why Mr. Hebert shou=
ld be replaced.=20
The Bush administration had no role in encouraging Mr. Hebert to resign, Ann=
 Womack, a White House spokeswoman, said today. She said the president ''app=
reciates his service as chairman.''=20
Mr. Bush and Mr. Wood worked closely together in Texas, where Mr. Wood overs=
aw the state's telecommunications and electricity industries.=20
Some leading energy companies, including the Enron Corporation of Houston, a=
lso strongly supported Mr. Wood, arguing that he would move more assertively=
 than Mr. Hebert to open local electricity markets to national competition. =
Enron is a national energy trading company and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay,=
 was a leading financial backer of Mr. Bush.=20
One of Mr. Hebert's adversaries, Gov. Gray Davis of California, who tangled =
with him over price caps, welcomed news of the resignation.=20
''The governor is looking forward to the president appointing a new F.E.R.C.=
 commissioner who will be more responsive to the needs of California, which =
has been overcharged by greedy out-of-state generators,'' said Hilary McLean=
, a spokeswoman for Mr. Davis.=20
Though the president can appoint a chairman from among the agency's commissi=
oners at any time, Mr. Hebert could choose to serve out his term as a commis=
sioner, which ends in 2004. But he said in a statement that he would leave t=
he agency. He announced no future plans.

Shell Grp Seeking Partnership With Japanese Pwr, Gas Cos
By Maki Aoto
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) aims to enter Japan's downs=
tream electric power and gas businesses in partnerships with local utility c=
ompanies, to take advantage of its strong presence in the liquefied natural =
gas market, a company official said.=20
In the face of ongoing industry deregulation, Shell aims to "do something ne=
w together with power and gas companies," Goro Naito, manager of Shell Gas &=
 Power Japan Ltd.'s business department, told Dow Jones Newswires in a recen=
t interview.
Japan is the world's largest LNG importer, buying about 54 million metric to=
ns a year, or more than half the world demand and Naito said Shell has been =
in the LNG business with Japan for more than 30 years. Shell handles about 4=
5% of Japan's LNG imports, with stakes in projects in Brunei, Malaysia, Aust=
ralia and Oman.=20
Japan's gradual deregulation in the long-protected gas and power sectors beg=
an in 1995 and has created new business opportunities for non-utilities incl=
uding foreign companies. Although the number of newcomers has been limited, =
many are preparing to exploit opportunities as Japan moves to further deregu=
late the industries.=20
Under current regulations, about 28% of the country's Y15 trillion retail po=
wer market is open for free competition. Independent power providers, or IPP=
s, can sell electricity to existing regional power companies in the wholesal=
e market.=20
In the gas sector, non-gas utilities are allowed to sell retail gas to large=
-lot users like large factories, company headquarters and big hotels.=20
However, Shell doesn't intend to compete with traditional utility companies =
- which themselves are Shell's LNG customers - in the deregulated market, Na=
ito said.=20
Japan will review in March 2003 the impact of partial deregulation on the po=
wer industry. A Trade ministry panel is discussing aspects of the gas-indust=
ry deregulation Japan should aim for in the future.=20
Shell Talking With Number Of LNG Customers=20

Shell is approaching existing gas and power companies about jointly overcomi=
ng the challenges posed by limited liberalization, rather than aiming to tak=
e a lead in pressing for further deregulation, Naito said.=20
Shell is talking with a number of utilities, including Tokyo Electric Power =
Co. (J.TER or 9501), Kansai Electric Power Co. (J.KEP or 9503), Chubu Electr=
ic Power Co. (J.CEP or 9502). It is also seeking partnerships with three maj=
or gas companies, Tokyo Gas Co. (J.TYG or 9531), Osaka Gas Co. (J.OSG or 953=
2) and Toho Gas Co. (J.THG or 9533).=20
"Shell possesses a wide range of business expertise, from LNG shipping, term=
inal operations to power trading...We'll do whatever, depending on their nee=
ds," Naito said. He added that Shell hasn't yet decided on a specific projec=
t for a possible tie-up.=20
"Unlike companies like Enron, we can't control the timeframe if we are to ti=
e with power and gas (companies)," Naito said. He said Shell will be closely=
 watching future courses of Japan's deregulation.=20
In what will be a direct challenge to traditional Japanese power companies, =
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) New-York based power venture, EnCom Corp., plans to buil=
d a large-scale gas-fired power project in northern Japan. Construction is s=
cheduled to begin in 2004 for commercial operation in 2007 or later.=20
"We won't dare compete with power and gas companies," Naito said. He ruled o=
ut the possibility that Shell would build a power plant in Japan on its own =
or sell LNG directly to IPPs in Japan.=20

Supreme court stays MERC Dabhol proceedings

THE SUPREME Court on Monday stayed the proceedings before the Maharashtra El=
ectricity Regulatory Commission on the Enron dispute, asking the Mumbai High=
 Court to take another look on the issue.=20
The apex court asked the high court to decide whether MERC had the jurisdict=
ion to adjudicate the differences between the Maharashtra State Electricity =
Board and the Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company.
In other words, the Supreme Court has asked the high court to decide whether=
 or not Dabhol can take the dispute to the International Court of Arbitratio=
n in London.=20
Earlier, MSEB had sought that the dispute over arbitration be addressed by M=
ERC and the same was upheld by the Mumbai High Court, following which DPC an=
d later 11 of its international lenders filed a special leave petition with =
the Supreme Court, questioning the jurisdiction of MERC and pleaded that the=
 sanctity of the arbitration agreement be upheld.=20
The Supreme Court on Monday directed that the proceedings before the MERC be=
 stayed and no further order be passed by MERC. It has also directed that th=
e interim orders be continued pending a decision by the high court over juri=
sdiction.=20
This means that the arbitration proceedings would be kept in abeyance till t=
hat time. It has also directed the Mumbai High Court to hear the matter expe=
ditiously.=20
When contacted, an Enron spokesman said the company was "very pleased" with =
the ruling. "The favourable ruling gives further support to DPCs faith in th=
e Indian legal system as it is widely known that the Dabhol project has prev=
iously been upheld in over 25 cases before courts in India including the Sup=
reme Court," a company statement said here on Monday.=20
Representatives of 11 different international lenders, including the US gove=
rnments Overseas Private Investment Corp, to DPC, also argued before the cou=
rt claiming that they had relied on arbitration provisions of the PPA while =
lending over $444 million to the project for swift and impartial resolution =
of disputes between the two estranged partners.=20
The current round of litigation started when the MERC said that DPCs dispute=
 with MSEB fell within its ambit and Dabhol could not proceed with the arbit=
ration.

THE EDITORIAL 'Shock therapy' (ET, August 1) suggests that Enron's boss Kenn=
eth Lay applied such therapy to Maharashtra's government by stating that his=
 company has given up on India and is willing to pull out of Dabhol Power Co=
mpany.
The million dollar question is whether Enron can really do so. The answer: t=
he probability of Enron being able to sellout its equity stake in DPC is neg=
ligible.=20
There will be no takers. Four states have expressed unwillingness to buy DPC=
's high-cost power. MSEB is left as the sole 'unwilling-to-reform and bankru=
pt customer'.=20

THE heaviest element known was recently discovered by physicists at Yale's R=
esearch Center. Tentatively named 'administratium', it has no protons or ele=
ctrons and thus an atomic number of 0.=20
But it does have one neutron, 125 assistant-neutrons, 75 vice-neutrons and 1=
1 assistant vice-neutrons. These add up to an atomic mass of 312; particles =
cohere in the nucleus through a force that involves a continuous exchange of=
 meson-like particles, 'morons'.=20
Lacking electrons, administratium is inert, but it does have a chemical sign=
ature: detection is straightforward as it impedes every reaction it comes in=
 contact with.=20
The discoverers say a minute amount of administratium caused a reaction to t=
ake over four days to end finally although, normally, less than a second wou=
ld have sufficed.=20
Nor does administratium decay over its normal life of about three years; it =
undergoes a reorganisation in which assistant-neutrons, vice-neutrons and as=
sistant vice-neutrons exchange places and the atomic weight usually increase=
s thereafter.=20
Research also indicates that administratium occurs quite naturally in the at=
mosphere. Typically, concentration occurs at nodal points like government ag=
encies, large corporations, universities and hospitals.=20
Scientists caution that administratium is toxic at any level of concentratio=
n and will easily destroy other, productive, reactions in its vicinity. Atte=
mpts are on to see how to rein in administratium and prevent irreversible da=
mage, but till date the results are not promising.=20

d Tractors has done extremely well in the Indian tractor industry in a short=
 span of five years, and has achieved a growth of over 125 per cent on the p=

Given this performance in a year when industry demand declined by nearly 10 =

NEW DELHI, Aug. 6. THE Supreme Court today stayed the arbitration proceeding=
s initiated by Enron and asked the Bombay High Court to decide whether the M=
aharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had the jurisdiction to =
adjudicate the dispute with Dabhol Power Company (DPC).=20
"We are of the view that... it is appropriate that the High Court should dec=
ide the issue of jurisdiction...," observed a Bench comprising Mr Justice S.=
P. Bharucha and Mr Justice Y.K. Sabharwal while allowing an appeal by DPC.
The appeal was directed against the June 26 order of the High Court dismissi=
ng DPC's writ petition challenging the invocation of the jurisdiction of MER=
C by MSEB and an interim order by MERC made on May 29.=20
DPC has argued that MSEB did not have the right to cancel the power purchase=
 contract. It said that the regulator was created in 1999, after the power p=
urchase contract was signed. The board had referred the dispute to the MERC.=
=20
The apex court said that MERC should not pass any order on the application m=
ade before it by MSEB until such time the High Court hears the parties and d=

=20
"Equally, the arbitration proceedings initiated at the instance of DPC shall=
 not go on till the High Court decides the question of jurisdiction.=20
The interim order passed by MERC, however, shall continue to operate," the j=
udges added. Earlier, the court dismissed as withdrawn an interlocutory appl=
ication by DPC, seeking permission to raise additional grounds before it and=
 permitted raising of the same before an appropriate forum.=20
Dabhol pleased: DPC said it was "extremely pleased" with the decision of the=
 apex court.=20
"The favourable ruling gives further support to DPC's faith in the Indian le=
gal system as it is widely known that the Dabhol project has previously been=

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the arbitration pro ceedings i=

t of Rs 500-crore dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and r=
eferred the mat ter to the Bombay High Court. The DPC said it was ``extremel=

The court urged the high court to decide on the Maharashtra Electricity Regu=
latory Commission's (MERC) jurisdiction to adjudicate the US energy major's =
$ 48 million payment dis pute with the MSEB.
Reacting to the order, Dabhol Power Company director Jimmy Mogal said in a s=
tatement: ``The favourable ruling gives further support to DPC's faith in th=
e Indian legal system as it is widely known that Dabhol project has previous=
ly been upheld in over 25 cases before courts in India, including the SC''.=20
A Bench comprising Justice SP Bharucha and Justice YK Sabharwal allowed the =
DPC's petition challen ging the June 26 order of the Bombay high court that =
the MERC, being an expert body, had jurisdiction to hear the dispute.=20
However, the Bench said, ``Until such time the high court finally hears and =
decides the writ petition filed by the DPC challenging the jurisdiction of t=
he MERC, the MERC will not pass further orders on the application that has b=
een made before it by the MSEB.''=20
The Bench also ruled that during that time, arbitration proceedings commence=
d by the DPC will not be proceeded with. But it added till the high court de=
cides the writ petition, the interim orders passed by the MERC will continue=
=2E=20
By its June 29 interim order, the MERC had restrained the DPC from resorting=
 to international arbitration and invoking of Escrow account from the banks.=
 While the DPC, a company formed by Enron, General Electric, Bechtel Enterpr=
ises Inc and Mahrash tra Power Development Corporation with an investment of=
 Rs 13,610 crore at present, had alleged that the MSEB was not making punctu=
al and full pay ment for electricity drawn by it, the MSEB had alleged that =
the DPC owed it over Rs 500 crore as rebates under the PPA.=20
The DPC and the MSEB entered into the litigation after the state board claim=
ed a rebate of over Rs 540 crore under PPA, alleging that there was shortfal=
l in delivery of energy. By its February 28, 2001, letter the MSEB claimed r=
ebates of Rs 401,23,74,935, and later made another claim of Rs 142,68,67,696=
=2E=20
The DPC disputed the interpretation of the rebate provisions under PPA as al=
so the rebate claimed by the MSEB. The matter was then referred to dis pute =
resolution panel under the agree ment on December 8, 1993. The panel failed =
to resolve the dispute, leading the DPC to give arbitration notice on April =
12. The MSEB had by then ap proached the MERC. It restrained the DPC from pr=
oceeding further with the arbitration notice while holding that it had juris=
diction to adjudicate the dis pute between parties in view of the lar ger pu=
blic interest.=20
The DPC then approached the high court, seeking a declaration that the MERC =
had no jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate any dispute or differen ces b=
etween the parties from the PPA.

The Supreme Court today ruled that the Bombay High Court is the appropriate =
authority to rule on the jurisdiction of various disputes between the Enron-=
promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and the Maharashtra State Electricity Bo=
ard (MSEB).=20
DPC had brought the issue before the Supreme Court in a special leave petiti=
on, wherein it contested the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Electricity Reg=
ulatory Commission (MERC) over various disputes it had with MSEB.
A Division Bench, comprising Justices S P Bharucha and Y K Sabharwal, refuse=
d to allow DPC to initiate international arbitration proceedings in London a=
nd also restrained it from operationalising the escrow account for the secon=
d phase of the project.=20
Earlier, the Bombay High Court in its June 26 order had directed DPC to go b=
ack to MERC. It had ruled that DPC's moving of the High Court was premature =
when the commission itself was yet to decide on its jurisdiction.=20
The apex court said: "It is appropriate that the Bombay High Court should de=
cide all disputes relating to the jurisdiction of MERC as raised in the peti=
tion filed by DPC." It also directed the High Court to hear the matter exped=
itiously.=20
"Until such time the High Court finally hears and decides the writ petition =
filed by DPC challenging MERC jurisdiction, the commission will not pass fur=
ther orders on the application that has been made before it by MSEB," the co=
urt said.=20
"Equally during that time, arbitration proceedings commenced by DPC will not=
 be proceeded with," the Bench said, adding "till the High Court decides the=
 writ petition, the interim orders passed by the commission will continue." =
The commission in its interim order on June 29 had ruled that DPC should nei=
ther operationalise the escrow account nor go in for arbitration.=20
The order also said that it would decide on the issue of its jurisdiction so=
on.=20
While DPC has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, a state government official=
 contended that this was not a defeat for MSEB. "Since, the apex court has n=
ot allowed operationalising of the escrow account or allowing DPC to go in f=
or arbitration," it should not be construed as a defeat for MSEB, the offici=
al remarked.=20
DPC in a statement stated that it is extremely pleased with the Supreme Cour=
t ruling. "The favourable ruling gives further support to DPC's historical f=
aith in the Indian legal system. It is widely known that the Dabhol project =

Reliant unit goes on the sales block=20
70 lose jobs in Internet, telecommunications unit=20
By MICHAEL DAVIS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Reliant Resources put its Internet and telecommunications business up for sa=
le Monday and laid off half of the struggling unit's employees.=20
Some 70 workers in Houston and Austin, mostly in Houston, were let go. About=
 the same number remain working for the Internet/communications business, sa=
id Mark Slaughter, president of Reliant Energy Communications.=20
Reliant Resources entered the telecommunications business as a competitive l=
ocal exchange carrier in late 1999. The company later added Internet service=
s in April 2000 when it bought Insync Internet Services, an Internet service=
 provider, for about $10 million.=20
Since that time the telecommunications business has slowed, and energy compa=
nies have generally had disappointing results from their forays into such se=
rvices. Earlier this year Enron scaled back its broadband business because i=
t was not growing as quickly as the company first expected.=20
In announcing the move, Reliant Resources said it is "exploring strategic op=
tions" for its Reliant Energy Communications, which provides business custom=
ers in Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas with Internet, data and voice=
 transport services.=20
These options would include partnerships with similar players and/or the sal=
e of certain lines of business, the company said.=20
Reliant Resources shares closed Monday at $21.94, down $1.12 per share. They=
 have fallen 27 percent since they were first offered on April 30.=20
Reliant Energy Communications just never took off.=20
"Two things happened: our revenues were not growing at the rate that we had =
anticipated, and the market environment was such that we concluded our relat=
ively small size put us at a disadvantage to our competitors," Slaughter sai=
d.=20
The company said it was hindered as well by its limited geographic scope.=20
It was not clear Monday whether Reliant Resources' Internet/communications b=
usiness was profitable, because the company does not separate the business f=
rom its three main divisions in its quarterly and annual reports. Slaughter =
would not disclose whether the business was profitable or how much the compa=
ny has invested in it, other than to say it is a "start-up" business for Rel=
iant Resources.=20
It is not a substantial contributor to the company's bottom line, a company =
spokeswoman said. The Houston company last month reported second quarter net=
 income of $143 million, the majority of which came from the company's whole=
sale energy business including power sales and trading.=20
Slaughter said the company was in the very early stages of talking to potent=
ial purchasers or partners for the business.=20
The company owns a telecommunications network and has constructed fiber opti=
c connections to several Houston-area office towers. It has more than 130 mi=
les of fiber connecting campuses in two major public school districts. The c=
ompany owns Internet data centers in Houston and Austin.=20
Reliant Resources was spun off from Reliant Energy earlier this year. It too=
k all of the unregulated businesses which Reliant Energy had been operating,=
 such as wholesale power sales and generation as well as the company's Europ=
ean power business. Reliant Energy retained the company's regulated utilitie=
s of HL&P and Entex.=20

FERC chief to resign within weeks=20

WASHINGTON -- Curt Hebert Jr., head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commiss=

to resign his post at the end of the month.=20
Pat Wood III, the former chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, is=
 widely expected to be named to succeed Hebert, although no announcement has=
 been made.=20
Past FERC leaders had been all but invisible to the general public.=20
Then blackouts started rolling across California this year. Both gas and ele=
ctricity prices in the state skyrocketed. And California Gov. Gray Davis and=
 other Democrats accused the commission, which regulates the natural gas and=
 electric power industries, of failing to act.=20
Hebert, 38, a Republican and close associate of Senate GOP leader Trent Lott=
 of Mississippi, took the helm of the commission in the midst of the Califor=
nia crisis and quickly became a target for much of the criticism.=20
Hebert was reluctant to intervene aggressively in California's troubles. Rat=
her than imposing rigid price caps on wholesale electricity sold in the stat=
e, he supported more modest "soft" price caps, which have been credited for =
helping to rein in power prices there.=20
"I came to this job a strong advocate of free markets and, if anything, my t=
ime on the commission has only strengthened this belief," Hebert said. "We n=
eed to get the rules right, but it is free enterprise that will put more and=
 more consumers in the winner's circle."=20
President Bush made Wood his point man on the California crisis. He sent Woo=
d and his other newly appointed commissioner, Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylv=
ania, to discuss the crisis with California's leaders.=20
Responding to Hebert's resignation Monday, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean s=
aid: "Governor Davis is looking forward to President Bush appointing a new F=
ERC commissioner who, like his previous appointees, will be responsive to th=
e people of California."=20
Hebert was not available for an interview Monday. The former Mississippi law=
maker and state regulator was appointed to the commission in 1997 by Preside=
nt Clinton. Bush elevated him to the chairman's slot in January.=20
"It has been a pleasure and honor ... to have had the opportunity to serve a=
t the altar of freedom for this country," Hebert wrote in a letter sent to B=
ush on Friday and made public Monday.=20
Intelligent, articulate but often prickly, Hebert saw his brief tenure as ch=
airman marked by persistent rumors he was to be supplanted by Wood.=20
At a commission meeting in June, Hebert stunned the audience by announcing t=
he five-member commission would appear quite different at the next meeting. =
He then explained how the commissioners' desks would be rearranged.=20
In May, Hebert got in a public row with Houston-based Enron when he accused =
Enron Chairman Ken Lay of prodding him to support retail competition in the =
electricity market in exchange for Lay's political support at the White Hous=
e.=20
"I was offended," Hebert was quoted as saying in a story in the New York Tim=
es. Enron disputes Hebert's characterization of the conversation, noting tha=
t Hebert -- not Lay -- initiated the calls alluded to in the story.=20
Enron officials declined to comment on Hebert's resignation Monday.=20

Neither Houston-based Enron nor American Water Works officials would disclos=

John Ambler, Enron's vice president of international public relations, said =

Terms of the acquisition won't be released until certain filings are made wi=
th the Securities and Exchange Commission, American Water spokeswoman Nancy =
Macenko said. The transaction will probably be completed within 90 days, she=
 said.=20
Enron, which controls two-thirds of Azurix Corp., of which Azurix North Amer=
ica is a unit, took Azurix private in March for $327.5 million. The decision=

Azurix provides water and wastewater services, including operations and main=

GAO May Issue Report on Cheney's Refusal to Name Company Chiefs
2001-08-06 18:11 (New York)

GAO May Issue Report on Cheney's Refusal to Name Company Chiefs

     Washington, August 6 (Bloomberg) -- The General Accounting
Office may issue a report as a prelude to a lawsuit over Vice
President Dick Cheney's refusal to name the corporate executives
who met with his energy task force, the head of the agency said.
The report to Congress and the President would be issued if the
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, can't resolve the standoff
with Cheney over releasing the names. The next step might be a
suit against the Bush administration, David Walker, the agency's
comptroller general, said.
     ``GAO firmly believes we have statutory authority to perform
this review, and to obtain the information we are seeking,''
Walker said in a statement sent to the White House.
     The GAO warning follows refusals by Cheney to turn over task
force documents. Cheney said in a letter to Congress last week
that Walker's demands ``exceed his lawful authority'' and could
``unconstitutionally interfere'' with White House duties.
     Conoco Inc. Chief Executive Archie Dunham, Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth Lay and Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Lee Raymond were
among the energy company officials who told Bloomberg News they
met with Cheney while the energy strategy was being formulated.
     Leaders of environmental groups have said they were relegated
to making their case to members of Cheney's staff.
     The GAO has demanded that Cheney disclose the identities of
all the industry leaders who met with his task force. Democrats in
Congress have questioned whether the administration was influenced
by the energy industry when it issued a report in May calling for
more oil exploration in the U.S., the construction of more
pipelines and power plants, as well as conservation measures.

                       Costs and Activities

     Walker said that Cheney's criticism overstated the agency's
requests. He is seeking details on costs of the energy policy task
force's activities, and about Cheney's role as chairman. Walker
said he was unsuccessful in trying to speak with Cheney last week.
     ``We are not interested in obtaining his daily schedule or in
reviewing communications involving the President, Vice
President,'' or their top aides, Walker said. ``The information we
are requesting is purely factual in nature and relates solely to
the process used by the group.''
     The White House has said decisions about the energy plan
weren't influenced by corporate interests, and that GAO's demands
are part of an effort to stall progress on the president's
proposals.
     ``The investigation is bogus harassment by those Democrats
who clearly do not or cannot engage in the issue,''  Mary Matalin,
Cheney's chief political adviser, has said.
     Last week, the House of Representatives passed legislation
that would enact parts of the Bush administration's energy
strategy, including plans to let oil companies drill in a portion
of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Senate plans to
take up the legislation in September, though Democrats Joe
