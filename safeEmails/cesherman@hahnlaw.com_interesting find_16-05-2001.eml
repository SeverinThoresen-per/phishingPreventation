well, we finally received from counsel for one of the co-defendants - after =
much hounding - the key filings from the previous shultes case . . . and it =
looks like our decision not to pitch in for a lawyer for nsm managment co. (=
"nsm co.") was a smart move.  it turns out that when the plaintiff moved to =
add nsm co., our co-defendants' attorneys (who we have every reason to belie=
ve are going to effectively control nsm co's counsel) actually opposed the p=
laintiff's motion on the grounds, inter alia, that if the court allowed the =
amendment, THEY would have to bring in enron!  thanks a lot.  now we know wh=
ere the plaintiff got the idea to sue enron.  thankfully, however, plaintiff=
's counsel disputed that enron was liable and would have to be brought in! y=
ou can be sure we will figure out a way to get these helpful statements into=
 the motions we are drafting.
