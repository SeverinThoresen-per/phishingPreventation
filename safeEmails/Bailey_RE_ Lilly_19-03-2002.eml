Dona,

I had really great time, and hope the remainder of your weekend went well.

I would love to join you all this week for drinks with the girls, just let m=
e know the evening.

I usually see my trainer on Tuesday & Thursday, but could skip Thursday if t=
hat would be one of the drink nights.

Also Bear & I would love to go walking again sometime before Lilly leaves.

Susan=20
