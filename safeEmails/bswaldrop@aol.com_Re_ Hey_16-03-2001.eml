I am going to try and get out of here around 4:00.  I need to go get my car
washed, etc.  I am supposed to hear from Susie about that time.  She will

work are going to be out and about tonight, too.

You know we actually need to start spending time together outside of the
alcohol.  At least a little earlier than 10:00 at night.  I really don't eve=

know if I like you.  Ha! Ha!

Well, I looked at my work schedule and those dates should work.  I just need
to talk to Judi.  We will be in the middle of month end, but I am thinking
that everything could be finished by that time.

I'll talk with you in a little bit! =20
