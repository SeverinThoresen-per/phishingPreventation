Alan/Harry,

I can't remember which of you two lucky souls are looking after coal.

We have modified the Coal Products somewhat.=20

Previously, we showed Product Types for US Coal Nymex Phy Fwd, US Coal=20
PRB8400 Phy Fwd and US Coal PRB880 Phy Fwd.
We are in the process of replacing this with a single Product Type: US Coal=20
Phy Fwd, which has various delivery locations. This is more of a logical=20
change than anything else, and the long descriptions have been edited only=20
slightly from what was there before. Please review the following and let us=20
know if it meets your approval.

Thanks,

Dave
