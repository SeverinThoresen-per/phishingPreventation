Tom/Sally,
The Financial and Power Confirmation team performed testing this morning as =
well as this afternoon on the ConfirmLogic module.  Testing went extremely w=
ell in both cases.  We feel very comfortable with the functionality and disp=
lay of information contained within the module.  All of our major issues hav=
e been resolved.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that Confir=
mLogic is ready for release to the Beta Customers for testing.  Below is a c=
omprehensive list of the current business parameters as well as the business=
 issues to be discussed and resolved during Beta testing.
