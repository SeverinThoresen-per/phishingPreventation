Greg,

I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed th=
e deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreemen=
t.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What will=
 happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since the =
land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute an a=
dditional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.

You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me p=
reviously.  Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not l=
ooking at old numbers.  Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of true c=
osts and expected loan.

Thank you,

Phillip

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanci=
ng act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is perf=
ected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to ge=
t it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means it wi=
ll be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for signat=
ure and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to make sur=
e you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal and=
 gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built is=
 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $1,1=
20,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Januar=
y.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top of t=
his showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to show an=
 increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce our overa=
ll loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost and some=
 other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall debt and re=
sultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a greater l=
oan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be out of balan=
ce in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk being short an=
d needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have been working on=
 this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effects each change=
 will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have =
had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the ov=
erall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging which=
 has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundation/=
concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Thus, o=
verall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the f=
inal Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.

I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any que=
stions today.
