The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas comin=
g=20
to us from them.  The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted. The Tribo=20
deal is good.  If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.  (I don't think the=
y=20
have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.)  Carlos probably has a contat=
=20
with Cox.  Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of=20
their interests.

Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve.

Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E=20
Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase=20
agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I=20
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at=20
Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to=
=20
be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this=20
gas.

We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will no=
t=20
know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to=20
reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confir=
m=20
and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the=20
producer level.

Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at=20
the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected=20
volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interes=
t=20
in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas=20
after all.
