I have an electric fogger, Amy, if youwould like to use it. However, i must =
caution that it does use strong chemicals like the County fogger trucks. I u=
se it and keep my dog inside for an hour or so until the smell dissapates. I=
t has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust hook up to you hose=
 and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is non-toxic and works=
 really well also.=20

Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.=20

I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.

The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) a=
ny more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
=20
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little=
 pests, and I want to do something about it.
=20
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris C=
ounty Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load =
of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
=20
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hour=
s are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
=20
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.
=20
Best Regards,
