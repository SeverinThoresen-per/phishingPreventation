We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with=
 Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a s=
tructure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short po=
sition in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  =
I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the le=
gal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract and=
 the requirements for this potential deal.  Notional terms:

NP-15
