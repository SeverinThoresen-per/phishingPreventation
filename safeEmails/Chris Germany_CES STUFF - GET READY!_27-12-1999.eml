Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my=20
head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.

Transport
I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st,=20
all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located=20
at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the=20
retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.

Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset=20
management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Goo=
d=20
question.

Good Luck

Have fun ;)
