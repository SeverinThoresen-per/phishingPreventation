The Doorstep team will wish to visit any MG trading locations in order to do=

deal testing.  In order to weed out the origination offices from trading=20
offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were=20
unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.

1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) Enron=20
people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire=20
(Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of =
a=20
trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on=20
Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as=

Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).

2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to=20
get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order fo=
r=20
you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whethe=
r=20
their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed=20
(or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy,=20
Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the=20

needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to=20
