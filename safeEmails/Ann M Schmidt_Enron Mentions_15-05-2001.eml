The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million=
=20
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake=20

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The=20
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery=20

Corp.=20
The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract.=
=20
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years=
=20
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water.=20
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 4=
0=20
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build.=
=20
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times,=
=20
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices.=20
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000=20
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to=20
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant=
=20
expansion for $32 million.=20
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined.=20
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a=
=20
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds=
=20
itself.=20
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay=
=20
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant=
=20
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This=20
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could=20
cost about $2 billion to implement.=20
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure=20

The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In=20
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who=20

The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been=20

Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new=20

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp=

said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45=

"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD=20

Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that=20

But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high=20
