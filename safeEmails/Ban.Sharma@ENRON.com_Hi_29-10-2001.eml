Rick:

Its been a long time and things are coming to their logical end. I thought I=
 would briefly update you on developments here. We are all eagerly awaiting =
the 19th of November when in all likelihood we would be serving the Terminat=
ion  Notice (TN) to the state government. Thereafter the assets would be tra=
nsfered to the State Utility and we would want to proceed to London for inte=
rnational arbitration. There may be a few hurdles in the sense that we alrea=
dy have some cases lined against us in various Indian courts. Its not clear =
if we can proceed as smoothly as the way I have described in the initial lin=
es.

We had an all employee meeting , a few days back, and Wade informed us of th=
e recent developments. Post that he did indicate in no uncertain terms the f=
uture of all the employees here. Give and take I expect that our services he=
re would be required at max till the time the TN is served, post that our co=
ntracts could be severed. Some relocations and some severances have already =
started and its a matter of time before my turn arrives.

I would like to explore possible future employment opportunities under you, =
in Houston. It would give me immense pleasure if I could in any way continue=
 to contribute to the activities of the division.=20

Any advice from you would boost my morale

Warm Regards
Ban
