Ladies,

Attached is a spreadsheet showing the cost for each of the Tiffany items you=
 want to see.  Included are the 15% discount, 100 minimum quantity, tax.  It=
's also assuming that I can negotiate free shipping.  I think we need to sta=
y under $10,000.  Even if we end up splitting it 3 ways, I would be afraid t=
o go much higher.  Given that, I'll ask Leslie with Tiffany to bring everyth=
ing under $100.
