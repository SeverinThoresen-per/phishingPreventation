Edward,

I thought I noticed a Senior designation and thought it kind of strange. =20

Yes, all the documents were provided to E&Y in hard copy form in the binders=
 delivered to Raj last week.  The only document not included was the Florida=
 Power & Light Company ("FPL") agreement.   However, under the EWS-CCT addre=
ss you now possess all the Master Netting Agreements (including the FPL agre=
ement) in the electronic/pdf format.   =20

If you want to present E&Y with the electronic/pdf versions, you will need t=
o do that.

Susan,

Thank you for sending all those emails to the EWS-CCT address.  I noticed th=
at the Ed Hlopak you sent the original emails to was the Ed, Sr - my father.=
  He used to work at EE&CC.

Have these files already been sent to E&Y?  If not, I'll get it done right a=
way.
