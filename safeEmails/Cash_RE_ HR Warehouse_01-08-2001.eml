I'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.  Can that be =
rectified, or is that beyond your role?

Hello everyone!
The purpose of this e-mail is to tell you about a new program which we are r=
olling out that will benefit the ENTIRE ENRON HR COMMUNITY.
It is called the HR Warehouse.
It is a collection of folders located on the O Drive  which have been set up=
 to increase communication between the various BUs' HR groups.
The idea was born out of our experiences in the HR Forum, where various memb=
ers of the Enron HR community would share ideas, goings on, etc.
The primary goal is to increase efficiency.  Why re-create the wheel when it=
 is already on the road elsewhere?
We all have a variety of programs, processes, forms, etc. which we use in ou=
r daily work life.
Through this repository, you can now share your ideas with others, and put t=
heir ideas to work for you.
Also, there is a parking lot for HR related questions, where you will be abl=
e to get answers/ advice for whatever problems/ issues you are dealing with.
The document below is the framework for this program.
The only way this will be effective, however, is for people to use it!
I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders, and nee=
d your assistance.
Can you please e-mail me a list of EE's who you feel would benefit from the =
HR Warehouse (actually, everyone could, but we need to restrict access!).
Also, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.=20
Thank you!

Sunjay
