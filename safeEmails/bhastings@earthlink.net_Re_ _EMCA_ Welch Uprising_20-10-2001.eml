^Well, on my walk this morning , at the corner of Welch and Crocker, I stopp=
ed to watch, yet another, street crew about to dig up Welch.  Evidently, the=
 response was so immediate from our "concerned citizens" that theCity had th=
e contractor put his equipment back on the truck and leave.  A security guar=
d was standing watch to make sure there was no uprising.  So I guess those c=
alls help, at least in this time of impending elections.=20
