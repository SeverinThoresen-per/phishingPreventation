	Richard,

	Today Stacy and I spoke with Mike Farrell, Adkins' attorney.  It was brief =
and to the point.  I told him that his August 8, 2001 demand letter makes no=
 reference to a verbal deal for a fixed price done on March 6 that was confi=
rmed in writing by fax to his client on March 8.  Farrell told me that Adkin=
s had not advised him of any such deal.  Farrell, who is quick on his feet, =
asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect.   Once=
 he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counter-party=
 signature, Farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue, given that t=
he deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year.

	However, there are at least two counter-arguments.  First, the underlying b=
ase contract that was assigned to ENA from CES was signed by Adkins; in fact=
, to that base contract is attached a confirm for one-year floating index pr=
ice deal with an evergreen clause, which I think is the deal Adkins is tryin=
g to enforce--and that confirm is signed only by CES.  Second, since (as Joh=
n confirmed for me a moment ago) we hedged the fixed price deal, we may have=
 good promissory estoppel arguments sufficient to trump a statute of frauds =
argument.

	Farrell also mentioned a conversation with Wade Price in ENA Customer Servi=
ce, during which Price advised Adkins that Adkins in fact had a floating pri=
ce contract.  I asked Farrell when that conversation occurred, and Farrell c=
ould only say that it ocurred some time in the year 2000. Stacy and I are fo=
llowing up with Price on this.  Preliminarily, such a conversation could hav=
e occurred; however, we so far appear to have a very reasonable explanation.=
 =20

	In brief, our back office was drinking from a fire hose during the time of =
the CES contract assimilation, and this and other deals were not getting ent=
ered into the correct system.  For that reason, (a) ENA continued to pay Adk=
ins based on the old floating index price from some months after March 2000,=
 until this and other mispayment issues were caught by an internal audit, an=
d (b) if Price had been called by Adkins before the corrections were made wo=
uld have assumed, based on what was in the system at the time, that the old =
floating index price contract was still current.  Price keeps a log of phone=
 calls and will be reviewing them in preparation for a further interview by =
us.

	As Stacy mentioned, the really interesting point is the timing of Adkin's p=
urported call.  Although this remains speculation at present, Adkins would h=
ave been losing money for the first several months, maybe until around July-=
August 2000, as the index was under the fixed price during that time period.=
  However, Adkins may not have been on notice of this until he received the =
first couple of checks.  Given that payment for Appalachian gas runs a month=
 or so slower than elsewhere,  Adkins may not have received those checks unt=
il July-August.  By around August 1, the Appalachian index price had already=
 risen above the fixed price.  In other words, with the benefit of being sev=
eral months down the road, Adkins realized that this was going to be a banne=
r year for Appalachian gas prices during the later heating season (and was).=
  So, perhaps Adkins called Price with an agenda in mind, which was to take =
advantage of what he realized was a mistake by Enron.

   	Timing here again will be important.  If we coincidentally did not compl=
ete our internal audit until the Appalachian index price rose above the fixe=
d price deal we had with Adkins, then Adkins will argue that ENA opportunist=
ically changed its position on whether there was a deal when the index price=
 rose.  This is exactly, of course, our position with regard to Adkins.  Sta=
cy will be researching the gas prices during the relevant time frame.

	You should also know that Adkins has reportedly done this in the past to ou=
r other Appalachian gas trader, Jim Javens.  John learned about this after t=
he fact.  I will be following up with Javens.

	The next step is for me to send to Farrell the confirm and any other docume=
ntation I want him to see, and follow-up with Farrell to attempt to narrow t=
he fact issues. =20

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt
