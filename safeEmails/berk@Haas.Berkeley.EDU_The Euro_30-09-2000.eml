Today's newspapers are carrying the story of the Danish rejecting the euro.
At least in the NYT, the thesis is that this has to do with sovereignty.
Does it, or is it really just an economic question?  After all, many
countries tie their currencies to other currencies without giving up
sovereignty.  I would like to spend 5 min on this during this week's class,
so I would like all of you to be familiar with the issues.

For those of you that are not already familiar with this, here are two
sources you can read:
