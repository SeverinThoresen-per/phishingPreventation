Subject:	Black Scholes Model with Eugenio

Hello Warriors,

I had expressed an interest in learning about the Black Scholes model, and E=
ugenio suggested that we get a group of warriors together who would be inter=
ested in learning about Black Scholes -- as it is fundamental to understandi=
ng derivatives.  If you are interested, please email me and schedules permit=
ting, we can schedule a session this afternoon.=20
