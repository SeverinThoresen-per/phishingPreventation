 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my=20
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.

     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the=
=20
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as =20
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little=20
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that=20
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th. =20
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It=20
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impac=

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running=20
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders an=

schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.
