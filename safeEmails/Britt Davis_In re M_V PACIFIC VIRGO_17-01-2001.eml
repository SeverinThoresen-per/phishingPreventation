Richard,

This follows up on my telephone conference with you of a moment ago.  This=20
case has taken a significant turn for the worse from ECT's standpoint.

As you know, we began the joint testing of the product samples in the U.K.=20
this week.  The testing began with the loadport samples, which are the most=20
critical. We concentrated on the filterable dirt spec, an area in which we=20
believed we had the best chance of proving our case.  However, the tests=20
showed that the loadport samples are considerably off spec for filterable=20
dirt.  You may recall that SGS had found the loadport samples on spec in all=
=20
respects.  The results of the joint testing reportedly caught all the=20
chemists in attendance by surprise.

As will not surprise you, the chemists present for Mitsubishi and our cargo=20
underwriters gave the impression that they felt no further testing was=20
necessary under the circumstances.

There are three possible explanations that we are considering regarding the=20
difference between SGS's results at loadport and the results during the join=
t=20
testing this week:

1.  SGS's results are not credible (unfortunately, this would tend to be=20
supported by the pre-sale analysis by ECT of the same or similar product=20
that, if my memory is correct, was somewhat off spec for filterable dirt);

2.  the age of the samples (which were taken mid-year last year) may be a=20
factor; and=20

3.  the "bug" earlier reported by SGS, if it exists, may be a factor.

I have spoken this morning about further strategy with David Best and Jim=20
Studdert.  We agreed that Steve Jones, our chemist, would suggest a hiatus i=
n=20
the testing, giving him time to send us a written report on his findings.  I=
t=20
would also give him time to hopefully liaise with Paul Henking and have Paul=
=20
arrange an interview with the SGS surveyor who suggested that the cargo migh=
t=20
have a "bug" in it.  Given the lack of specs in the contract with the=20
supplier, it appears to me that we would have to find something significantl=
y=20
wrong with the product that falls outside even the very loose "Elang Crude,=20
fit for export purposes" language in order to have some cause of action=20
against the supplier.

Jim will contact our cargo underwriters and obtain a preliminary impression=20
from them on how they see the case at this time.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

P.S.--Paul, I would appreciate it if you could call David Best tomorrow and=20
get the ball rolling on the "bug" issue.  Please don't put anything in=20
writing about this issue for Steve Jones yet.
