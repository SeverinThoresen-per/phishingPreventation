Thanks for the red-line version.  Here are my comments:

=A3 In paragraph 10.1, a triggering event would allow close out netting of a=
ll=20
transactions under this agreement and any other agreements between the=20
parties.  And then in paragraph 10.4, it retiturates this point and expands=20
on it by bringing in all amounts owed by all affiliates of both parties. =20
This is pretty vague.  Historically, only amounts owed by the defaulting=20
party to that of the non-defaulting party and its affiliates have been=20
included.  Can we combine the effect of this within a single paragraph.  Tha=
t=20
way, we're not speaking of the same issue within two different sections.
=A3 In paragraph 10.1, cross-default seems a bit vague.  What I was trying t=
o=20
say was, "If any indebtedness in excess of $50MM and $100MM, resepctively=20
have become or is capable of becoming accelerated" and then expressly define=
=20
indebtedness to include all borrowed monies, accounts payable, and financial=
=20
deriviative transactions.  Without expansion, i believe indebtedness is=20
typically meant to include only bank debt.
=A3 If we made them reference Utilicorp United, Inc. as a specified entity,=20
then we could tie all terms, conditions, and support back to them=20
indirectly.  Could we take a look at amending the contract to accomplish=20
this.  It would really strengthen the contract.
=A3 I am surprised they did not tie any guaranty support from Enron Corp. to=
=20
this contract.  They missed this one.
=A3 I am ok with the 2 day LC turn around under a triggering event, although=
 I=20
do not like item c - "be unable to pay its debts as they fall due" - I would=
=20
like to strike this line.

thats it.

I am available for a confernce call should they desire to speak on this=20
further.

thanks
brant

Do you have a redline version of our initial contract to them?  I never saw=20

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the=20
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm an=
d=20
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48=20
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the=20
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral=20
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these=20
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.=20
