As you know, USE is agent for a number of small Carlton sourcers.  They have=
 contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE=
's clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper's Carlton obligation gas in on =
the shippers' individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to co=
nfirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE a=
sked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate th=
e gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlt=
on gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they a=
re agent.

I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal ob=
stacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contract
can only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.

I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would se=
em to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE's supplier would=
 nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from t=
he Admin contract to its clients' individual firm contracts. =20

Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could wo=
rk something out.

Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special =
scheduling logic in TMS,=20
it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US E=
nergy's request.
With the current work load, Gerry didn't think IT could get the changes made=
 by November 1=20
but may have something in place for December.

Should we pursue?
