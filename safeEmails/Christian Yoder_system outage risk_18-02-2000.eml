Mark,
One of the current priorities of  Casino Willamette  is our Services Desk, a=
=20
relatively new concept whereby we supposedly do a bunch of California=20
scheduling coordination services for customers who are too unsophisticated t=
o=20
deal with California complexity,  earn a reasonable little fee and, here is=20
the kicker,  the whole enterprise is seen as involving "very little risk." =20
It is seen as picking up a fair bit of change off the floor with no risk,  =20
as though a slot machine broke and a bunch of quarters rolled around on the=20
floor and all we have to do is scrape them up.  Not big money, but safe=20
money.  "Pays the overhead," one often hears traders remark. =20

I have drafted a series of confirms over last year to document a variety of=20
transactions and am in the process of reviewing them with an eye to constant=
=20
improvement.  I am having a series of discussions with traders, schedulers=20
and settlement folks and one risk that keeps coming up in their minds, which=
=20
I am not really sure I have covered in our documents is referred to as=20
"system outage risk."   Interaction with the Cal PX and the California ISO i=
s=20
all online electronic.  Scheduling power into the California market is all a=
n=20
online business.  So let us say that one bright spring morning we have agree=
d=20
with our 17 SC customers to schedule a variety of power products into and ou=
t=20
of the California system, and right at the critical moment when all of this=20
scheduling stuff is supposed to click, the whole damn system collapses? =20
Apparently we have a bunch of system apparatus that is our own,  that is, it=
=20
is not just our link up to the California entities.  One time our  tie line=20
got cut (middle of night, no problem because they got it fixed in time)  Is=20
this kind of internal system breakdown an event of force majeure,  or is it =
a=20
default on our part?  I have been reading our eol agreements, in particular,=
=20
the ETA and am not sure how to address it.  Is it appropriate in the new age=
=20
electronic commerce world for a party providing electronically based =20
services to just tell everybody that if our system goes down we are not=20
liable and by the way, if it causes a bunch of costs to come flowing back=20
from the ISO,  the other poor guy has to pay them?  I would appreciate your=20
thoughts, based on your eol experience.  ----cgy =20
