Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority d=
uring Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 200=
1, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the s=
ame types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is an=
ything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.
Reyna

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the cha=
nges.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this =
change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October. =
 If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Gerry/Legale,

Would you be able to update us on the status of the SBA priority during Allo=
cations?  September 1st has rolled around really fast.

Thanks,
Reyna

Reyna,  this is to confirm that the SBA-TI's should be scheduled after prima=
ry but before all other nominations.  sjk

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocati=
on.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of maki=
ng the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA=
 activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Pr=
imary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from=
 the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  T=
hanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and receive=
d the green light to go forward, but I will confirm.=20

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring=
 of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS=
 and TMS will be involved in the effort.

	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation=
 on the enhancement
	     list.  I like the idea of automating the last bullet.  I am not sure i=
f it is in CMS or elsewhere, but
	     I would like to be sure we pursue this automation.
	Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
Below is a list of issues that were raised at the meeting held w/ Gerry and =
Reyna (attended by John and I) ......As far as I know, we haven't yet heard =
back from Sue regarding the issues raised.

=2E...Immediately below is LT's response to adding a "hook" in CMS that woul=
d distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements....

More as it develops!=20

I don't have a problem adding a subtype on the IT's of SBA.  I'm not sure I =

Sue,=20
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during alloc=
ations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misun=
derstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still w=
ant them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is n=
o, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have=
 priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should =
only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previ=
ous day might get "squeezed" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SB=
A shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interru=
ptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a "point", they d=
on't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have =
to be identified through the contracts department as "SBA IT"?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contrac=
t system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account ba=
lance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this=
 criteria?
