This is just FYI-

I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to=20
map the market area points accurately.  (What I mean is making sure each=20
location has the proper valuation attached to it in Sitara.)  Just so you=20
know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85=20
tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l.  I know that=
=20
we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this=
=20
is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each=20
location in the market area are accurate.  I would just go ahead and do this=
,=20
but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough.  Ther=
e=20
are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool v=
s=20
TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting=20
the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money=
=20
and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge o=
n=20
CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)

Anyway, I know the market area is a bit more difficult because of valuation=20
issues, but I have to believe we could do better than 19 out of 85.  (And on=
=20
some pipes, like Tennessee, the ration is 0/33).

I know this is a pain to fix, but one day I do envision that we will have=20
automatic notification of capacity being in or out of the money, but that=20
will be meaningless if we are not set up to value points properly.
