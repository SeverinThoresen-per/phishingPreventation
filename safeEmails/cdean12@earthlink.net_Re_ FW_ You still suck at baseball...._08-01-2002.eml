Ollie,

Congrats on hooking up with a little long-term action.  Always thought you'd=
 be one of the first to go.  Send her down south to Portland if it looks lik=
e she's getting board with your "itsy bitsy".

I've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time ca=
n just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I th=
ought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have sc=
ores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn'=
t seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a =
Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls a=
round and shrugging it off as "boring". =20

You may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking for=
ward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fis=
cad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers cr=
ossed.

I'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should m=
eet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy. =20
