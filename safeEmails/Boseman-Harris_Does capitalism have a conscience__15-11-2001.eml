I heard your decision on channel 13 this morning as I was dressing for work.=
 I was not moved by your gesture to give your contractual monetary provision=
s back to the company who would be Dynegy when this is all said and done. If=
 you are sincere about wanting to help Enron, then helping the people who ha=
ve made Enron what it is today would be a  more appropriate gesture. Clearly=
 you know that Dynegy's employees will be given higher consideration for job=
s than Enron employees will. The company will be dismantled and so will our =
lives.

The road to Enron was not an easy one, and  my  decision to seek employment =
here was difficult in light of the way Enron is portrayed in the back office=
s of the energy industry.  Enron is said to be a sweatshop, a backstabbing w=
ork environment and that the executive levels of management at Enron fuel, f=
oster and support this type of mentality. I have worked in various commercia=
l capacities, and I came to Enron with the hope  that times had changed, and=
  that the thriving energy industry had taken Enron to another stratosphere,=
 and I was right! I love my job because the work environment is conducive to=
 a mature and intelligent exchange of information and growth potential.=20

Just when you believe you are among the most intelligent, there is always so=
meone who comes along with more real world application, with common sense an=
d integrity added. Hiring intelligent people is a great practice, but I've w=
orked with the best and the brightest in many companies so Enron is no excep=
tion. Hiring the best and the brightest obviously was the downside to Enron'=
s demise. It appears  that there is a thin line between intelligence and arr=
ogance and Enron appears to have stepped over that line. =20

Due to what you called "mistakes in judgement'", my future here is uncertain=
, as is that of my my co-workers. Many are agonizing about their families fu=
tures as well. I have survived a corporate merger, bankruptcy and buyouts wi=
th a number of companies specifically, Texaco, Columbia Energy Group and Amo=
co.  During all of this I continued to hold my head high and to provide the =
same level of service during these transitions, so that at the end of the da=
y my self esteem and integrity would be intact.=20

Yes, we can and will all find other jobs, just as the many other recently un=
employed people in this hurting economy will.  Everyone speaks to the loss o=
f investor confidence, class action lawsuits and corporate losses, but who s=
peaks out for the employees affected by the actions of a few. We were robbed=
 of our hope, and the expectation of doing a good job and reaping the benefi=
ts. The investors and the employees here were kept in the dark, and  the pow=
ers that be have just sold us down the river and for what? For a handful of =
people to get richer.=20

Rationalizing and trying to bargain the behavior of those who are at fault f=
or this catastrophe is just wrong. Taking it to a level where you somehow co=
nvince yourself that everything that has happened to date is okay, is just w=
rong. Companies merge, are bought out and collapse every day due to mismanag=
ement, industry nose dives and economic slow downs. But please tell me how a=
 company in just a few weeks, can go from a powerhouse to a beggar on the st=
reets of downtown Houston?


Truthfully,

Not just merely a whiner, but a long suffering Gas Industry Specialist.=20
