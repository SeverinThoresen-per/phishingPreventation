Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley du=
ring the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to =
give me a call at 713-853-6401.

IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to "salt" jobs down there in Florid=
a.

The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manage=
r to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take=
 notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisor=
s, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We sh=
ould keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.

Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a =
very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site l=
ead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  Tha=
t way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no oblig=
ation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonist=
ic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing th=
e project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not si=
gn a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our =
hiring process or plans.

We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the tim=
e we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We s=
hould inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will b=
e at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state=
 employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because =
we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.

There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is si=
gned.

Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who wi=
ll control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How d=
o we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting int=
o our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side =
of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building sit=
e.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and t=
hen look at the gating situation.

Back to Mark's suggestions:

Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionis=
t or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be dir=
ected to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer =
questions about hiring plans.  E.g., "Are you hiring electricians out there?=
"  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people sho=
uld know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  The=
y should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a scr=
ipt for the receptionist for such inquiries.

Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consis=
tently.

Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employe=
es are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and oth=
er issues.

One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union har=
mony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.

David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which =
local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.
