Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastat=
e matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is gene=
rally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan,=
 and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused=
 to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC appro=
val.=20

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (d=
raft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passth=
rough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin di=
scussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest=
 we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDC=
s.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to i=
mprove infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  W=
e want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and ca=
n develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).
