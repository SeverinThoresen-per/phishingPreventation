John:

The following is a quick update on the actions that we have taken with El Pa=
so:

Nov. 19 - I met with El Paso's commercial team giving them a full briefing o=
n the project.  During the meeting we signed a confidentiality agreement and=
 I delivered to them a full data-room disk with approximately 80 project doc=
uments.

Nov. 21 - We delivered a follow-up email with two additional documents compl=
eted in the interim.  We scheduled a site visit for Nov. 28th for the date r=
equested by El Paso.

Nov. 26 - We delivered all additional information requested by El Paso in pr=
eparation for their site visit.

We are currently awaiting further requests from El Paso to schedule further =
conference calls to address specific issues.  These will be scheduled immedi=
ately upon their request.

Please let me know if you hear anything from Greg Bafalis.

Thanks,
Brett
