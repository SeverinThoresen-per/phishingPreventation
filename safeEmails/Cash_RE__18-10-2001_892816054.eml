I know, but that doesn't change the fact that we should articulate the stand=
ards that we are using -- I know that they use some criteria that are based =
on solid business reasons, so let's capture them!  That way, we at least can=
 explain why we did things.  Michelle

I like that there is some sort of formal process based on peer group. =20
=20
I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial=
 groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not fo=
r compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough cor=
relation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determinin=
g the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's spe=
cify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that=
 decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing betw=
een persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
=20
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, =
will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
=20
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If=
 so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to=
 explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
=20
Promotion process looks good.
=20
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bon=
us amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.=
  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as a=
bove.  I
=20
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit p=
lans.
=20
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk t=
hrough pay criteria.

Here is our plan on PRC.=20

Assistants:=20

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings.=
=20

Non Commercial but in North America:=20

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay gri=
d determined by OOC.=20

Analysts and Associates=20

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC=20
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide f=
or a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the t=
op one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors=20

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are goin=
g to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on=
 this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetin=
gss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).=
  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and w=
ork with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate com=
pensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criter=
ia.=20

VP's=20

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - so=
me VP's and some MD's. =20
This too will be directly related to pay.=20

Cheers as you Brits say=20
