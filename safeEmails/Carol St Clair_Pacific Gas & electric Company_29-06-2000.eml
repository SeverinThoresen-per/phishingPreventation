Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concern=
s=20
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add=20
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is=20
considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the=20
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a=20
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of =
a=20
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers=20
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a=20
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel=20
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I=20
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" ru=
n=20
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept =
a=20
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product=
=20
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana=20
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the=20
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper tim=
e=20
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.=20
