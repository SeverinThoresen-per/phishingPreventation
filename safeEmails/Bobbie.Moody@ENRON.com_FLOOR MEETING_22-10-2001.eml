At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey =
conducted a "group conversation" in which he discussed several topics that h=
e knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the grou=
p on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, =
with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The atte=
ndees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick h=
as scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is l=
imited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If=
 more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule a=
n additional meeting(s).  (You will receive a confirmation or a notice that =
you will be given another opportunity to attend a future meeting.)  Preferen=
ce will be given to those who did not attend the Global Accounting Leadershi=
p Conference, which means that few of the Senior Directors or above will be =
at the meeting if there is a sizeable response.

In addition, while Rick will be happy to take questions at the discussion, f=
eel free to submit questions in advance to Bobbie, to Melissa Becker (VP Hum=
an Capital Management for Global Accounting), or directly to Rick.  Question=
s directed to Melissa or Bobbie will be compiled and sent without names to R=
ick.  Alternatively, you may deliver your questions in an envelope to Bobbie=
 (EB1747), Melissa (EB1769) or Rick (EB5023).  All topics are fair game.
