Morris,=20

Just wanted to give you an update on the electrical supply for the ENA/Hubba=
rd Agreement.  I spoke with Bill Rapp and he informed me that at this point =
we can not negotiate a backup contract with Midland Power until ENA terminat=
es their agreement.  Bill prepared a letter to send Midland Power covering t=
he bankruptcy which Midland Power now has in their hands. =20

I also spoke with Charlie Gramm and Mark Knippa.  Mark stated that ENA is in=
 the process of getting the past due bills current and wish to continue prov=
iding electrical power for the compression.  Mark said this payment should h=
appen in the next couple of days.  Mark did talk to Midland Power last week =
and explained the situation and felt confident that they would not shut off =
power.  Mark also stated that by contract that if ENA can not meet their obl=
igations that gives NNG that right to purchase power directly from Midland P=
ower.  Mark indicated at this point ENA wants to continue with the contract.

Charlie spoke with Midland Power today and was assured that they would not c=
ut off power prior to Dec. 15th and being that the 15th was on a weekend tha=
t they would not shut off power over the weekend.  Charlie stated that the i=
ndividual he talked with at Midland Power wanted to review some information =
that he had just received and that they would touch base later today or no l=
ater than in the morning.

To sum it all up we should have power to at least Monday and should have som=
e additional information later today or early tomorrow on the long term solu=
tion.

I will keep you updated and let me know if you have any questions.=20

Thanks=20
