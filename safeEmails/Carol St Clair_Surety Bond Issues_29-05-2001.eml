Below is a summary of the surety bond issues that I believe we need to=20
resolve in order to feel comfortable accepting it as a form of collateral to=
=20
secure a counterparty's obligations with respect to physical power purchase=20
and sale transactions:

1.  Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a=20
surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in=20
violation of the appleton statute.  What type of legal comfort should we=20
receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was=20
validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?

2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the=20
issuer.

3. In the form of bond that we were given, the "Now Therefore" language in=20
the third paragraph is not acceptable.  Determine what can be said in its=20
place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by=20
the Confirmation.

4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of=
=20
Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that th=
e=20
bond references.  The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more=20
generically to accommodate this.=20

5. Does credit need a "pre-bankruptcy" trigger that would require Reliant to=
=20
convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?  If so, what=20
would this trigger be?

Let me know if you have any additional issues.  I will be discussing some of=
=20
these with our outside counsel shortly.    =20
