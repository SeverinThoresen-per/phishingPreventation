Market manipulator. Poster child for California's energy woes. Member of the=
 Texas cabal shaking down West Coast consumers. As the Golden State's energy=
 debacle picked up speed this spring, El Paso Corp. suddenly found itself ca=
st in the role of Public Enemy No. 1. State and federal regulators are inves=
tigating charges that El Paso used its control of a key pipeline to sharply =
boost the price of natural gas flowing into the state. El Paso says it certa=
inly didn't manipulate the market and blames higher prices on California's u=
nique energy problems. Still, investors have reacted to the possibility of m=
illions of dollars in fines--and now quickly falling natural gas prices--by =
knocking the company's stock down 33% this year.=20
All the headlines about legal troubles, however, are obscuring how well hard=
-charging Chief Executive William A. Wise, 56, has positioned El Paso in the=
 rapidly mutating energy business. Ironically, El Paso was left holding the =
excess California pipeline capacity only because a big customer had decided =
in 1995 to dump it. That blow nearly sank El Paso and sent Wise off on a div=
ersification strategy that has taken the company from a sleepy little region=
al outfit to one of the biggest players in the energy bonanza. Houston-based=
 El Paso grew from $2.9 billion in revenues in 1995 to $21.9 billion in 2000=
, and will pass $50 billion this year. Its earnings of $652 million last yea=
r reversed a $255 million loss the year before.
In the process, El Paso has become North America's largest pipeline company =
and the nation's fourth-largest energy outfit, with a hand in everything fro=
m natural gas exploration and production, to wholesale power and gas trading=
, to power generation. It is also pushing to become a major player in the gr=
owing market for liquefied natural gas. On July 25, El Paso reported a 40% i=
ncrease in second-quarter income, to $413 million, on sales of $13.4 billion=
=2E The stock price, however, remains in the doldrums, hovering around $48 a=
 share. Falling prices have hurt much of the sector: Rival Enron Corp. is of=
f 48% this year while Dynegy Inc. is down 23%.=20
Even if the company is forced to cough up a big fine--and no one is speculat=
ing how big that fine could be--many analysts and investors doubt that will =
crimp Wise's diversification push. ``El Paso is the biggest and best-positio=
ned [company] to take advantage of the nation's natural gas supply crunch,''=
 says Donald Coxe, chairman of Harris Investment Management Inc. in Chicago,=
 which owns El Paso shares.=20
Wise really had no choice but to branch out. In the mid-'90s, Pacific Gas & =
Electric Corp. and other utilities were paying millions of dollars for capac=
ity they couldn't use because overbuilding had led to a huge pipeline glut. =
With the blessing of friendly state regulators, PG&E and others gave up thei=
r pipeline rights, with PG&E returning 1.14 billion cubic feet a day of capa=
city to El Paso. In one stroke, that erased $125 million of El Paso's annual=
 revenue. FRUGALITY AND LUCK. Wise worked quickly to put El Paso back on a f=
irm footing. He slashed $100 million in costs, in part by laying off more th=
an a third of El Paso's employees, freezing executives' pay, and taking no s=
alary himself for three years. He also negotiated a $60 million settlement w=
ith PG&E and the other utilities for dumping the capacity. By last year, the=
 situation had shifted 180 degrees. As demand jumped and California faced sk=
yrocketing energy costs, that same pipeline space had become a precious comm=
odity. And El Paso was in the driver's seat as the state's largest gas suppl=
ier. ``That's what's so ironic now. The capacity that everybody's complainin=
g about in California was basically the capacity that PG&E gave back,'' says=
 H. Brent Austin, El Paso's chief financial officer.=20
More important, Wise, who declined to be interviewed, set out on an aggressi=
ve new strategy to diversify away from California--which had delivered 75% o=
f El Paso's revenues before 1996. Wise had spent his entire career at El Pas=
o, joining in 1970 out of the University of Colorado School of Law and takin=
g over the CEO's post in 1990. His shopping spree began in 1996 when he scoo=
ped up Tenneco Inc.'s pipeline business. The $4 billion deal tripled El Paso=
's size and gave it the only coast-to-coast natural gas pipeline. In all, Wi=
se has snapped up some $35 billion worth of acquisitions in five years, incl=
uding his biggest, the $24 billion purchase in January of Coastal Corp. That=
 substantially boosted El Paso's exploration and production operations, expa=
nded its capacity to some 60,000 miles of pipeline nationwide, and added oil=
 refining to the company's mix. Along the way, El Paso also has bought inter=
ests in some 44 natural gas-fired power plants across the country. BALANCE O=
F POWER. Today, such nonregulated businesses as natural gas marketing and tr=
ading operations, exploration and production, and the power plants account f=
or more than 60% of El Paso's earnings before interest and taxes, vs. 8% in =
1996. Analysts say the new El Paso's ``wellhead-to-wire'' operations give it=
 a big advantage over Enron, Dynegy, and other competitors at a time when th=
e power industry is rapidly changing and clean-burning natural gas is growin=
g in popularity. Meanwhile, its wide-reaching stable of assets means it does=
n't have to rely on high natural gas prices, which have dropped roughly 70% =
nationwide since the beginning of the year.=20
But it's that very mutifaceted structure that may have landed El Paso in hot=
 water in California. State regulators allege that the company's pipeline un=
it, El Paso Natural Gas, rigged a pipeline-capacity auction last year in fav=
or of its energy-marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy Group. Regulat=
ors charge that the two wholly owned units passed secret information between=
 them that helped the merchant group's bid. Federal hearings on this charge =
are to begin on Aug. 2. Ralph Eads III, the merchant group's president, coun=
ters that ``the pipeline [unit] didn't have any say-so over whose bid it too=
k, it just said whose bid was the highest. Our bid was the highest. There ar=
e [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] rules that govern the behavior betw=
een our pipeline and our marketing affiliate. And we are very scrupulous in =
observing those rules.''=20
In their second allegation, authorities claim that the company withheld pipe=
line capacity into California to jack up prices illegally; a judge's ruling =
is expected in October. Regulators note that spot prices for natural gas in =
Southern California spiked to more than double national spot rates. ``A big =
reason for the increase in consumers' electricity bills is because El Paso m=
anipulated prices at the California border,'' alleges Harvey Y. Morris, the =
state utilities commission attorney arguing the case before FERC.=20
Eads denies El Paso withheld capacity. Instead, the company blames the runup=
 in natural gas prices in Southern California on an unusually hot summer las=
t year and a cold winter this year, low reserves, rising electricity demand,=
 and a now-inadequate pipeline system into the state. In any case, Eads says=
, El Paso didn't fully benefit from rising prices because the merchant group=
 shipped 95% of its gas under fixed-price contracts as a hedge against a pos=
sible price drop. ``As prices went up, we lost money,'' says Eads. ``If we w=
ere smart enough to manipulate the market, we would have been smart enough n=
ot to have hedged.''=20
Maybe so. Either way, given the company's smart transformation over the past=
 five years, El Paso seems well-prepared to ride out whatever twists Califor=
nia has in store for it.

We are committed to India. We are not in any discussion right now on selling=
 the plant... -- Kenneth Lay, Chairman, Enron, after the companys annual mee=
ting in Houston on May 2, 2001.=20
BARELY a couple of months after pledging the company`s commitment towards In=
dia when Kenneth Lay last week expressed Enrons desire to get out of the tro=
ubled Dabhol Power Company.
But it evoked hardly any reaction in Maharashtra or among industry watchers =
as Enron International had already announced its corporate strategy of wanti=
ng to pull out of developing countries and Lays statement that it wants to l=
eave the Konkan coast was seen as a yet another move by the company to bully=
 the government.=20
So a combative union power minister Suresh Prabhu retorted that ``Enron is n=
ot the only US company operating in India.=20
There are at least six other US companies currently operating in the power s=
ector in India. Although AES has recently expressed reservations about opera=
tions in Orissa it wants to invest in other states.=20
Enron watchers are of the view that it is difficult for MSEB and the US ener=
gy major to get rid of each other. Enron has 20-year contracts for 2.1m tonn=
es a year of LNG for use in its power plant, with Oman LNG and Abu Dhabi Gas=
 Liquefaction Company, and Lay admitted that Enron might prefer to seek othe=
r buyers.=20
And its been getting increasingly difficult for the company to launch into y=
et another round of tiring renegotiations with the state government, an exer=
cise it has done twice in the past.=20
However, the most crucial question is: Where are the buyers? The Maharashtra=
 government has tried to pose the entire controversy as an issue which can b=
e solved only if the centre steps in either by bailing it out or by allowing=
 a central power utility like NTPC to buy it.=20
If Enron prefers to pack up, the state has already steered clear of its resp=
onsibility of finding a new buyer.=20
The states energy minister Padmasinh Patils view that Enrons departure ``wil=
l be Gods biggest blessing for us, underlines the states intransigent stance=
=2E=20
However, Madhav Godbole, the man who is heading the Enron renegotiation pane=
l, when asked to comment, was realistic in judging the situation. Realising =
Enrons game plan Mr Godbole indicated that ``the next meeting (of the renego=
tiating committee) will not be necessary now.=20
He knew that if Enron were really serious about its withdrawal plan it would=
 stay away from the next meeting. And if it really did so, the job of the co=
mmittee becomes much easier.=20
Vinay Bansal, chairman MSEB, who single handedly brought the US energy major=
 to its knees, was cautious in his reaction.=20
``Since we have rescinded the PPA with Enron, we have no locus standi on thi=
s issue, he said. However, is MSEB interested in buying out Enrons state in =
the project? And does MSEB have the required financial muscle to buy out Enr=
ons equity. ``Its too early to react, said Bansal.=20
The Godbole committee will be meeting soon internally to decide the future c=
ourse of action, Godbole said. Vinay Mohan Lal, the states energy secretary =
hinted that considering the Enrons desire, the state might submit an interim=
 report.=20
What it means is that if the company sticks to its stand on the issue, the c=
ommittee may release its report unilaterally, obviously blaming the company =
for the failure of the talks.=20
Godbole said the committee, which has been set up to renegotiate the PPA sig=
ned between the US energy major and MSEB would have to review the entire sit=
uation after DPC made a public announcement about its desire to exit and sel=
l the plant to the union government or the lenders.=20
Enron had said that the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute betw=
een DPC and MSEB was to sell its entire stake in the project to the centre o=
r the lenders and that any sale would need to be on terms of providing compl=
ete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures.=20
The Centre has asked FIs led by the IDBI to work out a package in this regar=
d. The package is to be submitted to a committee chaired by the finance secr=
etary Ajit Kumar.=20
However, the centre has ruled out any possibility at this stage of a buyout =
by a central utility. In fact Prabhu said, ``We are not going to allow a com=
pany like NTPC or PTC to buy out such equity. The state government and Enron=
 have to try and resolve their issue.=20
According to Patil, power ministers of four states have evinced interest in =
purchasing power generated from DPC, provided the tariff per unit was below =
Rs 2.50.=20
Madhya Pradesh was willing to buy 100 mw, Karnataka 300 mw, Delhi 150 mw and=
 Haryana 100 mw. The state was not in a position to absorb power from phase =
II of the project and there was an urgent need for the centre to intervene i=
n the project.
