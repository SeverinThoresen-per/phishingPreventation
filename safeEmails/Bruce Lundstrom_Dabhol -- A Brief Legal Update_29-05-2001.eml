Gentlemen --

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance=20
testing, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will=20
draw no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing=20
availability declarations.  These letters turn the vague "recission" letter=20
that we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy=20
Regulatory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position=
=20
seems to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC=20
is the appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship=20
(e.g., determine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the=20
misdeclaration claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction=
=20
in this matter and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping=20
any arbitration proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a=20
petition tor the Bombay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy=20
power from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and=20
GOM) that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no=20
reasonable hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Bruce
