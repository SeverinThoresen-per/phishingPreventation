Jeremy,
In the last few months our intramonth books have seen very large swings in=20
their P&L due simply to currency positions.  The traders want to be able to=20
hedge this risk but the problem is that there are no reports in ERMS that=20
meet their currency information requirements.

We need reports similar to those reports which we are able to produce for ou=
r=20
term books

Crv Shift (Implicit)  - to show price curve shift by pub code
Curr Hedge   - to show currency curveshift by month
Implicit Position Report  - to show gas and USD positions by month
Top Page Canada  - to correctly bucket price curveshift verses currency=20
curveshift

We need these reports to work for all of our intramonth books (physical,=20
financial, gas daily). =20

physical postids:  accued: 698871, MTM: 698872
financial postid:     698876
gas daily:   698877


All of these reports currently work for our term books (698669) but none of=20
our intramonth books (there reports come out blank)

This issue  is of CRITICAL importance to us - our IM book is seeing=20
SIGNIFICANT swings in p&l due to currency exposure.  We had originally asked=
=20
for currency reports from you approx 6 months ago (requested by Walt).  We=20
now need this ASAP.

The most important IM book which we need reports for is the IM financial boo=
k=20
and the most important report we need in the Implicit Position Report.
I understand that this will take a considerable amout of your time but this=20
is VERY important to the profitability of Enron Canada.  Please call be to=20
dicuss a timeline. =20
