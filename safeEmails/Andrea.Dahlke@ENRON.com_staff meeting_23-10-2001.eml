Stacey-

I have a lunch meeting for DHA on Thursday that I committed to be at (and ha=
ve a report to give).  I definitely do not want to cause problems by not bei=
ng at this staff meeting that was called for Thursday though.  Would you lik=
e me to find someone to take my place at the DHA meeting?

Thanks!

Andrea
