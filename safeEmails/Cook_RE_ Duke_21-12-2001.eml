Ladies

Did an English lawyer work on this?  If such a global netting agreement exis=
ts, could I trouble you for a copy?

Many thanks and Season's Greetings.

Paul,

I've heard a rumour that there's a Global Netting Agreement for Duke.  Is th=
ere any way you can find this out?  They owe us, the gas guys and the contin=
ental guys money, but we apparently owe them loads in the states.

Neil.
