Susan, I was hoping that you could help me locate copies of contracts (see n=
umbers 3, 4, 5, and 8) listed on the attached document.  Maybe you could poi=
nt me in the right direction if you know where I might find copies if you do=
n't have.  Please advise asap as I need to provide to auditors.  Thanks, Deb
