James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I=20
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either. =20

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and=20
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the=
=20
contract:

MDQ =3D 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and=20
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for=20
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November -=20
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.
