Subject: FWD: Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

How true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that
men should take a look at their beer consumption,
considering the results of a recent analysis that
revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The
theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into
women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer
each.  It was then observed that 100% of the men
gained weight, talked excessively without making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed
to think rationally, argued over nothing,
and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.
