Mary and I met with Mary Kay regarding the filing for mandatory cash-out at =
constrained points.  Assuming the historical data will support and demonstra=
te an operational need, she is on board with this approach.  gh

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our c=
urrent position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are c=
oncerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up se=
gmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed a=
gain the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "w=
ish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing w=
ould just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly define=
d, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out i=
n constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which =
we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocat=
ion and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing =
for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 6=
37 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are=
 going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on =
our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & chec=
k with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased im=
balance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hol=
d meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues o=
f the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have=
 ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.
