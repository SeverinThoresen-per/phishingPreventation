Teresa:
As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about=
=20
the maternity leave policy:

1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up=20
at 100% pay.

2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would=20
need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists an=
d=20
justifying sick leave pay at 90%

3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence,=20
whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current=20
benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I a=
m=20
on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I=20
still eligible?

I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let m=
e=20
know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am=20
scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my=20
plans. =20
