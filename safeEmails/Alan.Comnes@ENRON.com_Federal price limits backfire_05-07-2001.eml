Federal price limits backfire=20
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps=20

Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal reg=
ulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed=
 limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blacko=
uts in the two states.=20

The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blacko=
uts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts =
in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce a=
ir conditioning.=20

The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a=
 closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisio=
ns that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shor=
tages.=20

"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for th=
e California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of do=
llars to keep the state's lights on.=20

"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.=20

The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet p=
ower companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates=
 during periods of high demand.=20

Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the exp=
ense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity=
 must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20

"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said =
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an ene=
rgy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20

Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was n=
o economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price contro=
ls are in effect.=20

"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not=
 having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20


BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when p=
ower reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert abou=
t an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20

"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a=
 spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees =
the state's power network.=20

The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after =
Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting h=
eavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their light=
s.=20

Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that=
 the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they=
 are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in=
 exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20

"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potentia=
l for unintended consequences."=20

Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less-=
 efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing,=
 under capped prices.=20

"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20

The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92=
 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because o=
f the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20

Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls hav=
e extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20

"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.=20

'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20

California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith th=
at price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal r=
egulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withho=
ld output.=20

"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," =
said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20

Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue =
that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal reg=
ulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply a=
nd demand determine costs.=20

Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back=
 on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line numb=
er provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergenci=
es.=20

"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."=20

State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the comm=
ission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when=
 the commission might come up with a response.=20
