The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was=
 removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or sc=
heduled volume.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior? =20

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now=
=2E  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduli=
ng and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should=
 not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a =
contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston =
@ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams compan=
y, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibili=
ty for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a =
viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want=
 to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned =
the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to =
happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Jean,

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what=
 interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Thanks, Mike

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John =
Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,50=
0 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant tha=
t mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX. =20

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedg=
ing deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He i=
s concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him =
in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer =
Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the u=
pstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and=
 hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this p=
ossiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757
