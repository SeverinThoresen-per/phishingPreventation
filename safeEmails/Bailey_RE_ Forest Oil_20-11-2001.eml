For the one deal you mentioned, YA8712.1, it was "released" by Darren in Cre=
dit without=20
any credit terms on 10/18.    Regarding the other handwritten deal numbers o=
n that cover page, I=20
believe are older (Aug or earlier) - and I only keep our credit emails a cou=
ple of months, so=20
I don't know who released those - but none of them went out with credit prov=
isions.  =20

I guess you should start with Darren. =20
