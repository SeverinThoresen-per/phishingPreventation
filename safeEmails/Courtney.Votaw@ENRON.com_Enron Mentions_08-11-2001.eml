USA: U.S. stocks slip as Fed rate-cut euphoria fades.
By Elizabeth Lazarowitz

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Stocks slipped on Wednesday, eroding the previou=
s session's sharp gains, as worries about the gloomy economic environment ov=
ershadowed hopes the Federal Reserve's rate cuts can help spur a rebound.=20
"You get these fights with the bulls and the bears," said James Volk, co-dir=
ector of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson & Co. "There are a number of=
 people that are bullish about the economy turning around ... and there's an=
other group that think there's no reason for this buoyancy in the market bec=
ause it's still way, way premature."
The market initially built on Tuesday's rally when the Fed's 10th interest-r=
ate cut this year sent stocks soaring to their highest levels in about two m=
onths. But momentum faded toward the end of Wednesday's session.=20
"We had a big run up yesterday after the Fed announcement," said Peter Cooli=
dge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "The announcement was expect=
ed, but the run-up wasn't, so we're just giving up a little bit of ground on=
 that."=20
The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite, buffeted early in the session by disa=
ppointing results and a discouraging forecast from wireless telecommunicatio=
ns firm Qualcomm Inc., finished with a gain of 2.45 points, or 0.13 percent,=
 at 1,837.53.=20
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 36.75 points, or 0.38 percent, to 9=
,554.37. At its session high of 9,644.12, the blue-chip index had erased all=
 of its post-Sept. 11 losses.=20
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 3.06 points, or 0.27 percent, t=
o 1,115.80.=20
Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. dragged on the Dow after HP and Compaq Compute=
r Corp. stood firm on their plans for a $21 billion merger, even as pressure=
 mounted from Hewlett and Packard family members to cancel the deal.=20
Hewlett shares slipped 63 cents to $19.18. The stock gained more than 17 per=
cent on Tuesday after the founding Hewlett family, which has a stake of more=
 than 5 percent in Hewlett-Packard, said it would vote against the deal. Com=
paq's stock sagged 51 cents to $7.99.=20
Energy trader Enron Corp. was badly beaten yet again, plunging to a 10-year =
low of $7 amid concerns about its ability to raise cash. Late in the day it =
got a boost from a Wall Street Journal report that rival Dynegy Inc. is in t=
alks to infuse about $2 billion into the struggling company. Enron ended dow=
n 62 cents at $9.05.=20
Interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks like J.P. Morgan Chase, up $1.05 at=
 $38.59, and American Express Co., up $1.12 at $31.68, underpinned the blue-=
chip Dow.=20
Stocks have surged in recent weeks as investors put aside their current econ=
omic woes, hopeful that the Fed's rate reductions and a hefty fiscal stimulu=
s package can help the economy spring back by the middle of next year.=20
Investors got encouragement from the latest key economic report, which showe=
d productivity rose more strongly than expected in the third quarter as firm=
s cut workers' hours at the fastest pace in 10 years. The government data su=
ggested companies are adjusting to the slowdown in economic growth.=20
"Any time productivity is up, that's good news for the market," said Robert =
Baur, chief economist for Invista Capital Management, which oversees $24 bil=
lion in equities.=20
Wireless-related stocks were buffeted after Qualcomm, which holds the patent=
 for a popular cellular technology, reported earnings that missed forecasts.=
 It also said profits for the current fiscal year would be at the low end of=
 already reduced estimates, citing the global economic slowdown.=20
Nevertheless, Qualcomm still managed to erase its early loss to gain 38 cent=
s to $55.11. The American-traded shares of Swedish mobile phone giant Ericss=
on slipped 16 cents to $4.73, while the shares of Finnish rival Nokia droppe=
d 86 cents to $22.20.=20
Heavyweights like networking giant Cisco Systems also underpinned the Nasdaq=
 market. Cisco gained 46 cents to $18.93.=20
The market will likely remain rangebound in the very near future as investor=
s search for solid evidence that a recovery is at hand, analysts said.=20
"It's usually a time when traders tend to take their gains, because there's =
nothing left for the short term to look forward to," said A.C. Moore, chief =
investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates.=20
One bright spot was America's No. 1 trash hauler Waste Management Inc., whic=
h posted a net profit, due in part to lower costs and interest expenses, eve=
n after taking a charge to settle the last of a series of class-action lawsu=
its. It jumped $1.63 to $26.98.=20
Shares of Lands' End Inc. were also hot, racing up almost 18 percent, or $6.=
41 to $42.15, after the Internet and catalog retailer posted quarterly resul=

US Power, Gas Companies Restrict Dealings With Enron
By Jon Kamp, Kristen McNamara and Mark Golden

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Trading companies in Enron Corp.'s (ENE) key North Am=
erican power and gas markets are restricting their dealings with the ailing =
Houston-based giant, people at those companies said Wednesday.=20
Concerns have mounted because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of t=
he trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for=
 those commodities on its Internet-based system EnronOnline, has seen its sh=
are price fall by about 75% and its credit ratings downgraded since mid-Octo=
ber due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.
"We've restricted our business with them," said Mike Smith, chief financial =
officer for Mirant Corp. (MIR) unit Mirant Americas Group, a Top 10 trader o=
f power and gas in the U.S.=20
Smith wouldn't be more specific, but his comments echoed those of others in =
the business.=20
"Our exposure to Enron is insignificant compared with the previous exposure,=
" said Al Butkus, spokesman for Aquila Inc. (ILA), a Top 5 U.S. power and ga=
s trader.=20
Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian com=
pany Tractebel S.A., has limited the term of transactions with Enron to thre=
e years or less, a person at the company said. And a power broker said some =
medium-sized western utilities have stopped trading with Enron even for near=
-term delivery.=20
Enron didn't return calls seeking comment.=20
Enron's ability to transact in its core markets - North American wholesale g=
as and power - is essential if the company maintain the earnings and cash fl=
ow needed to emerge from its current credit crisis, Wall Street analysts and=
 ratings agencies have said. Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service=
 downgraded Enron's credit
to within two steps of junk-bond status last week and have it on watch for
further downgrade. Enron still has its supporters. Exelon Corp. (EXC) is
monitoring its own risk management, but hasn't changed its relationship with=
=20
Enron, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Ann M. Gillis said.=20

"We haven't changed our relationship," Gillis said.=20
Enron is a very important factor in the vitality of the wholesale energy mar=
kets, she said. They're still the "largest, best" of the companies out there=
, she said.=20
Likewise, a trading floor manager at one energy company said Enron called ea=
rlier in the week and asked that the company increase its trading on EnronOn=
line. The company's EOL volumes had fallen, but it honored Enron's request o=
ut of respect for Enron's still market-making power.=20
PPL Corp. (PPL), however, moved to mitigate its exposure to Enron following =
the downgrades, said a person in the company's energy marketing operation, P=
PL EnergyPlus LLC.=20
"Enron would not be a first choice to do long-term transactions," the person=
 said. "For shorter-terms, deals, they wouldn't be considered equally with e=
veryone else. There's just too much risk there."=20

IN THE MONEY: The 'D' Word Could Bite Enron. Others Too?
By Carol S. Remond

11/07/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With Enron Corp. (ENE), what you don't see is what co=
uld hurt you.
And that's what has many on Wall Street worried today.=20
Hidden from investors by off-balance sheet transactions are billions of doll=
ars of derivative contracts that Enron has entered into with banks and inves=
tment firms as well as other energy companies. Some are hedging transactions=
 while others are contracts to sell a commodity at a specific price at some =
time in the future.=20
As Enron's credit situation continues to deteriorate, investors are scrambli=
ng to figure out who could be affected by the fallout and how widespread it =
could be. By its own account as of December 2000, Enron was a party in rough=
ly $20 billion of derivative contracts on which it owed its counterparts. Th=
e current size of its total derivative exposure isn't known.=20
Confidence in the company has fallen dramatically. Talk on Wall Street Wedne=
sday is that firms are dumping Enron's bonds as well as its stock. The stock=
 was off almost 25% at one point, in part tied to concerns that some of its =
biggest customers are moving business elsewhere because of Enron's worsening=
 credit quality.=20
This all comes against the backdrop that Enron has been trying to secure an =
up to $2 billion equity infusion. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday=
 afternoon on Dow Jones Newswires that Dynegy Inc. (DYN) was in advanced tal=
ks to infuse that amount into Enron in a deal that could lead to an acquisit=
ion. Enron stock rebounded from its $7 a share low on the report and was off=
 but 5% at $9.20. (Dynegy investors clearly aren't happy about a prospective=
 deal - they knocked the stock down 8%, in part over worries about what Dyne=
gy could be getting itself into.)=20
For an indication of how severely Wall Street views the situation, you need =
to look no further than the derivatives market itself, where the cost of pro=
tecting the business you have done with Enron is skyrocketing and money is b=
eing demanded up front.=20
Traders say companies that today have unhedged forward purchase contracts wi=
th Enron are paying dearly for insurance. Here's how it works: Let's say you=
 are company that has agreed to buy a certain amount of energy from Enron at=
 a fixed price in five years. You pay Enron money up front for that contract=
=2E To hedge yourself against a volatile market, you turn around and buy a f=
inancial futures contract that minimizes your risk.=20
Before the recent problems at Enron, that offsetting financial contract woul=
d cost about 1.5% to 2% of the value of the contract with premiums paid on a=
 quarterly or semi-annual basis. Today, that financial contract will cost 15=
% to 25% in a very illiquid derivatives market. And given the perceived high=
 probability of an Enron default, those willing to sell Enron protection are=
 now demanding to be paid that percentage upfront. (The cost of hedging Enro=
n's credit risk is now close to what some investors paid shortly after the S=
ept. 11 attacks to protect themselves against exposure to airline companies.=
)=20
Another way companies who do business with Enron might look to protect thems=
elves is by curtailing trading activities with Enron. So far, few have been =
willing to admit publicly that they're seriously worried about their credit =
exposure to Enron. But some have begun to address the potential credit risk =
associated to Enron's unraveling.=20
On Wednesday, Apache Corp. said it unwound nearly all of its hedges on gas p=
rices. An Apache spokesman said the unwinding was caused by "concerns about =
ripple effects of Enron's predicaments through the market." The spokesman sa=
id Apache was now looking to unwind one hedging transaction with Enron. Othe=
r companies are said to have cut their exposure to Enron as well.=20
Even if most firms aren't admitting to a net reduction of their transactions=
 with Enron, people familiar with the situation said those companies had now=
 adopted a `neutral" stance, only entering a transaction when they can direc=
tly offset it with other one.=20
Energy companies aren't likely to be the only ones worrying about Enron wors=
ening woes.=20
Giant Wall Street firms active in the $63 trillion worldwide derivative mark=
et could also be on the hook for some of the contracts in which Enron is a c=
ounterpart.=20
Credit derivative contracts and other hedging instruments allow investors to=
 transfer at least some of the credit risk associated with a transaction to =
someone willing to take on that risk, much like an insurance policy.=20
Securities firms are often acting as middlemen, selling protection to one co=
unterpart, while selling offsetting exposure to another. That brings about t=
he so-call counterpart risk.=20
Somewhere, someone is long Enron counterpart risk and if Enron isn't able to=
 pay up on its part of the bargain (at least $20 billion as of Dec. 31, 2000=
), then the middlemen could be left holding the bag.=20
"There is no question that there is Enron risk out there. The question is wh=
ether it's well distributed across the market or whether it's concentrated i=
n a few (derivative) houses," an official at a large derivative house said.=20
According to a report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Chas=
e Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guarantee Trust Company, Bank of America and Citiba=
nk dominated the derivative market in the second quarter, accounting for alm=
ost $43 trillion of the $47.5 trillion in nominal amount of derivative contr=
acts written by and outstanding at U.S. commercial banks. Investment banks l=
ike Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also big players in the derivative =
markets, having issued and outstanding about $5 trillion and $4 trillion res=
pectively at the end of 2000.=20

Enron Corp. Cut to `Sell' at A.G. Edwards

Dynegy in Talks to Buy Enron With ChevronTexaco Cash (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

      Houston, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. is in talks to
buy Enron Corp. as Enron faces a cash crunch and loss of investor
confidence over its dealings with partnerships controlled by a top
executive, people familiar with the situation said.

      ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy,
is considering adding $1.5 billion to the deal to help Enron,
whose stock and credit ratings declined in the wake of a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the
partnerships, the people said.

      The boards of the three companies were meeting today on the
proposed transaction, the people said. Dynegy and Enron, rival
Houston energy trading firms, haven't agreed on a price, the
people said. Dynegy is proposing a stock swap with a modest
premium while Enron is holding out for more, the people said.

     ``If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to
acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid'' such
as overpaying for Enron, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James
Yanello. ``A deal could provide Dynegy with tremendous
opportunity.''

     Dynegy would gain an established wholesale energy business,
the leading energy manager for commercial and small-industrial
customers, and the largest Internet energy trading operation, many
times larger than Dynegy's, he said. Yanello rates Dynegy ``strong
buy'' and doesn't own shares of either company.

     Shares of Dynegy, the fifth-largest U.S. natural gas
marketer, fell $3 to $33. Enron, whose stock has plunged 89
percent this year, fell 62 cents to $9.05 in trading of 111
million shares, almost eight times the daily average for the past
three months. ChevronTexaco shares rose 48 cents to $87.28.

     The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with
about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, one person
said.

                         Partnership Probe

     ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel
also declined to comment.

     ``We would be very surprised if Dynegy buys the whole
company,'' said Tim Ghriskey, president of Ghriskey Capital
Partners, which doesn't own Enron or Dynegy shares.

     ``All the (Dynegy) board has to do is look at what's
happening to their stock price today, and you'd wonder why they
would want to do it in the face of what's happening with the
stock.''

     The talks were previously reported by the Wall Street Journal
and financial news network CNBC.

     Enron also set to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,
Citigroup Inc. and other lenders on Friday to discuss merger plans
and a possible increase on the amount the company pays for
existing credit lines, according to bankers familiar with the
matter.

     The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its
offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial
team, led by its new Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the
people said.

     The SEC is investigating Enron partnerships run by the
company's former chief financial Officer. The entities bought and
sold Enron shares and assets in trades that cost Enron $35
million. The company also lost $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.



Legal Group to Sue Over California Power Contracts (Update1)
2001-11-07 15:39 (New York)

Legal Group to Sue Over California Power Contracts (Update1)

     (Adds background on group in eighth paragraph and DWR
response in ninth paragraph.)

     Escondido, California, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- A conservative
legal foundation said it will file a lawsuit tomorrow to void long-
term contracts California signed with power generators, claiming
they put an unfair burden on taxpayers.

     The United States Justice Foundation intends to sue in
Sacramento County Superior Court, said Richard D. Ackerman, lead
counsel on the case for the group. The USJF wants a court to
terminate the long-term power contracts and require money already
paid to the generators to be returned to the state.

     The USJF proposes a class action to represent California
taxpayers and alleges violations of the state's business and open-
meeting laws. Ackerman said his group may need to forge new law to
succeed in the case.

     ``You're gonna have some serious legal battles that may go to
the appeals level in this case,'' Ackerman said.

     California officials last spring signed about $43 billion in
long-term power contracts after two investor-owned utilities
became insolvent. Governor Gray Davis has said the contracts were
needed to bring stability to California's energy market. Since
then, the cost of power has dropped, leaving California with
contracts to buy electricity above spot-market prices.

     Enron Corp., Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas
& Electric Company, Green Mountain Energy, San Diego Gas &
Electric Company, Reliant Energy Company, PacifiCorp Power
Marketing, Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, and Calpine Energy Company
have electricity contracts with the state, according to a USJF
press release.

                       `Conservative Voice'

     The USJF said it sent a letter to California officials giving
them notice of its intent to sue. The group, which calls itself
``Your conservative voice in the courts'' on its Web site, is
supported by individual donations, Ackerman said.

     The group has rallied against civil unions for homosexuals
and mandatory student fees the group claimed were illegal taxes on
parents and in favor of prayer in schools and resumption of U.S.
assignations of foreign political figures, according to its Web
site.

     The California Department of Water Resources, the agency
buying power on behalf of some utilities, was unaware of the
lawsuit and therefore couldn't comment, spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said. A spokesman for Davis wasn't immediately available for
comment.



Enron to Meet With Lenders on Merger, Possible Yield Increase
2001-11-07 15:38 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is set to meet
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and other lenders on
Friday to discuss merger plans and a possible increase on the
amount the company pays for existing credit lines, according to
bankers familiar with the matter.

     The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its
offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial
team, led by its new Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the
people said.

     The discussions will focus on a bid by Dynegy Inc. to acquire
the largest energy trader, which is facing a cash crunch because
of falling credit ratings, people familiar with that situation
said.

     Some bankers have also asked Enron to consider an increase to
the yield on the $3 billion of credit lines it drew down last
month. The interest rate of 35 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, on the loans was set in May
before the company's share price plummeted and its credit ratings
were downgraded.

     For a $1 billion credit line arranged last month by J.P.
Morgan and Citibank, Enron is paying as much as 2.5 percentage
points more than Libor.

     Enron officials declined to comment.




Enron Shares Fall on Concern About Finding Investors (Update3)
2001-11-07 15:35 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern About Finding Investors (Update3)

     (Adds Standard & Poor's comment in third paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell as
much as 28 percent, to their lowest level in more than a decade,
amid reports that the No. 1 energy trader is struggling to find
investors to help it out of a cash crunch.

     Shares of Enron fell 63 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $9.04 in
late trading. The shares dropped to $7 earlier. At yesterday's
close, they had fallen 88 percent this year.

     ``Their only real access (to cash) now is through the bank
market,'' said Todd Shipman, a Standard & Poor's director who
covers Enron. An equity infusion ``is what we still think would be
an important part of stabilizing the situation.''

     The shares pared some of today's losses after people familiar
with the situation said Enron is discussing a merger with rival
Dynegy Inc. Both companies are based in Houston.
Dynegy shares fell $2.78, or 7.7 percent, to $33.22.

     Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett decided
against investing in Enron because he wasn't willing to sign a
confidentiality agreement that would keep him from trading Enron's
debt, the New York Times reported today, citing an unidentified
person close to the talks.

     Other companies approached by Enron, including Clayton
Dubilier & Rice, the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
& Co. have also shown little interest, the newspaper said.

     ``Many shrewd investors like Goldman Sachs might find it more
profitable to just pluck off key employees rather than invest in
Enron,'' said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Rating
Co.

                         SEC Investigation

     The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief financial
officer. The entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets,
with trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity. Enron ousted CFO Andrew Fastow last month.

     Standard & Poor's today reduced its rating on Enron's credit-
linked notes to match its downgrade last week of the company's
unsecured bonds. S&P cut four Enron credit-linked issues valued at
about $1.36 billion combined to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+'' and
indicated it may lower the grades again.

     Shipman said the move isn't an additional downgrade and
should have been made last week when S&P reduced the bond rating.
     Fearing that an Enron collapse might cripple the natural gas-
derivatives market, oil and gas producer Apache Corp. said it
backed out of most of its gas hedges, realizing a $70 million gain
so far.

     ``We have been unwinding our hedge positions because of
uncertainty created by Enron's credit problems,'' Apache spokesman
Bill Mintz said. The company now has only one position with Enron
that it's trying to unwind.

     The Apache news was reported earlier by the Times.

                        `Fragile Business'

     ``Their trading business is a very fragile business,'' Egan
said. ``If partners on either side get concerned, trading volumes
decline, which is what is happening now.''

     Other companies mentioned in reports as possible buyers of
all or part of Enron have denied an interest in the idea. General
Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt told CNN today
that ``Enron's really not on our list right now.'' BP Plc Chief
Executive John Browne said ``no'' at a press conference in London
yesterday when asked whether the London-based company would be
interested in buying Enron or a stake in the company.

     Among shares of other energy traders, Mirant Corp. fell 25
cents to $25.26. Williams Cos. fell 2 cents to $28.99.



Enron calls emergency meeting with banks
Financial Times.com
By William Lewis - Nov 07 2001 19:59:36
Enron has called an emergency meeting of its banks on Friday amid growing co=
ncerns on Wall Street that the troubled energy trader will not been able to =
survive its financial crisis unless it finds a strategic partner.=20
Banks with approximately $3.3bn of exposure to Enron are describing the meet=
ing at Enron's headquarters in Houston, Texas as "make or break." One bank e=
xecutive said "this is a pivotal meeting. There are lots of credit lines due=
 in the next six months and we need to talk."=20
With time running out for the company, Enron executives were on Wednesday ma=
king frantic efforts to secure a deal with rival energy group Dynegy. Some a=
t the company hoped to be able to announce a deal late on Wednesday.=20
Shell-owned Coral Energy has also been approached, and there have also been =
calls to private equity groups such as Blackstone Group.=20
But the efforts have been hampered by the SEC investigation into Enron's dea=
lings with funds associated with former executives of the company. Bankers s=
ay that companies that do not already know Enron intimately have been put of=
f entering negotiations because of the uncertainty.=20
If the company fails to complete a deal ahead of Friday's crucial meeting, i=
t will need to persuade the banks to extend credit lines, as it battles to s=
hore up confidence among investors and its trading counterparties.=20
The banks with the greatest exposure to Enron include Credit Suisse, Deutsch=
e Bank, Citigroup and Barclays.=20
Off-balance sheet vehicles affiliated to Enron have $8-$9bn in debt. Enron i=
tself is carrying $12.8bn in debt.=20
The company has been under increasing pressure since October 16, when it dis=
closed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that only exacerbated concerns ab=
out a lack of transparency at the energy trading group.=20
Enron is the principal in a quarter of all electricity and natural gas trade=
s in the US. On Wednesday, the company did not immediately return calls seek=
ing comment.=20
Enron's share price had lost 21.92 per cent of its value by midday on Wednes=
day, and was trading at $7.55, drastically down from a 52-week high of $84.8=
7.=20
"What we have here is a run on the bank by equity investors," said John Olso=
n, vice-president of research at Sanders Morris Harris, an investment bankin=
g and securities firm. "And they have done nothing to alleviate it."=20
Meanwhile, Enron's competitors have begun taking business away from the US's=
 biggest energy trading company.=20
Shahid Malik, president of trading and marketing at Reliant Energy, a big pa=
rticipant in the trading that is central to Enron's business, said: "We're s=
eeing more business come our way because, clearly, some companies are reduci=
ng their exposure to Enron."=20
He said Reliant had maintained normal relations with Enron, noting it was st=
ill credit-worthy.=20
But he added: "We are very carefully monitoring the situation."=20

Some Glamour Stocks That Are Ugly Down Deep

I know it's tempting. I know what you're thinking: If I can catch a big ride=
 on one of these beaten-down stocks, I can get my portfolio back to where it=
 was in March 2000.=20
Forget it. Rip up those old statements. Treat them like UFOs. Instead, think=
 singles and doubles instead of homers. While a number of glamour stocks hav=
e been decimated, they deserve to be decimated. I am an opportunist. I've lo=
oked at all of them. They are a collective disaster, and they are not worth =
the risk.=20
Let's start with Jim Cramer's favorite punching bag, Enron (ENE:NYSE - news =
- commentary) . As bad as this situation is, it is going to get worse before=
 it is over. And while the Bushies may have been willing to help out Bill Ga=
tes with his little Justice Department problem, they will not go near this o=
ne with a 10-foot pole. Enron is not an energy company. It is a trading comp=
any. Moreover, it appears they are not particularly good traders.=20
Instead of Enron, invest your money with the best trading company in the wor=
ld, Goldman Sachs (GS:NYSE - news - commentary) . These guys have probably b=
een picking Enron's pockets for years. Isn't it interesting that Goldman Sac=
hs was unwilling to participate in the recent short-term loans to Enron, an =
investment banking client? They might actually know what's behind the curtai=
n.=20
I worked at Goldman Sachs for eight years, and I have tremendous respect for=
 them. They know how to trade. They made a ton of money handling Sid Bass' r=
ecent 125 million-share block of Walt Disney (DIS:NYSE - news - commentary) =
stock. Forget about the 6-cent-per-share fee they charged. How about the 10 =
million to 20 million shares that they kept for themselves? I imagine that G=
oldman made more than $30 million on this one trade. Not a bad day's work.=20
Stay away from Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . Taken in the best light,=
 the company is way too aggressive with its accounting; Qwest bullies the an=
alyst community and it overpromises and underdelivers. Qwest has justifiably=
 lost the trust of the investment community. It will take years of execution=
 and fence-mending to earn this trust back. Ask Cendant CEO Henry Silverman.=
 He is still paying for the damage inflicted upon him by former Cendant Chai=
rman Walter Forbes, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud =
charges.=20
Go with WorldCom (WCOM:Nasdaq - news - commentary) instead. These guys actua=
lly get it. They are among the telecom industry's best operators, and they a=
re the best dealmakers. Like everyone else, they goofed, but they have found=
 religion. This quarter's operating results show some promise. Previously sk=
eptical analysts at Lehman and Merrill had some nice things to say about the=
 company. I think WorldCom is an up stock from here. It is not going back to=
 the $60s, but I could see it above the driving age by year-end.=20
I know it's also tempting to think that if the economy rebounds, consumer fi=
nance stocks will scream. You are turned on by Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - =
commentary) and Conseco (CNC:NYSE - news - commentary) . Providian recently =
hired my pals at Goldman Sachs to help them out.=20
Forget this, too. Providian feels like a doughnut to me. Their balance sheet=
 is a mess. We do not know how bad it is. They may not know how bad it is. M=
oreover, they were not candid with the investment community.=20
Conseco announced that Gary Wendt and other senior managers bought a bunch o=
f stock with their own money. While I love to see management buying stock, t=
his one feels too staged to me. Pre-Wendt, Conseco had a long history of man=
agement buying stock with loans from the corporate treasury. Moreover, 1 mil=
lion shares (or $3 million) is not that much money to Wendt. I would like to=
 see him buy $25 million of restricted stock directly from the company.=20
Conseco is probably the best speculative bet of the bunch, but I would still=
 pass. It is a very high-risk situation, given the leveraged state of its ba=
lance sheet. Wendt is a tremendous manager, and he did a great job with GE C=
apital. However, he would not be the first guy to have a sequel that bombs a=
t the box office.=20
Go with Citigroup (C:NYSE - news - commentary) instead. Citigroup is the big=
gest and best financial services company in the world. While Wendt is someth=
ing special, I would draft Weill and Rubin ahead of him in my CEO Rotisserie=
 League.=20
The best way to make money is to stay out of trouble. Stick with singles and=
 doubles. Don't be tempted.=20



Fundie Firing Comes Better Late Than Never

Hallelujah! Someone in mutual-fund land lost his job for crummy performance.=
 Two years ago Merrill Lynch decided to hire a real mutual fund gunner, Jame=
s McCall, and install him in the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty and Premier Grow=
th Funds.=20
McCall was from PBHG. There, the guy was a total gunner in the true basketba=
ll sense: all offense, no d. He came to Merrill and played the same game, bu=
ying all of the stocks I have been railing against in these last 18 months. =
This guy owned them all.=20
He proceeded to totally stink up the joint.=20
I don't mourn McCall. He represented the worst strain of money manager, the =
kind who'd never met a high growth stock he didn't like. A man who didn't gi=
ve a hoot about valuation. His bets on BEA Systems, Juniper, EMC, Sonus, Cel=
estica, ONI Systems and Extreme should have been enough to give him the hook=
=2E But he also bit on Enron!=20
McCall's funds were dead last in Merrill's fund standing. So he left. That's=
 what should happen. I just wish it had happened sooner.=20
This industry made a mess of itself the last few years by picking managers w=
ho were reckless in their stock picks and never thought about the downside.=20
The industry really let the investors down.=20
The departure of McCall is a good sign that things are returning to how they=
 should be, where you sacrifice some upside in order to spare your investors=
 the massive downside that McCall experienced.=20
Now, let's hope the other mutual fund families exercise similar discretion.=20
Better late than never.=20
