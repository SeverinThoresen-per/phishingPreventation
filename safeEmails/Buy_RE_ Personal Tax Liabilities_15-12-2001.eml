Tim,
I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to impu=
ted income.
Total Earnings =3D $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed =3D $1,338, 394.08=20
Taxes withheld =3D $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attri=
buted to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the=
 IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was to=
ld that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and =A386k for uK liabili=
ties. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neig=
hborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting o=
f the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 20=
01 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that=
 this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress. =20

I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not d=
oing any work for Enron at the moment.

Ted
