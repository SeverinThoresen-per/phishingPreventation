Subject: Project Hurricane/Bridgeline Status

Here is a quick status and list of to do's related to setting up the new J.V=
=2E=20
between Enron & Texaco which will be combining the LRC and Bridgeline=20
pipeline systems:

Summary:  The LRC & Bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the=20
name of Bridgeline LLC.  Ownership in the JV will be split 60% Texaco & 40%=20
Enron.  Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC will be the entity that will be trading=
=20
on the pipelines under the new J.V.  Contracts and Service  Agreements are i=
n=20
the process of being drafted. =20

Enron will be providing the Trading and Commercial Operations systems to=20
support this J.V.  Texaco will be providing the Scada system.  I understand=20
that Accounting is still being discussed.  The Trading, Risk, & perhaps=20
Scheduling personnel for this JV will be initially relocated to the 21st=20
floor of the Enron Building and will eventually move to probably the 3 Allen=
=20
Center once a more permanent spot can be built out.  Trading for the new JV=20
will start in early February for March Production.

To Do's:

Accounting:  I've asked Jim Coffey to set up two work orders to capture IT=20
transition and ongoing costs.  Texaco is also trying to set up a meeting nex=
t=20
Monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same=20
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks.

PC's:  Jim Fussell is in the process of ordering the PC's for this JV at my=20
request.  I will need the work order numbers to track these costs.

Networks:  I'm coordinating with Arshak and his team to make sure that the=20
voice and data networks are in place for EB 21.  Once the more permanent spo=
t=20
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location.   A=20
combination of Trader phones, Lucent Phones, Stenfons and Amtels have been=20
requested.

Location on EB 21:  I'm waiting on a call back from Chris Larson from=20
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new JV. =
=20
Currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall=20
cubes.  There may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall=20
cubes.  We can't set up the PC's, phones, Amtels, etc until this is done.

Data Conversion:  I have requested from Texaco the contract, deal and=20
meter/facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin=20
trading for March production.  It may be possible to get an electronic dump=20
of this data from Texaco if Enron defines the data fields that we will need.=
 =20
We also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios.  I will also nee=
d=20
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the=20
system security.  I have received the names of the traders but I don't know=20
who else will need access.

Interface between Enron's Unify POP's application and Bridgeline's Scada=20
application:  I've asked Dave Nommensen from Enron to get with Carryn Wright=
=20
from Texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two=20
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface. =20
There will also need to be a transition plan put in place where LRC's=20
RTU's/EFM is redirected to the Bridgeline Scada system.  In the meantime=20
there will be two Scada systems and perhaps two Gas Controls until everythin=
g=20
is merged into one.  This will probably mean some manual interfaces between=20
POP's and Scada for Confirmed noms and EFM volumes until the transition is=20
complete.

Scada Communications:  Currently the LRC RTU's/EFM communicate back to=20
Enron's Scada system via leased lines.  Bridgelines RTU's communicate back t=
o=20
them via a microwave system.  The new JV could save on communications costs=20
by switching LRC's RTU communication to the microwave.  Perhaps this is best=
=20
done as a part of the Scada transition.

Accounting data needed by Texaco for Royalty purposes:  This data needs to b=
e=20
better defined.  I will follow up with John LeDoux from Texaco to get this=20
process started.

Hourly volumes:  Bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be=20
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing.  We need to talk=
=20
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed.  At least=20
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support th=
e=20
billing for this one customer.

Please let me know if you'd like to meet on any of these topics.  I can have=
=20
my assistant set up the meeting if needed.  In the mean time I can be reache=
d=20
at 713-853-6858.  Thanks!  -  Tommy
