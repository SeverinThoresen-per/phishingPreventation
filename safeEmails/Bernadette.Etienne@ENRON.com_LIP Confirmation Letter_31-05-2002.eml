This letter confirms that you have been selected to participate in Enron's L=
iquidation Incentive Pool (LIP) program.  The LIP program is part of the com=
pany's court-approved retention plan and is specifically designed to recogni=
ze employee contributions toward the successful liquidation of non-core busi=
nesses from the Enron estate.

Your supervisor has shared with you a projected LIP participation target.  I=
f you wish to confirm your projected target, feel free to contact your Human=
 Resource representative.

The amount of money placed into and dispersed from the pool will be directly=
 tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.  Therefore, cash collec=
tions as well as individual contributions to the liquidation process could a=
djust, upward or downward, the actual LIP payouts to participating employees=
=2E

A Compensation Committee, made up of senior managers, will have discretion t=
o recommend incentive amounts for participants in the liquidation pool after=
 each $500 million is collected, also called a "collection milestone".  The =
Compensation Committee's recommendations must be approved by the members of =
the Office of the Chief Executive and the Management Committee and are subje=
ct to review by Ernst & Young and the court approved examiner for Enron Nort=
h America.

Cash collections will be monitored through a weekly dashboard and you will b=
e provided regular status updates.  Members of the Office of the Chief Execu=
tive, the Management Committee, and the Compensation Committee will validate=
 the date a collection milestone is reached.

Fifty percent of your earned liquidation incentive for the collection period=
 will be distributed as soon as practical after a milestone is reached.

The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive or any quarterl=
y advance payment is non-vested and deferred.  The length of the deferral pe=
riod varies depending on the collection milestone in which it is earned.

Accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the followin=
g events:
1.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections:
a.	12 months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to the first $=
3 billion,
b.	nine months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to the secon=
d $3 billion, and
c.	six months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to or beyond =
the third $3 billion.
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	Enron's reorganization is complete; or

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress ha=
s been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated to you based on a quarterl=
y floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of a quarterly advance will =
be paid to you as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 20=
02, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance wi=
ll be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive paym=
ents.

If you are an active employee on the validated milestone date, you are eligi=
ble to earn a LIP payment based on your contributions toward the milestone. =
 As a participant in the liquidation incentive pool, you are not eligible fo=
r severance benefits.

Your supervisor will communicate your actual incentive amount after a collec=
tion milestone is reached or at the end of the quarter and project targets f=
or the next collection milestone or upcoming quarter.  These face-to-face me=
etings will be part of a broader performance assessment process designed to =
track individual accomplishments for the benefit of the employee, the compan=
y and the creditors' committee.

Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to Enron.
