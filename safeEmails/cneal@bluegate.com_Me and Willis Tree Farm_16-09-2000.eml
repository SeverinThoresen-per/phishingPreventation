Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
				Pipeline Power Partners
				10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
				Houston, Texas 77024
				713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some o=
f the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94. =
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had=
 tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well Servi=
ce in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we had to=
 replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it upon hims=
elf to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap pump-so that's=
 why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now have only $90 =
in the account so everyone needs to think about making a contribution someti=
me soon. If you have a question, please call.
