Teresa and I spoke with Sharon Butcher today who recommended that the potent=
ial sale of E&P portfolio should be described and approved at this prelimina=
ry stage by Lavorato, Haedicke, Goerte, and Lay et al per policy regarding c=
onflicts. A DASH would follow when the deal gets further along. The issue he=
re is John Thompson and other employees potentially "negotiating a deal" whi=
ch would include their getting equity in the company which purchases assets.=
 Donna and I just spoke and our thoughts are that the deal description curre=
ntly in draft form would be circulated with an approval cover sheet explaini=
ng the reason for the approval sought.

FYI - Teresa and  I are meeting with the HR rep and the Enron employment att=
orney this aft and then all with John so that he understands what process sh=
ould be followed re the employees - ie his communications with them and with=
 potential purchasers. NAncy        =20
