John,

If you need room in your special "Top 50 Bonus" and if you think we will hav=
e bonuses under the ordinary program there is no need to include Mike Mcdona=
ld and Steve Thome right now.   I spoke with both of them last night and for=
 different reasons I dont think they will revolt anytime soon.   The other g=
uys are being bid by competition and/or they have checked with lawyers about=
 their contracts:

Choi - 200
Rosman - 200
Parquet - 250
Thomas - 300

This implies a cash plus equity structure.  This deals with them till 1/31 a=
fter which we will need a clear 2002 bonus and retention program.  =20
