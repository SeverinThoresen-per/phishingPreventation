=20
handled by Wade Price.  Wade will continue setting up new deals, adding=20
meters to deals, adjusting prices (based on information provided by John=20

Once the deal is in the supply list and the appropriate service contract=20
shows up in the service list, a request will be sent to Logistics to path th=
e=20
deal. =20

Please let me know if anyone sees a problem with going forward this way. =20

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian=20
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and=20
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation=
=20
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks,=20
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following=20
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA=
=2E
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed=
=20
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on=20
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for=20
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie
