How odd ? I came away with the impression that:

we would look at the outgoing commercial instructions to see whether they=20
support the activity of the guys in Chicago with phones in their hands, and=20
are in themselves wholly appropriate;
we would address the issue of not having taped lines;
we would address the issue of segregation of duties in the office, other tha=

in Powerpoint
we would get to the bottom of the difference between the AS400 and "Local=20

we would see a revised timeline for the resolution of the other issues in th=

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the=20
transparency and accountability of issues raised.=20

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient=

if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin=20
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the=
=20
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from=20
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get=20
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we=20
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do =
a=20
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their=20
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down=20

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns=20
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems=20
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate=

that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date.=20
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict=20
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls=20
