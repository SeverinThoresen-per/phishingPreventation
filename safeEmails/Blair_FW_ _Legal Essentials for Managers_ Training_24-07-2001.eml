Subject:	"Legal Essentials for Managers" Training

	I am pleased to introduce and offer to ETS management -- "Legal Essentials =
for Managers" -- an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment=
 laws and the practice of good employee relations.  This 4 hour, interactive=
 program was designed while I headed the Office of Labor and Employment Rela=
tions in Corporate HR.  Therefore, it is tailored to Enron's culture and has=
 been further refined to reflect ETS-specific issues.  The target audience a=
re all those persons who have supervisory responsibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-rela=
ted litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee pro=
ductivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understa=
nd the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal req=
uirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment=
 free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance manage=
ment; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effe=
ctively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	Now that we are between PRC periods, I believe it is the most opportune tim=
e to present this program.  It is no cost to your organization.  My staff an=
d I will make all the necessary logistical arrangements, and travel to field=
 locations to present the session as necessary. =20

	All that is needed from you is your support.  Please forward this message t=
hroughout your organization and strongly encourage the attendance of all tho=
se who supervise employees or advise teams on personnel matters.  In fact, y=
our attendance would set a great example.  I am available to attend any staf=
f meetings to further explain the seminar, and I'd be more than happy to fie=
ld e-mails, phone calls, or drop-bys.  =20

	It is my intention to offer as many sessions as necessary to train all mana=
gement by the end of the year.  Each session is best conducted with about 25=
 persons.  Thus, with a target audience of approximately 250, this goal can =
be accomplished in about 10 sessions.

	Below is a schedule of sessions to run from 8:00 - Noon.  Participants are =
asked to contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in any =
of these sessions.  Enrollment will be on a first-come-first-served basis, w=
ith enrollment limited to 30 persons per session.  I will leave a date open =
for Omaha and a date for Denver.  Please let me know which date(s) would be =
best.  Also, if there is another location that I should target, please let m=
e know that as well.

	Thanks for your support.
