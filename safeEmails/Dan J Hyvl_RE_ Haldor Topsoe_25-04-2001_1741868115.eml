Darren,
 There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract=20
that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you=20
mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading=20
type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with=20
Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you=20
request changes to that deal. =20

any preceding confirmations.Please correct me if I am wrong.

Darren,
 Please reread.  This confirm covers the period 9/1/02 - 8/31/04.  The=20
current deal stays in effect until 8/31/02.  Let me know about the hyphen. =20
That is the way they signed the last contract.  You have their published=20
financials,  How is it in the signature portion of those.

Dan,
Everything looks good. In the openning paragraph, I think that=20
"Haldor-Topsoe" should not have the hyphen. Am I correct in assuming that=20
this master supercedes all existing confirms?

As long as we have the Master executed, you can do the extension.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three=20
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes throug=
h=20
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage=20
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all option=
s=20
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by=20
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  The=
y=20
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to=20
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell=20
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE,=
=20
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is=20
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it wil=

be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can=20
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until=20
their master is signed as well.=20

If you have any questions please call.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at=
=20
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  A=
s=20
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and thi=
s=20
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is=
=20
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instea=
d=20
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not=20
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell
