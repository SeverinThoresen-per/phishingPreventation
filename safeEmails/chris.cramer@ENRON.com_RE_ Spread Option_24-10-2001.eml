I am but I have been very busy over here just as you are as well.  I guess t=
he way that things usually happen is that unless the originator pushes somet=
hing to happen, I don't worry about it very much.  Maybe not the best way to=
 handle, but my work schedule is usually swamped from 6:30 am till about 4:0=
0 pm.  I do want to get together but I will have to let you know if today is=
 good.  The AGA comes out today, could be a busy afternoon.  Sorry about thi=
s.  Please do not think I am blowing you off.  I will call you later.=20

What is your number?

Thanks for your patience.
