Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love=
 to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it=
 would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner t=
ogether.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some=
 fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday nigh=
t before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back o=
n Wednesday after breakfast. =20
Whatever works for you will be great, though. =20

I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League Nationa=
l meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday nigh=
t is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier=
, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a=
 good time catching up.=20
