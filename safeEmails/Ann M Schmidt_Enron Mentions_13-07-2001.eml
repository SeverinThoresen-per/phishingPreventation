California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)

California Power Bills Exceed Refunds, Judge Says (Update4)

     (Adds legislator comment in sixth paragraph, details from
judge in 11th paragraph, negotiator comment in 12th paragraph.)

     Washington, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- California's debts to
power sellers for electricity purchases exceed any refund the
state can claim for alleged overcharging, a judge overseeing
settlement talks said in a report to federal regulators.
     California and its utilities may be owed more than $1 billion
on claims generators overcharged them, Administrative Law Judge
Curtis Wagner wrote in a report to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. California alleges power sellers like Duke Energy
Corp., Enron Corp. illegally inflated prices by $8.9 billion.
     ``While there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are
even larger amounts owed to energy sellers'' by California and its
utilities, Wagner wrote. He said the state is owed ``hundreds of
millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars.''
     The decision strengthens the generators' claim that the
state's request for billions isn't supported by the facts. Energy
companies have offered a total of $716 million in refunds to the
state, Wagner said.
     FERC-ordered negotiations between the state and the energy
sellers broke down without an agreement this week. FERC will
decide on the size of refunds within 60 days. California Governor
Gray Davis has said the state will sue if it does not receive the
refunds it demanded.
     ``I find it unlikely that someone will not be unhappy enough
to go to court,'' said State Senator Debra Bowen, a Democrat from
Los Angeles. ``There's too much money at stake.''

                         Wagner's Report

     FERC will use Wagner's report to calculate the size of any
refunds. California could receive refunds in the form of credit
against power-buying debts. In his report, Wagner didn't say how
much the state and its utilities owe to power companies.
     ``Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is
due the seller? The chief judge thinks not,'' wrote Wagner, who is
FERC's chief administrative law judge.
     Wagner provided suggestions to the FERC commissioners on how
to set any refunds. He urged that they calculate potential
overcharges beginning October 2000. California had urged the
settlement be figured from May 2000.
     Davis criticized that decision, calling it ``a $3 billion
free gouge for the generators'' in a statement released by his
office.
     The judge said California had rejected a settlement offer he
made during the talks. He did not say what that settlement offer
was. He said California would not budge from its initial demand.
He also said California did not provide him some of the background
information he requested until this week.
     ``If we had more time we might have been able to respond more
quickly, but we did the best we could,'' said Michael Kahn,
chairman of the Independent System Operator, the state's electric
grid manager. He led the state delegation.

                    Heart of Dispute

     At the heart of the dispute are federal regulations that
require power sellers to charge only those rates deemed by federal
regulators to be ``just and reasonable.'' FERC had price caps in
place when some of the disputed power purchases were made.
     Energy companies claim that rising natural-gas prices and a
lack of adequate supply pushed prices up. The state accuses the
companies reaping unreasonable profits.
     Davis has made attacks on power generators a staple of his
response to the energy crisis, and has accused them of gouging the
state in dozens of speeches since January. He said that if the
state isn't paid $8.9 billion, it would sue for up to $20 billion.
     Energy executives accuse Davis and California political
leaders of attempting to scapegoat the energy companies for a
failed deregulation plan that led to soaring wholesale prices last
year. The state's largest two utilities can't pay for their power.
     ``It's pretty clear that the state has no particular interest
in resolving this,'' Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said
in an interview with Bloomberg News. ``It makes for good political
fodder, and so I think they'll spend a lot of time making a lot of
noise about it.''
     Several other energy companies praised the judge's
recommendations.
     ``We agree with the judge's position that the $8.9 billion
refund number is totally unsubstantiated,'' Duke Energy Corp.
spokesman Tom Williams said.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
investor-owned utilities, ran up more than $14 billion in debt
buying electricity last year. The state stepped in and began
buying power for them in January, and has spent more than $7
billion.




California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit

California Governor Casts Blame for Crisis, to His Benefit

     San Francisco, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor
Gray Davis's popularity is bouncing back, and pollsters credit the
Democratic lawmaker's campaign to blame the state's energy
problems on out-of-state power companies.
     Davis has criticized Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp. and other
power sellers as price gougers since January. This week, Davis
used a power-plant opening as a platform to claim that energy
sellers are ``bleeding us dry.'' The Democratic state attorney
general and Democratic-controlled state Senate are investigating
the firms for market manipulation.
     The governor is winning support because of his attacks. A Los
Angeles Times poll in June showed that 86 percent of Californians
believed power generators distorted prices. Davis's approval
rating rose to 52 percent of registered voters in June, from 46
percent in early April, his lowest since being elected in 1998,
his pollster, Paul Maslin, found.
     ``Gray Davis is very good at licking his fingers and seeing
which way the political winds blow,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
``And he's found good villains.''

                    Outlook for Settlement

     The politics may make it harder for the state to reach a
settlement with energy companies for claims they overcharged the
state by $8.9 billion, analysts say. A federal judge overseeing
settlement talks said the state is owed far less. Davis says the
state will sue for $18 billion if its demands aren't met.
     ``There is no way you are going to get any kind of agreement
from someone making such audacious claims,'' said Donato Eassey,
an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Houston.
     The refunds may be secondary to Davis's effort to be re-
elected in 2002, a victory that political analysts say position
him as a contender for national office in 2004.
     ``He's in good shape going into 2002, and if he wins, there's
the inevitable speculation about whether he eyes a run for
president in 2004,'' Cain said.
     Just months ago, Davis's public approval ratings were at
their lowest point since he was elected, according to a Field
Institute poll in April.
     PG&E Corp.'s utility, the state's largest, was in bankruptcy.
Wholesale-power prices were rising, and millions of Californians
lost power in a string of blackouts caused by reduced power
reserves.

                         Governor Rebounds

     The governor was widely criticized for failing to act swiftly
to end the crisis. Now Davis seems to be recovering, analysts
said.
     While vilifying the power companies, the first-term governor
has also been spearheading the state's response to the energy
crisis. He has created a team to negotiate a financial rescue
package to save Edison International's Southern California Edison
utility from bankruptcy, started an $800 energy conservation drive
and pushed for more power plants to be built.
     The energy companies lashed back at Davis this week. A
spokesman for Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader,
accused Davis and California leaders of conducting a political
``witch hunt.''
     ``The last thing they want to do is take responsibility for
the problem they created,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.
``They set about looking for the biggest villains.''
     Enron filed suit against a California state Senate committee
investigating allegations of market manipulation, accusing the
panel and its Democratic chairman in a letter of seeking a
``scapegoat'' for a failed deregulation law.

                   Plotting his Response

     Davis began plotting his response to the crisis almost
immediately after it became public in January, said Garry South,
his chief political strategist. Step one, Davis aides said, was to
blame the energy companies that were profiting from the state's
woes. Davis targeted a half-dozen companies. In addition to Enron
and Duke, Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos.
were placed in the crosshairs.
     ``There was a group of perpetrators from out of state
manipulating this system and screwing consumers,'' South said.
``We had to explain how this thing happened.''
     Republicans criticize Davis for inaction on the crisis, while
acknowledging he is favored to win re-election going into next
year's campaign.
     He leads three potential rivals -- Secretary of State Bill
Jones, banker William Simon, the son of former Treasury Secretary
William Simon, and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
according to the Times poll of 1,541 state residents conducted
June 23-26.
     ``He will be the favorite,'' said Rob Stutzman, a consultant
for the California Republican Party.

                         Worries Ahead

     Davis still has worries as the state struggles to address the
energy crisis, analysts say.
     PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy in
April. Edison International's Southern California Edison, the No.
2 utility, is struggling to overcome legislative opposition to the
financial-rescue package negotiated by Davis.
     Davis may be blamed, analysts say, if the state Legislature
refuses to ratify the rescue plan for Edison and the utility files
for bankruptcy. Republicans and many Democrats in the Legislature
oppose the agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding.
     ``The MOU's dead, and the likely scenario is for the utility
is to go into bankruptcy,'' said Peter Navarro, an associate
professor of economics and public management at the University of
California at Irvine.
     California voters may receive unpleasant reminders of the
crisis all summer. The state has already suffered through six days
of rolling blackouts, and more are predicted.
     ``As soon as the lights go out, it's Gray's fault,'' Navarro
said.
