Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Document=
s are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalanc=
e invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view b=
oth the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also vi=
ew the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalan=
ce, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement I=
nformation) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to A=
ctuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps =
and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for insta=
nce, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will =
also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas tha=
t are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Larry
