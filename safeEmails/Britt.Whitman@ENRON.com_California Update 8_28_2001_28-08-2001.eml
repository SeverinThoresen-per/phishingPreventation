EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=B7     Legislative Maneuvering Towards a Bail-Out Plan=20

MOU Developments
The Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee held hearings yesterday=
 on the SoCal bailout plan, AB 82.  The chairman of the committee, Rod Wrigh=
t, has agreed with Hertzberg and Davis to move something out of the committe=
e, possibly by mid-week.  Much of the Assembly's efforts to move along a com=
prehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 amendmen=
ts.  Additionally, demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort owners op=
posing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may also slo=
w the process.

Three Central Valley Democrats (Reyes, Flores and Canciamilla) on the Assemb=
ly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability will likely be paying close at=
tention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements, as farmers=
 are significant in their districts.  All three legislators face reelection.=
  Reyes has already signaled that, even though she voted for the bailout las=
t time, she is disinclining to do so again.  These three Democrats may imped=
e the progress of the bailout.  There are strong indications that the plan w=
ill not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass.  At this po=
int there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the Democratic side.

Another substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by SoCal f=
or "fair market value" of its transmission assets, rather than book value.  =
This value, of course, would have to be estimated and essentially means that=
 even more money would have to go toward the bailout.  While Committee Chair=
man Wright would not oppose this idea, it will likely be hard for many of hi=
s colleagues to swallow, particularly on the Senate side.

Once the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the Assembly=
 Energy Costs and Availability Committee, it will then go to Assembly Approp=
riations.  The chair of this committee, Carol Migden, is friendly with both =
Hertzberg and Governor Davis, so the plan appears unlikely to receive signif=
icant opposition in her committee.  It will then go to the Assembly floor fo=
r a vote.  Since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the Assemb=
ly, it likely will fall to the Senate to decide ultimately if a SoCal bailou=
t makes it to the governor or not.  Therefore, it becomes important to exami=
ne what deals might be made between Burton and Davis in order to get a bailo=
ut through the Senate.  For example, Burton wants a change in the workers' c=
ompensation laws to increase payouts to workers.  This is a very important i=
ssue.  On the one hand, both trial lawyers and the unions support Burton.  O=
n the other hand, he is strongly opposed by the powerful CTMA, the Republica=
ns and pro-business Democrats, including Governor Davis.  In fact, Davis has=
 already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promised to do so aga=
in.  It is conceivable, though unlikely, that a deal could be struck whereby=
 Burton would allow a SoCal bailout to pass in exchange for Davis signing wo=
rkers' compensation reform.  However, if this were to happen, both the bailo=
ut and the workers' comp reform together would be an enormous burden on Cali=
fornia businesses at a time when these businesses are not doing well.  This =
is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely at this time.
