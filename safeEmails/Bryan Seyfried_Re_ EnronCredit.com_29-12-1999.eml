caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it ma=
y=20
not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for=20
some time.

When would you like to go to New York to meet with Sullivan & Cromwell?  Let=

expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very=20
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit=20
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently=20
