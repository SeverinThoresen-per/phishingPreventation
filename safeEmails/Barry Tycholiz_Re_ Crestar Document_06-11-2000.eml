this index is unavailabe at the time of the transaction or the index has=20
separated from the fixed price for that day then the counterparties have=20
agreed that we can buy/sell on a fixed price.  In either scenerio, when ECC=20
is acting as the agent, we shall be held harmless from a price exposure..


If this explanation is not clear enough... give me a call.=20
