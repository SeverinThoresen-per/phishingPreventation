critical to the Texas business, and it is critical to our team that we are=20
timely and accurate.

2).  Rita:  Thanks for setting up the account team.  Communication is=20
critical to our success, and I encourage you all to keep each other informed=
=20

Additionally, this is high profile, so we want to assure top quality.

Thanks to all of you for all of your efforts.  Let me know if there is=20

Subject: Entex Transistion

The purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday=20
with members from Commercial and Volume Managment concernig the Entex accoun=
t:

 Effective January 2000, Thu Nguyen (x37159) in the Volume Managment group,=20
will take over the responsibility of allocating the Entex contracts.  Howard=
=20
and Thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the=20
account over the next few months.  Entex will be Thu's primary account=20
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations=20
process and the contracts. =20
Howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be=20
available for questions or as a backup, if necessary (thanks Howard for all=20
your hard work on the account this year!).   =20
In the initial phases of this transistion, I would like to organize an Entex=
=20
"account" team.  The team (members from front office to back office) would=20
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the=20
scheduling, allocations, settlements, contracts, deals, etc.  This hopefully=
=20
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues befor=
e=20
the finalization process, but to learn from each other relative to your=20
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account a=
s=20
well.  I would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as I=20
believe this is a critical part to the success of the Entex account. =20

I will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1/2000.=
 =20
If anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me or stop=
=20
by.  Thanks in advance for everyone's cooperation...........


Julie - Please add Thu to the confirmations distributions list
