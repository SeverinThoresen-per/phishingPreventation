Jacques,

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent=
 to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I =
would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the=
 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort =
of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Phillip
