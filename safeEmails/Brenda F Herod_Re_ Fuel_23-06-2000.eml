Per Mary, Sitara can not handle it either.  It can calculate and withhold=20
volume from the deal as a % for fuel, but not as part of the price.  Steve=20

follow-up on this throughout the systems, and get back with Ed to further=20
discuss?  I'd really appreciate it.

We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what %=20
HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our=20
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think=
=20
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel=20
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come u=
p=20
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline. =20
Currently, this process is not in place.

What is the answer?  Can the systems and processes handle this?  Please let=20
me know ASAP.  Thanks.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is ge=
t=20
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and=20
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the=20
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?
