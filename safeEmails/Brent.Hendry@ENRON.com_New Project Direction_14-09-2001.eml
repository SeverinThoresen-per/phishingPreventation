Mark,
I can use your advise on a few new projects that I am working on.

1.  The weather desk is trying to roll out a HDD Swap for Calgary by Monday.=
  Most of the anticipated buyers of the product will be Canadian counterpart=
ies ECC has masters with.  The desk originally thought that we need to creat=
e a GTC for Enron Canada using the ENA weather GTC.  Because if the time iss=
ues involved in creating a new GTC (fixing all the things that are wrong wit=
h the ENA form) I looked for a new way to deal with this issue.  I think I f=
ound it in section 3(d) of the ETA which provides that the Enron counterpart=
y to a particular transaction will be the Enron Entity they have a master wi=
th that covers that type of transaction.  I believe this provision was a str=
oke of genius designed for just this type of scenario.  I can prepare the lo=
ng description to specify the Enron entity as "the applicable Enron entity" =
and if there is a master then the Enron Entity is the one with the master pu=
rsuant to Section 3(d) of the ETA and if there is no master the ETA says the=
 GTC applies and the GTC specifies that ENA is the counterparty.  Do you thi=
nk this works?

2.  I was contacted by someone at McKinsey & Company yesterday who is workin=
g with the weather desk to develop a Bermuda Transformer Commercial Structur=
e to partner up with the Insurance market to provide some capital to our wea=
ther trading desk.  I have been told that conceptually it will be a Jedi typ=
e arrangement.  I have been asked to help them think through the issues and =
coordinate with the other attorneys who work on these types of issues.  I do=
 not want to get too deep into the structuring of this investment vehicle my=
self without the appropriate legal group involved.  Would this be something =
Jordan Mintz's group would handle or would this be something that Lance Schu=
ler's group would develop?  I thought I might want to talk to Julia Murrey (=
or Cristina Mordant or Carol St. Clair) to see what issues cropped up in the=
 development of Jedi I and Jedi II (or maybe I should just talk to whatever =
lawyer is currently handling these structures).  What are your thoughts on h=
ow to move forward?

3.  The other rush deal is a financing deal out of Jordan's group.  The deal=
 I helped look at that was a physical forward using ISDA type language is no=
w a financial deal (a series of Total Return Swaps) that needs to close next=
 Friday.  I will go to a meeting in the morning to try and get more informat=
ion on the structure.  Angela Davis who has worked on the Total Return swap =
deals has offered to help me pilot this through.  Sara thought I should chec=
k with you to make sure you don't have a problem with me taking on one of th=
ese deals.  I am going to try and make sure they have Danny Sullivan from A&=
K working on the deal since he is the most knowledgeable lawyer on this type=
 of structure. =20

I hope all goes well with your return flight plans.
