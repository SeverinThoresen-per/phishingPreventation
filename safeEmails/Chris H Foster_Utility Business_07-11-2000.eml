Jeff:

Following is a summary of recent EPMI West Power activity with the 3=20
California utilites

PG&E - EEI Master Agreement in place.  As part of their recent RFP, we=20
completed 2, 50 MW,  5 year, sale transactions for peak hours at $58.40 and=20
$58.70.  They are looking at EOL although they have not transacted on it. =20
They call regularly for shorter dated quotes.  We deal with Claudia Grief wh=
o=20
works in Joe Henri's group.  Overall, we have a very positive relationship=20
and look forward to increasing business.

Edison - Almost finished negotiation of a EEI Master Agreement to allow=20
transactions.  We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to=
=20
be resolved shortly.  We participated in their only RFP.   They did not=20
transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet.   We=
=20
work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu.  Since master contracts=20
are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this=20
relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E.  I would expect=20
that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year.  They ar=
e=20
looking at EOL.

SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.  We hav=
e=20
been trying to sell them longer dated energy (5 years).  We believe they hav=
e=20
bought from others but for small size and limited duration.  We work with=20
Sharon Firooz.  We have sent them master EEI agreements and are not making a=
s=20
much progress in getting them to agree.  They prefer using the  WSPP contrac=
t=20
rather than EEI.  We hate WSPP.  We will keep pounding on them until they se=
e=20
the light but it will likely take longer.  Plus they are far more skittish=20
re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.  This said, I would=20
be surprised if we were not transacting with them on shorter term deals by Q=
1=20
2001.  They are not using EOL.
