Greg stopped by to say that  the in the aftermath of the BPA/Kaiser non-deal=
=20
the following further sub-deals could materialize.

Kaiser already has exercised a 24 hour notice right to sell balance of the=20
month energy to BPA at index.  If BPA does not want the index power=20
(unlikely) we could buy it from BPA.  No prepay strings.

Kaiser may give BPA 48 hour notice to do a January remarketing deal at an=20
unknown price.  I'm not sure if we would purchase the power from BPA. =20

Kaiser may give BPA a seven day notice to do a five month deal beginning in=20
February which we might consider doing a prepay for.

Alcoa and another company are trying to close a deal by the end of the year=20
whereby they are going to purchase a power plant-industrial complex at=20
Longview, Washington. (Our origination guys are always working on something=20
at Longview and this is probably it.)  As part of the closing, they are goin=
g=20
to want to shut down part of the site and sell the power on the forward=20
market.  There is a  potential that we might buy the power from them through=
=20
BPA and perhaps prepay for it.

I told Greg the legal team, having worked through many of the issues on this=
=20
kind of transaction last week, would stand by to help with any further=20
developments. ----cgy=20
