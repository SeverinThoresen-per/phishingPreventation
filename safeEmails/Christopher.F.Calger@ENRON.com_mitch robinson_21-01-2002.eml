I just told Mitch that I might be able to get him a little more $ in the for=
m of cash/equity and mitigate his non-compete concerns.   He asked about the=
 title and raise and said that you suggested title was possible and probably=
 the only way to get more $.  Is he working us?  I am OK with a VP promotion=
 because he sure seems like some of the other VP's, but Kevin did not think =
he earned it.  As such, I have been trying to convince him that there is no =
difference between VP and Director; he is one of 15 lead marketers (half VP,=
 half Director) and he will be compared to his peers and more importantly he=
 will be compensated based primarily on financial performance.  =20
=20
Bottom Line: VP with base of $150 gets him done.  I am trying to get him don=
e with $25 cash/equity plus a $15K raise.  If you think it is better to bite=
 the bullet and make him a VP, I am ok but we need to talk with Kevin. =20
=20
I know this sounds flaky, but I don't know these East guys as well as you an=
d Kevin do so I am relying on your input.
