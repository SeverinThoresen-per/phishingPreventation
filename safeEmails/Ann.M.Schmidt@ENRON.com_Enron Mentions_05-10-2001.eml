NEW YORK -- Although Enron Corp. plans to scale back its European operations=
, the Houston energy-trading company isn't looking to pare U.S. payrolls.=20
"There's nothing out of (the) ordinary planned for the rest of the business,=
" said company spokeswoman Karen Denne. "We are continuing to hire in the bu=
sinesses most rapidly growing."=20
Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services, she said.=20
Earlier Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between=
 5% to 10% of its European staff, or as many as 500 workers.=20
This past summer, the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron=
 Broadband Services division. The number of employees affected by this decis=
ion wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said.=20
Before Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on t=
he New York Stock Exchange. But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron =
(ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60. With these latest gains, the stock i=
s now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago.=20
For several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors strug=
gled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including de=
clining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executiv=
e, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its I=
ndian power plant project.=20
The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargai=
ns or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of=
 some overseas assets.=20
On Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to =
BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further suppo=
rt by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc. (DYN) an=
d Aquila Inc. (ILA) in recent days.=20

Enron Seeks To Cut Staff In Europe By 5%-10%

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Eu=
rope by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John She=
rriff said Thursday.=20
"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our head=
count here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achi=
eve this through a program of voluntary severance," Sherriff replied in a wr=
itten response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.
The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in=
 Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to e=
xpand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading busine=
sses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market li=
beralization in the E.U.=20
The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back in=
dividual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses.=20

Enron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continual=
ly giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretch=
ing itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets.=20
"Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and=
 numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking way=
s to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff said.=
=20
"It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continual=
ly review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that=
 they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings," he added.=20
While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power tradi=
ng since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in oth=
er products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to ha=
ve developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify =
Enron's pure trading strategy.=20
Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in ene=
rgy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the=
 physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approac=
h to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directiv=
e came into effect in 1999.=20
As such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake i=
n Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained fro=
m buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany.=20
However, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and th=
e acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Select Energy Inc.'s planned purchase of Niagara Moha=
wk Energy Marketing Inc. will speed up by a year or two the company's plans =
to expand its business beyond New England to the entire Northeast, Select's =
president said.=20
The acquisition stengthens Select Energy's position in New York and the Mid-=
Atlantic, boosting its efforts to become a regional leader in the business o=
f managing energy supply for industrial and commercial customers and trading=
 electricity in the region.
"We want to be the dominant player here," President William Schivley said in=
 an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "By being the dominant player in the=
 Northeast, we'll be considered a national player."=20
Select, a unit of Berlin, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities (NU), faces =
competition from national heavyweights like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy (=
DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC).=20
Select Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and r=
etail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings =
Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets.=20
Integration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Moha=
wk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said.=
=20
The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy=
 regulators rule on the combination. Select Energy has said it plans to keep=
 Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open.=20
The company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is ex=
pected in late November.=20
Select has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion. Niagara Mohawk Energy Mark=
eting had revenues of $635 million in 2000.=20
Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation =
and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said.=20
"This is more than just window shopping," Schivley said. "We are actively se=
eking out hard assets."=20
The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Ni=
agara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Gr=
id Group PLC (NGG), he added.=20
Within the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likel=
y to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those=
 needs become more complicated, Schivley said. Energy, along with labor and =
raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said.=20
"We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds," Schivley said. "We=
've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expand=
ed dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, wou=
ld have taken us a year or two to get to."=20

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

10/04/2001

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional dele=
gation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Co=
mmission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to=
 air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC=
's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO.=20
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing th=
e concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result=
 in cost savings for the region's consumers.=20
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-be=
nefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the eff=
ort.=20
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained tha=
t "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid age=
nda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what=
 it does for local reliability."=20
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's h=
earing.=20
The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, than=
ks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hear=
ing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the =
region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefi=
ts.=20
"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use =
consumers in the Northwest," the Public Power Council testified. "Although w=
ork is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmissio=
n system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled becaus=
e FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good."=20
"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmis=
sion ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest," declar=
ed a group of transmission-dependent utilities.=20
"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize=
 most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason,=
 the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small," said =
a group of aluminum producers.=20
Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators i=
n the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under=
 large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast.=20
'RTO Week'=20

FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that=
 he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during "RTO =
Week" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the co=
mmission's RTO mandate.=20
"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in th=
e suits arguing about it for eight years now," Wood said at an "energy commu=
nity" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va.=20
Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that =
FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at it=
s Sept. 26 meeting.=20
The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of it=
s claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will transl=
ate into consumer savings.=20
Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combinin=
g the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO =
would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits.=20
During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Colu=
mbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected=
 state regulators.=20
Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in su=
pporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the =
effort as "economically dangerous."=20
Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood=
 that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionaliza=
tion but the lack of consultation by FERC.=20
The state regulators want "an opportunity to be at the table," McRae said. I=
f such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she pre=
dicted.=20
FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said,=
 adding that he was "blindsided" by the opposition among state regulators to=
 FERC's grid-consolidation mandate.=20
Later in the day, Wood told reporters that "RTO Week" will feature an entire=
 hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators.=20
At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls f=
or carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the contr=
ol of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long tr=
ansition from regulation to competition.=20
"This process needs to be goosed," said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders "an =
external catalyst" to get the process moving.=20
"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that," he said.=20

NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity =
grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential c=
ustomers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider.=20
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for process=
ing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retai=
l electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, =
NewPower said in a statement.
The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months befor=
e consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail e=
lectricity provider.=20
New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided t=
o switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets=
=2E=20
The New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. , is the first na=
tional provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small comm=
ercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States.=20
The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was del=
ayed two months due to computer problems.=20
The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002.=

States protest federal involvement in electricity competition, deregulation
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme C=
ourt the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open =
their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation.=
=20
But one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the c=
ourt Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gon=
e even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.
During the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they=
 will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nati=
on's power grids and the future of electricity competition.=20
At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale po=
wer markets and interstate transmission of power, was being "whipsawed" from=
 both directions.=20
The commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditiona=
l utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, t=
riggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerou=
s states to end monopolies in retail power markets.=20
But utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing t=
hat the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail=
 sales, usurping a traditional state function.=20
At the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law bec=
ause it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continue=
d to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the ca=
se in many states that have yet to allow competition.=20
In June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, promp=
ting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators.=20
"It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds," Lawrence Ma=
lone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told=
 the justices at Wednesday's hearing. The other states party to the lawsuit =
are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermon=
t and Wyoming.=20
Malone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre=
-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates.=20
"This case isn't about rates," countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Pow=
er Marketing Inc. before the court. "What we're concerned about is getting o=
nto the (grid) system."=20
Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state=
 that has not moved to competition may still "hog" the lines and keep Enron =
and similar marketers from moving power across a region.=20
The Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the =
commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competit=
ors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the stat=
es.=20
Edwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his v=
iew, could have gone further, as Enron has argued. But, he said, to do so it=
 would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and tr=
ansmission, something it chose to leave to the states.=20
The case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, come=
s at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid =
reliability in light of recent power problems in California.=20
About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity com=
petition.=20
Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasize=
d that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve w=
ithout smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not=
 nationally. And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with t=
raditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission.=20
In an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign t=
o establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the na=
tional power grid. A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority ov=
er open access to transmission lines could affect that effort.=20
Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in req=
uiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to e=
mbrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts.=20
