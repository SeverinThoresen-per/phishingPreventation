Ben, confirming our conversation earlier today regarding the two items
below,

Mark Fisher, a Data Analyst in our Information Services group is available
on Friday March 8, at 1:30 PST to address your questions regarding the
downloading of data from SCADA. Mark and I will contact you in your office
at 3:30CST.

Regarding the defective Eickoff gearbox on WTG #79 at Trent Mesa, today EWC
will ship a replacement Flender gearbox to Trent Mesa from our Tehachapi
location. It is our plan to install this gearbox in place of the defective
Eickoff gearbox and return the turbine to operational status as soon as
possible.

Regards

Kurt
