Sorry I'm just now getting back to you.  Here are some answers to your
questions.

Waskom is a field in East Texas (Harrison County) where we purchase gas from
PennzEnergy at the Bryson C.P. and Jeter #2 wells.  The gas is termed up to=20
New
Waskom Gas Gathering (NWGG) through June 2001 (the term of the PennzEnergy
purchase).  We then buy the gas back from NWGG into our Tetco East Texas poo=
l
=2E.. also termed up through 6/01.

Virginia Field used to be associated with NGPL, but several years ago
PennzEnergy worked out a processing arrangement with Corpus Christi Gas
Gathering, so the gas is now termed up with CCGM through 6/01 ... priced off=
=20
of
the Houston Ship Channel.

Jennings Ranch used to flow into NGPL through a gathering line, but a couple=
=20
of
years ago NGPL sold that line to Midcon Texas, so we now handle it as anothe=
r
Midcon Texas property.  Sometimes we sell it at the meter to Midcon Texas=20
(KN),
and sometimes we ship it through Midcon to our NGPL South Texas pool.

Carthage:  Altra picks up their gas in their Cartwheel agreement.  The
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement.  It is not much
different than a Hub agreement, except it allows title tracking.  TGT on the
whiteboard refers to Texas Gas ... East Ohio takes their gas into Texas Gas =
on
a couple of different transport contracts.

Let me know if you have more questions.

David
