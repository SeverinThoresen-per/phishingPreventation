Daren:

On 1/25/2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 Mmbtus into HPL's=20
pipeline.  Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  =20
Logistics needs approval to write-off this volume to Unaccounted for Gas. =20
(Please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).



 ________________________________________________________________
 APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss

The above meter was a new meter effective 1/1/2000, and therefore, the volum=
e=20
flowing into HPL was probably caused by putting the meter in service.

Thanks, Clem
