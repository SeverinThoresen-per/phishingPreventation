I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's =
letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to "cooperate" =
with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues w=
e will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the =
meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the stand=
ards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for t=
oday if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off=
 this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF
