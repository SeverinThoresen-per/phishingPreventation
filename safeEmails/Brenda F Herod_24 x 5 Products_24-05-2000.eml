Eric Bass, Texas Desk trader, requested the following product described belo=
w=20
be traded on EnronOnline. This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will=20
have to be put in manually.=20

The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple=20
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently,=20
EnronOnline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge=
=20
monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently=20
cleared out of the monitor.=20

Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these=20
transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL=20
description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes=20
weekends. The "Wkd" is short for week days.)

We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be=20
prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into=20
the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple=20
dates for these types of products.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824
Thank you.=20

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow=
,=20
May 24th.=20

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas=20
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk i=
n=20
that the Product  description has an=20
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day=
=20
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,=20
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be=20
diligent to identify these Products based=20
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products ar=
e=20
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably -=20
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days=20
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these=20
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider=20
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low=
,=20
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.
