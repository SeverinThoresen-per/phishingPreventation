Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000=20
forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes=
=20
to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.=
 =20
You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok. =20

The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time=20
involved in updating the deal.
