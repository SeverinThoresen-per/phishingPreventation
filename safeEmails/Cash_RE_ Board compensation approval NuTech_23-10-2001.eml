I haven't specifically referenced NuTech in my questions to them.  I also pr=
obably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of i=
nterest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron.  We'll dis=
cuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree t=
o any of those types of provisions.  Yikes! =20

The following is the email I sent Aaron last week.  I called him this mornin=
g to confirm if this was accurate.  He's meeting later today with Mary Joyce=
 and said he'll get back to me.  I did not inquire specifically about NuTech=
--I assume Michelle is doing that.

Aaron:

Based on our conversations, it is my understanding that the compensation com=
mittee has asked to review compensation plans for our affiliates if we own a=
pproximately 50% or more of the company.  The determination of exactly which=
 plans must go to the committee will be made by Mary Joyce upon receipt of a=
 bullet point presentation of the key terms of the plan.  The committee woul=
d likely review any compensation plan pursuant to which (i) employees receiv=
e equity interests without making capital contributions in cash or other pro=
perty with reasonably equivalent value to the equity interests, (ii) employe=
es receive equity interests prior to Enron recovering its investment, or (ii=
i) employees are to be offered employment agreements with terms that are not=
 within "Enron norms."  In addition, all significant terms of the compensati=
on plan are to be disclosed in the DASH.

Do I understand this all corrrectly?  Is there anything I have omitted?

If the committee meets only quarterly, timing could certainly be an issue in=
 some transactions.  If that is the case, can special meetings be called?
