Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which =
I=20
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the=20
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please=20
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal=20
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept=20
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's=20
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average=20
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the=20
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we=20
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval=20
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers=
=20
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project=20
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at=
=20
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed=
=20
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions,=
=20
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at=20
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot=20
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting,=20
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described=20
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics=20
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and=
=20
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.=
 =20
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined=20
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or=20
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This projec=
t=20
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben
