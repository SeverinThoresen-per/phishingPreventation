Hi My Man,
=20
Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told=
 me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisio=
ns, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can =
do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifti=
ng etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jer=
ky or quick lifting that could hurt me.
=20
I can't wait to have some albacore sashimi and a little Craig on the sheetsh=
eemi!  ;)
=20
Love,
