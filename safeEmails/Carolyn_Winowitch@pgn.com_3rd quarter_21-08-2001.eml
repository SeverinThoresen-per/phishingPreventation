Just wanted to follow up on one thing from our conversation on Friday. In Se=
pt, you need the 3rd current estimate, but are ok with us providing it to yo=
u the week of the 17th, rather than the 13th. And this will be the 3rd curre=
nt estimate, not just the normal cash flow forecast? Then in October, we are=
 back to the normal cash flow forecast, correct? Let me know, thanks!
