Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet =
in the next day or two (I'll be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow=
). Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probab=
ly is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that's now on its way to Califo=
rnia for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do i=
t fairly quickly.

Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it's $1,377,550, not $1,360=
,000.

HOWEVER!! Here's info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; i=
t's a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a reall=
y ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reserv=
oir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be a=
round long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to th=
e postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the build=
ing is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power b=
oxes a month in the area. It's really growing. Let me know what you think!!

With best regards, Jim Wills
