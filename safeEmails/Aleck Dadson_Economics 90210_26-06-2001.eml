Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to tas=
k=20
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so=20
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price=20
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just "Econ 101."=20
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the=20
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in=
=20
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with=20
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- =
a=20
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition t=
o=20
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and=20
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a "gang=
=20
of ten" economists including Alfred Kahn, "the architect of airline=20
deregulation under President Carter." But price caps don't work. As Presiden=
t=20
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, "[P]rice=20
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply."=20
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, w=
e=20
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway,=20
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose=20
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more=20
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his=20
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of=20
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and tim=
e=20
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will b=
e=20
"just enough" to call forth the right amount of new power. "Nobody," he=20
writes, "has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power=20
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce=20
the power supply?"
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn=20
that "strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applie=
s=20
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need=20
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually=20
lead to higher output." This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up=20
his hands and says "No point in me holding out for higher prices now that yo=
u=20
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And=20
which way is it to the airport?"
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that "That's not an=20
argument you want to use too often." In fact, the argument is dangerous=20
nonsense. There is no "monopoly" supplier of energy to California (although=20
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the=20
"commanding heights" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both=20
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as=20
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices=20
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have=
=20
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it=
=20
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that=20
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of=20
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing=
=20
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the=20
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective=20
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except=20
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that "generating=20
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut."=
=20
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for=20
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that=20
California's problems are all due to market "manipulation" by big energy=20
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide=20
assertion that President Bush's "knee-jerk ideologue" advisers may be "so=20
close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that=20
whatever is good for Enron is good for America." The presence in California=20
of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the=20
state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer=
,=20
Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise=20
campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business=20
executives somehow go together nicely.
