You may have noticed that you have not received updated shipper lists for th=
e last few weeks.  When the conversion was made to Windows 2000, Forest & Tr=
ees quit working.  Therefore, I am unable to produce the reports until this =
has been resolved. =20

I am working with Linda Trevino and Glen Stovall to fix the problem as soon =
as possible. =20

In the meantime, PLE is being updated to reflect changes as I receive them.
