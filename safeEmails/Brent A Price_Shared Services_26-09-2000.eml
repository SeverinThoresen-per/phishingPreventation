I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the=
=20
support services that Enron Europe is providing and how we
should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as=20
more efficient.   We will have a number of classic "centralized versus=20
decentralized" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Kee=
p=20
in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our=20
perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great=20
outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding=20
non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us i=
s=20
trying to massively expand our commercial business. =20

We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and=20
assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is=20
important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you.

Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in=
=20
Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well=20
such as:
IT development
IT infrastructure
RAC
Credit
Risk Management
Legal
Accounts Payable
Tax
Building Services
Analyst & Associate recruiting
Senior recruiting
Expat services
Other HR
PR
Governmental Relations
SFA relations
Finance

I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, bu=
t=20
that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for workin=
g
these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to ou=
r=20
upcoming meeting.

John
