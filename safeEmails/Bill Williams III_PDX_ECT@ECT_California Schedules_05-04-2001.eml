Group,

When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important =
guidelines to remember.

IMPORT-This must be FIRM.  A firm import is required so that we provide the =
spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the im=
port).  If the import is non-firm, California will charge us their price for=
 spinning reserve margins.  This could easily be $400 per mw come this summe=
r.


EXPORT-This must be NON-FIRM.  A non-firm export allows us to provide spinni=
ng reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy with=
out spinning reserves as "non-firm"), and NOT have to pay the California pri=
ce for spinning reserve margins.  Conversely if we do a firm export, we woul=
d have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves.  And because Calif=
ornia will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, this =
could easily be $400 per mw this summer.
California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a "firm" e=
xport does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than=
 nonfirm.

IF you have other questions.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
