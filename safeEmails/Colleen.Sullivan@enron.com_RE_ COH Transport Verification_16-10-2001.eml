Looking at the entire transport curve was very beneficial.  They have defini=
tely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame=
, which is representative of this type of retail market.  On average for the=
 season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable.  Let me know if=
 I can provide any other help.

John--
Thanks so much for the information you provided to me yesterday.  It was mos=
t helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their p=
rices and still feel they are appropriate).

Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a "market based" approach to=
 the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have pa=
id), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and=
 give feedback.  The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of=
 the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business.  Hope=
fully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their =
system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' cu=
rve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data th=
at I gave to you yesterday.

I'm trying to finalize COH's curve validation early next week, so let me kno=
w if you can get to it by then or not.  By the way, this would be much easie=
r if you'd just come to Retail and do the transport here...!!!

Thanks again for your help
