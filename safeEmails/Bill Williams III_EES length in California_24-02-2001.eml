We will be selling or buying length for EES each day going forward for marke=

we will then sell (or buy) as much of this energy as we can.  The deals need=
=20
to be put in the inc sheet,  EES will get the price -5.  We will then need t=
o=20
put the mws sold and the price they were sold at (-$5) in a summary sheet. =20
The summary sheet should then be sent to Neil Bresnan at EES each morning=20
(just like the EPE model).  The EES summary spread sheet is in=20

EES will provide us with a price number they do not want to go below, but=20
otherwise try to maximize the value of their energy.

In Enpower we will buy from Enron Energy Services (forward) and sell to the=20
counterparty (forward) under our book. In Caps, do the SC to SC interchange=20
