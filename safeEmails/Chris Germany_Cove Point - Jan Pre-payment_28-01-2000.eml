on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North Americ=

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the=20
counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment. =20
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the=20
counterparty. =20
