I wasn't sure if we needed to send out the report since it was a half holida=
y=20
for most companies, so i opted not to. I didn't send one Monday since it was=
=20
a nerc holiday.  Hopefully she won't call and give you shit about it. Plus w=
e=20
didnt have prices in so your guess is much better than mine as to what=20
actually happened.
Thanks
Chad
