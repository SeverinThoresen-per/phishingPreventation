Group,

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up ge=
nerators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday=
 morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave wi=
ll be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have =
everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, H=
E 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong wh=
en they switch to the back-up power.

Bill
