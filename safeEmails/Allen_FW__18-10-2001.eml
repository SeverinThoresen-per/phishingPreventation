Phillip:

The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day=
 to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with som=
e very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there al=
so appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storag=
e that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hop=
e to get some news via Technical Management Team today.

=46rom a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current r=
eservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by m=
onth end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storag=
e approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.

The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage i=
s available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, bu=
t probably earlier.

Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant in=
crease in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with in=
creased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.   =
 Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday:=
 In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting t=
o creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What=
 is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's infl=
ow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
