I would like to meet with you in order to lay out our plans for each of the =
groups within EnronOnline, specifically Origination.  While I plan to aggres=
sively look at expenses, my belief is that with a reduced staff our Originat=
ion team can create significant strategic and monetary value.  And since it'=
s becoming more apparent that EA will be paying the lion's share of EOL in 2=
002, your input into our plans is critical.  Please let me know if you have =
time on Monday before we need to finalize our headcount plans on Tuesday.

Thanks in advance,
Brad
