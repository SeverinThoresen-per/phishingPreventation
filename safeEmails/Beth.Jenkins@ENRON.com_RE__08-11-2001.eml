Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting tog=
ether for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game ti=
me is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).=
  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to ki=
ck-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricane=
s.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass.=
=20

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your ki=
ds if you have them.
