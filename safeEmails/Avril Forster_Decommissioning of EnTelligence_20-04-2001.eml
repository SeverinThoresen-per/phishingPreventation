Dear EnTelligence user,

Effective April 30th, 2001 the EnTelligence system will be taken permanently=

data maintenance and development costs. We recognize that you were a user of=
=20
the system, but trust that you understand the economic motivation behind thi=
s=20
decision. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any=
=20
concerns or wish to comment on this action, please contact myself on=20
extension 5-8768.

If you have any requirements for adhoc reporting, please contact our Helplin=
e=20
at extension 3-3147 or email your request to: entelligence@enron.com.=20
Requests must be received prior to April 28th, in order to be processed prio=
r=20
to closure of the system.

The Global Data Management group (James Scribner, extension 3-9641) will be=20
maintaining a reduced relationship with Dun & Bradstreet.  If you need=20
assistance in requesting data from D&B similar to which was maintained by=20
EnTelligence, James will be available to assist you in your discussions with=
=20
D&B.
