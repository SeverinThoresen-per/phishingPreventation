With respect to my assignments  JP Morgan and Dominion -

There is apparently some confusion regarding whether a Master Netting Agreem=
ent should be prepared for the J.P. Morgan group or for the Morgan Stanley g=
roup.  We have been unable to obtain confirmation regarding the correct enti=
ties. =20

For Dominion, I await the Master Physical agreements from Canada and the cre=
dit information from Credit.  Other agreements have been reviewed and the fo=
rm of Master Netting Agreement marked up with the information available.
