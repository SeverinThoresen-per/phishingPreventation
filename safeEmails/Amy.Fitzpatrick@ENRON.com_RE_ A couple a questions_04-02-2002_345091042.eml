We don't have them here, but I will call Stamford and see what I can do.

Thanks!

I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into=
 the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case =
something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have=
 for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my =

t by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)
