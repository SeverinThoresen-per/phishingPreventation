We used a pediatrician in Tomball, Dr. Carr.  Dawn liked him quite well (and=
=20
I did too), but it's a bit of a drive.  I could ask my wife for other names?

I'm pulling my hair out with moving details - bank accounts, leases,=20
shipments, tax forms ...  Sara tells me legal is pretty thin these days. =20
Credit is the same in Houston.  Tracey is moving to Portland, Christopher=20
left and John is moving to the Market Risk Group.  I got out just in time.
