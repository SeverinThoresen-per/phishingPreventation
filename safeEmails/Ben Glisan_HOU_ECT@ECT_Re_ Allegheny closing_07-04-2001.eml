Thanks for the note.  The concern was not over the timing of the receipt of =
funds but rather a comment which implied that Allegheny needed to raise the =
funds through an equity offering.  Is that a fair characterization and, if s=
o, do you have any concerns over Allegheny's short term access to capital (i=
=2Ee. what is their funding strategy if the equity markets continue to be ro=
cky).  My concern is heightened by the bankruptcy filing of PCG which will m=
ost likely create a fair amount of volatility through the utility sector.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning a=
t your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have =
set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,=
000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a =
build out of a sub station.=20

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Don
