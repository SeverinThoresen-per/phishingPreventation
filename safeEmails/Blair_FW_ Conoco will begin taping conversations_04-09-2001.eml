We received the following communication Dated August 29, 2001 from Conoco:

"In an effort to improve the quality of our services and consistent with pra=
ctices, Conoco Gas and Power Marketing, a division of Conoco, Inc. has insta=
lled equipment to record telephone conversations with our customers and trad=
ing partners.  These recordings will benefit us all by verifying the accurac=
y of our verbal agreements and reducing the chance for miscommunication.

atically and continue throughout the conversation.  There will be no notice =
or recording indicator. =20

Please call me if you have any questions about this arrangement.  We appreci=
