Let me know how you want me to handle, but I knew I would get screwed on thi=
s.

Do you think I should play hard ball with them.  Mike has already emailed me=
 and said that he will try to work on them from his end.

I need him to start getting involved with EES to offload Scott and really pr=
ogress the strategic system side,  and with more Risk people on the table no=
w in Houston, I would think that if London can't give him up, then maybe we =
should consider another option with someone from EIM or EGM.

Let me know what you think

I have been speaking with Matthew regarding the "work-out" plan for EBS in E=
uorope and it looks as though he'll require my services here in London up un=
til beginning of Jan-02.

There are a number of options we are currently looking at, but all of them s=
till require a large amount of work.

As I was originally due to fly to the US in the first week of December and f=
ly back for Chistmas, I'm only really missing out on about 10 working days i=
n EES.

Given the status of the "work-out" plan I do not want to leave EBS in it's c=
urrent unfinished state. Potentially there is a $17m write/off and due to th=
e lack of historic knowledge regarding EBS, I consider myself a key individu=
al in minimising this exposure - I have spoken to Mike Jordan and he fully s=
upports a Jan-02 being most beneficial to Enron as a whole.

Does this work for you ?

Thanks

Neil
