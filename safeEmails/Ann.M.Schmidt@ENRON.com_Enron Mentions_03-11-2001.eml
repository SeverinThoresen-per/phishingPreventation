Under the Radar: Enron's Only White Knight Is Itself

There is no suitor-in-waiting for Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20
Despite a speculation-filled week, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK^=
A:NYSE - news - commentary) probably isn't waiting in the wings to gobble up=
 the troubled energy giant. The risk profile doesn't fit Royal Dutch Shell (=
RD:NYSE - news - commentary) , and it's unlikely General Electric (GE:NYSE -=
 news - commentary) is ready to jump at the chance to rescue the Houston ene=
rgy firm from its troubles with the SEC and disgruntled investors.=20
And while the recent slide in Enron's stock price might seem to make it an a=
ttractive target, it's implausible that an Enron competitor would step up to=
 the plate and make an offer to acquire its troubled peer.=20
"We do not believe there is a high probability of a bailout offer at a price=
 significantly above the current price, as there is too much uncertainty abo=
ut the capital structure and shareholder lawsuits," says Jeff Dietert, indep=
endent power analyst at Simmons & Co., a Houston energy investment firm and =
a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable.=20
Many metrics suggest the stock is inexpensive. Merrill Lynch analyst Donato =
Eassey recently calculated Enron's asset value to be between $16 and $24 per=
 share, which may make Enron's current price of less than $12 look cheap. Bu=
t in nearly the same breath, Eassey downgraded Enron stock to neutral from "=
accumulate." Merrill Lynch has provided banking services for Enron.=20
"While we have not altered our view of Enron's fundamentals or its ability t=
o weather this long-term storm, from a practical standpoint we believe noise=
 surrounding the SEC's move to a formal investigation will outweigh any [ear=
nings] analysis or net asset value calculation," Eassey told clients in a re=
port Thursday.=20
For Buffett: Intriguing But ...
Reports that famed value investor Warren Buffett is looking at Enron may be =
correct. He is an opportunistic investor and has an interest in the power bu=
siness. And, Berkshire's ownership of Mid-American Energy provides a platfor=
m for an Enron deal.=20
However, interest and action are two different things. While Buffett has sai=
d he wants additional power holdings, he seems more focused on the tradition=
al, regulated utilities rather than the more aggressive opportunities repres=
ented by Enron. Buffett's track record shows he craves certainty and that is=
 something Enron can't provide, especially now.=20
There are also pragmatic issues. If Enron considered a deal, it would have t=
o be one that was both rich and immediate, something Buffett can't offer. Co=
nstrained by the Public Utility Holding Company Act, or PUHCA, Berkshire mig=
ht not be able to purchase Enron until the sale of Portland General, the Ore=
gon utility, is completed sometime next year.=20
The Enron culture could also keep Buffett away. Enron is well known for its =
employee stock option program that made millions of dollars for people like =
ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling while creating little value for shareholders. Buffet=
t is a tireless critic of such shenanigans. Buffett also generally looks for=
 companies with a management team committed to remaining in place, and Ken L=
ay has no desire to remain at the helm of Enron for the long haul, and futur=
e leadership is uncertain.=20
And while Buffett still may take a look, price could be the ultimate stumbli=
ng block. "I think he understands the derivative trading business better tha=
n most," says Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager of the Legg Mason Focus Tru=
st and author of The Essential Buffett: Timeless Principles for the New Econ=
omy. "I wouldn't be surprised if it's caught his eye, but I don't think he w=
ould get his price. He won't pay a premium for Enron."=20
As for Buffett, he won't comment on anything, let alone rumors like this.=20
Shell: Burned Out on Gas?
Another rumored suitor is Royal Dutch Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) . =
Speculation has escalated to the point of suggesting that Shell and Enron ha=
ve signed a confidentiality agreement to allow for exchange of privileged fi=
nancial data.=20
A Shell spokeswoman in London would not comment on the speculation. An Enron=
 spokesman also declined to comment.=20
Shell wants to expand its gas business and in its bid for Barrett Resources,=
 showed it will pay a premium for the right assets.=20
But Enron is more an energy trading company than an exploration and producti=
on company. Shell's problems growing both its Coral trading subsidiary and i=
ts Tejas Gas unit -- a costly acquisition -- probably would make it shy away=
 from going there again, Dietert says.=20
Shell and Enron are very different companies, he adds. "Culturally, it's a t=
ough deal to imagine."=20
GE Capital: Enlightened Investor?
The final name bandied about is GE Capital. This one is more difficult to fi=
gure, but an investment in Enron by the finance unit of General Electric isn=
't out of the question. However, sources tell me an outright bid is unlikely=
=2E=20
"They are a potential investor," says Dietert. "If push comes to shove, Enro=
n would be willing to issue 30% to 40% more equity rather than face bankrupt=
cy. And, GE Capital could participate in such a deal."=20
However, any move is just speculation at this point. And General Electric wo=
n't comment on speculation.=20
Even if an offer for Enron emerged, price would clearly be an issue. Current=
 uncertainty suggests any offer would be well below a price Enron would cons=
ider reasonable. Hence, while a bid for Enron isn't out of the question, it'=
s likely Enron will stand to fight its current battles alone.=20


BANDWIDTH BEAT: Playing '20 Questions' With Enron Execs
By Michael Rieke

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Since Enron Corp. (ENE) is such a hot topic these days=
, here's a suggestion for a new game.
If you worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission, with its subpoena =
powers, what questions would you ask in your current investigation of Enron?=
=20
You could even break it down into categories, like the game show "Jeopardy."=
=20
The first category is Enron trading counterparties run by Enron executives.=20
How many of those counterparties were run by Enron employees such as former =
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and Michael Kopper, a former managing =
director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group?=20
We know that Fastow ran two private investment companies that Enron traded w=
ith - LJM Cayman and LJM2 Cayman. Kopper ran one called Chewco Investments=20
What does LJM stand for? (If you know that answer to that one, you're ahead =
of an Enron spokeswoman who told Bandwidth Beat that she didn't know what th=
e letters stood for.)=20
Sometimes companies use letters that are actually initials of investors name=
s. Are any of the investors in the LJM partnerships an Enron executive whose=
 last name starts with L, J or M? (The Enron spokeswoman hasn't called back =
with an answer to that one either.)=20
Who was meant to profit and who was meant to lose in Enron's complicated fin=
ancial transactions with the LJM partnerships and others?=20
If the partnerships were meant to profit, what will Enron's shareholders (an=
d their class-action lawsuit attorneys) have to say about it?=20
If Enron was meant to profit from the transactions, was it because the deals=
 allowed the company to hide underperforming assets, making its quarterly re=
ports look better? If the answer to that question is yes, what will Enron's =
shareholders (and their class-action lawsuit attorneys) have to say about it=
?=20
A related category might be geography. Start with an easy one: In what body =
of water are the Cayman Islands located?=20
Then move to more interesting questions. Why were the two LJM private invest=
ment partnerships located in the Caymans? Does it have anything to do with t=
he fact that the Caymans are a tax-free jurisdiction even for non-residents?=
 Does it have anything to do with the strict confidentiality laws governing =
business transactions there?=20
The next category is politics. Again, start with an easy one: How much money=
 did Enron Chairman Ken Lay give to George W. Bush's presidential campaign f=
und? (That one is easy because, by law, the limit is $1,000 per person for h=
ard money contributions.)=20
How much soft money did Lay and Enron each give to the Republican Party duri=
ng the 1999-2000 campaign cycle?=20
How much did Lay give to Bush's presidential primary campaign fund? (That on=
e is more difficult. Bush decided not to accept government matching funds fo=
r his primary campaign, so there wasn't any limit on individual contribution=
s.)=20
How much money did Ken Lay help raise for Bush's presidential primary campai=
gn? (Here's a hint: He was a member of the Bush Pioneers, each of whom pledg=
ed to raise at least $100,000 for the fund.)=20
Still in the politics category, how much will those campaign contributions a=
ffect the current SEC investigation of Enron? (That's another easy one. All =
contributors to political campaigns will tell you that they expect nothing i=
n return.)=20
Now for the history category. In an April conference call with analysts, who=
 was the analyst who criticized Enron for not disclosing enough information =
about its finances?=20
What expletive did Enron's former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling call the ana=
lyst? (Here's a hint: In reporting the name-calling incident, a radio newsma=
n said Skilling had "called the analyst a type of hole.")=20
At the time, Skilling said the analyst was a "short-seller." That means the =
analyst had borrowed Enron stock and sold it, expecting the share price to d=
ecline over time. He then would buy it back at a lower price and make a prof=
it.=20
If that investment strategy qualified the analyst to be called a particular =
type of hole, what do you call the Enron executives who have sold more than =
$500 million in company shares since Jan. 1, 2000?=20
In answering that question, remember that short-sellers have to buy the stoc=
k back at some point in order to make money. Also remember that the Enron ex=
ecutives didn't have to buy back any of the stock they sold.=20
Join in the fun. If you want to play and have questions to add to the list, =
refer to the e-mail address and phone number below.=20

USA: Stung Californians not crowing at Enron's troubles.
By Leonard Anderson

11/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - If there's one market that might applaud th=
e mounting financial woes facing energy giant Enron Corp., it's California, =
whose power sector was shattered by the market deregulation that Enron tirel=
essly champions.=20
Last summer, angry Californians tossed a pie at Enron ex-Chief Executive Jef=
f Skilling during a speech here in which he blamed state regulators for caus=
ing the energy crisis.
California officials, led by Governor Gray Davis, blasted Houston-based Enro=
n and other out-of-state power companies for creating the emergency, accusin=
g them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices.=20
But with Enron now facing a credit crunch and a full-scale probe by U.S. reg=
ulators into questionable financial dealings, California officials are holdi=
ng back their harshest criticism, saying instead there are lessons to be lea=
rned from Enron's predicament.=20
And some of Enron's toughest critics, among them Davis and Loretta Lynch, pr=
esident of the state's Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), would not discuss=
 the company's woes.=20
"You reap what you sow, but I don't think anyone wants to pile on them right=
 now," said a state government source.=20
Many Californians cited ongoing business and creditor links with Enron as re=
asons not to hurl stones at the energy giant.=20
Enron is by far the nation's largest trader of electricity and natural gas, =
with energy analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily t=
rade in those markets.=20
Transactions on the company's widely watched Internet-based EnronOnline trad=
ing system are estimated currently to average $3 billion to $4 billion a day=
=2E=20
'BUSINESS CYCLES'=20
"Business cycles come and go," said Greg Pruett, spokesman for San Francisco=
-based energy company PG&E Corp. , whose Pacific Gas & Electric unit, Califo=
rnia's biggest utility, filed for federal bankruptcy protection in April in =
the wake of the energy mess.=20
"We are wrestling with our own situation, and you can appreciate what Enron =
is going through. We have done business with Enron for a long time and will =
continue to do business with them in the future," Pruett said.=20
California's power agencies, forced into buying emergency electricity for th=
e state earlier this year when the state's investor-owned utilities ran out =
of credit and cash, said they have financial ties with Enron.=20
"Their situation is not ringing alarm bells for us," said Gregg Fishman, a s=
pokesman for the Independent System Operator (ISO), which manages the state =
power grid.=20
The ISO owes Enron money for purchases of daily power supplies but Fishman d=
eclined to say how much.=20
Aside from a 30-day supply contract earlier this year, Enron does not have a=
ny current power deals with the state's Department of Water Resources, said =
Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the agency which negotiates long-term agreement=
s.=20
One top California energy regulator, however, said Enron's troubles offer an=
 important lesson for energy markets.=20
Carl Wood, a CPUC commissioner, said the deregulation of markets for basic s=
ervices like electricity "threatens as much financial volatility and instabi=
lity as we have seen in the telecommunications and the dot-com industries."=20
Wood said, "Enron is the flagship for deregulation, but there are definite d=
angers of venturing into unregulated market behavior. Enron itself apparentl=
y is becoming a victim of sorts. Our largest utility is in bankruptcy. One o=
bvious conclusion is to keep the energy industry on a pretty short regulator=
y leash."=20
"The unregulated energy industry rises faster, but it also falls further," s=
aid Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer Rights, an advo=
cacy group in Santa Monica, California.=20
"It's okay for a free market to operate for things like computers and other =
goods but energy is different. Regulatory structures are needed to protect c=
ustomers," he said.

Enron Portland Genl Sale Seen Going Smoothly This Time
By Jessica Berthold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp's (ENE) current troubles won't jeopardi=
ze its $1.8 billion sale of utility Portland General Electric to Northwest N=
atural Gas Co. (NWN), analysts and the companies said.=20
In contrast to Enron's previous attempt to sell the utility to Sierra Pacifi=
c Resources (SRP), which foundered earlier this year on regulatory issues, t=
he sale to the Portland, Ore.-based gas utility is expected to go smoothly.
It will need to, as Enron has said it is counting on sales of assets, includ=
ing Portland General, to pay off $3.3 billion in notes coming due during the=
 next 20 months.=20
"Enron has wanted out of this asset for a very long time," said Susan Abbott=
, an analyst with Moody's Investor Services. "Right now, they need to sell s=
ome assets, and this would be a larger one that would give them some cash."=20
The energy giant's shares have lost about two-thirds of their value in the p=
ast three weeks and its credit ratings have been downgraded to within two st=
eps of noninvestment grade levels due to uncertainties about its extremely c=
omplex financial structure.=20
Those uncertainties were sparked Enron's $1.2 billion reduction in sharehold=
er equity related to transactions with entities headed by former Chief Finan=
cial Officer Andrew Fastow. The notes coming due are also related to those e=
ntities. Enron's dealings with those entities are the subject of an investig=
ation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have raised investor ha=
ckles over a perceived lack of transparency.=20
Analysts said none of this will change plans for the Portland General sale -=
 which will bring Enron $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in Northwest Nat=
ural Gas preferred stock, and $50 million in common stock.=20
Earlier Problems Not Seen Repeated=20

In April, a two-year old deal to sell the utility to Nevada company Sierra P=
acific Resources (SRP) for $2 billion collapsed due to changes in that state=
's laws that would have forbidden the utility's recovery of power costs if t=
he sale went through. The deal had already been doomed for months due to Sie=
rra Pacific's tenuous financial position.=20
But Northwest Natural's financial house is in order, and there is no apparen=
t law or regulation that threatens to block the deal in Oregon or Washington=
, the two states where approval is needed, analysts said.=20
"Northwest Natural is very well-regarded by regulators in both states, and I=
 think there's quite a bit of interest on the part of regulators to have the=
 utility in local hands as opposed to somewhere down in Texas," said Gerald =
Keenan, utility analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers.=20
Concerns about the quality of Enron's credit may encourage state regulators =
to act more quickly on the sale, an analyst said.=20
"If I were a regulator, I'd be much more interested in having Portland Gener=
al out from under Enron," the analyst said.=20
The Oregon Public Utilities Commission hopes to expedite its review of the s=
ale so that it is complete in six months, rather than the usual 10, commissi=
on spokesman Bob Valdez said.=20
"Given the fact that we are familiar with the management and regulatory affa=
irs of both companies and have dealt with them extensively, we hope it will =
take no longer than six months," said Valdez, adding that the commission exp=
ected to receive a filing on the sale Nov. 7.=20
The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission hasn't received a fil=
ing, but once it does there is no statutory time limit on review, a spokeswo=
man said.=20
Federal Review Seen Uneventful=20

In addition to Oregon and Washington utilities regulators, the sale must be =
approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Securities an=
d Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of =
Justice and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.=20
None has received filings yet on the sale, which is slated for completion in=
 the fourth quarter of 2002.=20
"We are shooting for mid-November as far as submitting our request to the st=
ate commissions," Northwest Natural Gas spokesman Steve Sechrist said. "Thos=
e will be the first major hurdle, then we'll move on to the federal filings.=
"=20
Shareholders must also approve the acquisition. They will likely vote in spr=
ing of 2002, Sechrist said.=20
Northwest Natural, Enron and analysts said they don't expect hangups at the =
federal level.=20
The only thing that might create a problem for the sale, Keenan said, would =
be a "significant deterioration" of the natural gas or electricity markets h=
arming the companies. Right now, however, things look good on that front.=20
"The market is much more stable than it was when Sierra Pacific tried to buy=
 the utility. And the deal is much more practical this time: the price is lo=
wer and the terms are better," he said. "Clearly it's important for Enron to=
 be able to get this done, and I think they will."=20

Nymex/Lowers Costs -2: Retroactive To Thurs Transactions

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest=
 energy futures marketplace, said Friday it lowered the cost of exchange-of-=
futures-for-swaps transactions retroactive to Thursday, when the new instrum=
ents were introduced.=20
In a press release Friday, Nymex said it cut the cost of EFS transactions to=
 $2.50 a contract per side from $10 a contract per side.
The exchange introduced the contracts in its natural gas futures market Thur=
sday, in a move the trading community saw as an attempt by Nymex to grab mar=
ket share from Enron Corp. (ENE) by extending its clearing services to the o=
ver-the-counter market for natural gas derivatives.=20
Enron, which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power and gas marke=
ts, has seen its creditworthiness questioned as a result of complicated fina=
ncial dealings that led to a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity, a=
 65% drop in the company's stock in two weeks and an investigation by the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission.=20
In the first full day of trading on Nymex, 11,000 EFS contracts changed hand=
s, Nymex said.=20
EFS transactions are similar to exchange-of-futures-for-physicals, or EFP, t=
ransactions. Two parties will privately negotiate integrated over-the-counte=
r swaps and a related futures transaction. The transaction must involve appr=
oximately equal, but opposite, side-of-market quantities of futures and swap=
 exposures in commodities that are similar or related.=20
The EFS transactions will be allowed to liquidate, initiate and transfer mar=
ket positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.=20
