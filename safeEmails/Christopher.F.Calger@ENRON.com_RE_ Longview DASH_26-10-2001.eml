The exposure goes up $3MM-$5MM per month up to the equipment contract cost o=
f $67MM for an incremental DASH of approx $49MM (with interest).  Chip and I=
 talked about approving the full amount, but checking monthly with you and h=

DASH 2 more months now and formally evaluate our position at year-end.=20

Louise,

Chip will want to talk with you about the Longview equipment.  We are circul=
ating a DASH to enable us to continue making payments.  If we do not continu=
e to make payments, we forfeit the equipment and take a $23MM hit.  This is =
approximately 35% of the total equipment contract.  I think the equipment is=
 worth more (than 65%) and I believe that we will get out of this problem wi=
th less than a $22MM hit.  I therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ =
for this equipment.  It will continue to be funded off B/S. =20

We continue to have discussions/negotiations with Calpine, NRG and TransAlta=
=2E  We have also opened up general equipment discussions with Mirant and AE=
S. =20
