Subject: Proposed new Index



Index:  Gas Daily WAHA
Abbreviation: Waha
Sort Code: 3530


The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint=20
prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey=
"=20
in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas Daily, or if=
=20
a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such calendar day=20
will be the [average of the Common High and Common Low] DAILY MIDPOINT price=
=20
published on the next succeeding Business Day.

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized? It's not capitalized in=20
the Gas Daily publication - so to consistent with the publication I did not=20
capitalize.
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average =
-=20
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also. See above.
