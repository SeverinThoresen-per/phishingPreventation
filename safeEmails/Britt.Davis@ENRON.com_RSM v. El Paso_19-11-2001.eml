	Marianne,

	This will confirm our conference regarding your further due diligence.  Her=
e are the to-do's:

	1.  You will call Steve Schneider and anyone else you need to to find out w=
hether a database still exists that captures all ENA-related sale and/or tra=
nsport contracts for Zapata county from 1980-1995.

	2.  With regard to the Zapata County meter numbers listed in the PCS Synerg=
i database document that you showed me, which reflects all ENA-related purch=
ase contracts from 1980-1995, you will double-check to make sure that there =
is no evidence of any purchase contract listing Enron Corp., Intratex or EGM=
 as a counterparty.  If there is, you will research whether there was any ev=
idence of actual purchase activity under any of these meters. With regard to=
 the meters shown on that document, both "off-system" and "on-system", you w=
ill research who owned or operated them.

	3.  With regard to the Zapata County contracts in the new Global system, wh=
ich shows all ENA-related purchase, sale or transportation contracts from 19=
99 forward, you will research the contracts that do appear to show ENA as a =
counter-party for actual purchase activity and at what meters.  Also, since =
the report you drew up does not show meter numbers, you will drill down for =
those as well, and see if there are any meters in addition to those shown in=
 the PCS Synergi document.  If there are, you will research the identity of =
those as well.

	Please keep me closely advised.

	Britt
