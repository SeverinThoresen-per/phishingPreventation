 Louise,

Summary and Notes:

Roseville:
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost
NOX		51		$21.5		$1.1MM
VOC		187		$27.5		$5.2MM
SOX		56		$6		$0.3MM
PM10		362		$29		$10.6MM	=09
Options:					$0.5MM

San Joaquin:=09
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost=09
NOX		326		$21		$6.9MM
VOC		22		$7.5		$0.2MM
SOX		36		$6		$0.2MM
Total:						$7.3MM

Bay Area:
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost
Various		46		$11		$0.5MM


Total:						$25.5MM


- San Joaquin could be sold for a $3MM - $6MM gain; we are proceeding with C=
alpine, Cantor and Enron desk.
- Sale of Roseville and Bay Area ERC's would result in a significant discoun=
t (40%-50%) because the air districts would be upset - basically, they could=
 apply a transfer discount to the credits of 15%-25% and also could make fut=
ure transfers conditional upon their approval (increasing risk for buyer). =20
- Sale would also cause collateral damage to any future ERC activities (Enro=
n would be seen as speculator/carpetbagger)

Recommendation:
Pursue sale of San Joaquin credits and put the balance in the global finance=
 funding vehicle.  Initial indication is that transfer of credits for financ=
e purposes is easy for an air district to accept.  I am setting up a call to=
 discuss with finance, legal and Kelly Brodbeck. =20
