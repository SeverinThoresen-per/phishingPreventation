Chris,
=20
The Performing/Non-Performing separation for power was not even done until m=
id-Jan, so there is no way to provide p&l on the comparative positions back =
in Dec.  Basically, our MTD, QTD and YTD p&l is all the same amount.
=20
Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks!
Casey

Several groups have asked about the "11/30 to date" column on the DPR and wh=
at should be included in that number.  The intent was to report the p&l acti=
vity since Enron filed for bankruptcy, therefore including December p&l and =
January to date p&l, for the current DPR.  However, the question of whether =
we have the ability to include December's p&l is open.  The report should no=
t include active deals which we do not intend to perform on, but those deals=
 may not have been removed by the end of December from everyone's p&l. =20
=20
Please let me know if this is the case for your books.

Thanks,
Chris

To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the atta=
ched spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solu=
tion and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline rep=
orting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noo=
n each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&=
l and PRMA.
=20
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that=
 we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured,=
 and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that =
as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.  =20
