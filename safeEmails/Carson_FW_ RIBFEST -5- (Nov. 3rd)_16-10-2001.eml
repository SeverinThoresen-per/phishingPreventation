The World Wide RibFest "celebration of the Rib" is coming up.  This will be =
the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend =
the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a =
tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the f=
ormer Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque =
competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby =
Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting th=
em here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often th=
e crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not=
 officially recognized by the sanctioning body). =20

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margari=
tas, what else will be served?"
			          I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."=09
		               She replies:	"No."=20

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appeti=
zers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The co=
mpetition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the you=
ng and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competi=
tion is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadc=
ast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bel=
laire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the compet=
ition this year citing "personal reasons"

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging =
takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
	=09
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
=46rom downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournac=
e exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the l=
amppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the B=
isonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that buildi=
ng is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm S=
treet. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a c=
lue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'=
ll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the b=
etter.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to co=
ncentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.
