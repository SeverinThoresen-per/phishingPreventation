Kay,

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea wa=
s that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I ha=
d lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  =
I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opi=
nion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not impor=
tant.

On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very a=
nxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Eac=
h day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try =
and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is k=
ind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their we=
bsite at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.sh=
tml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs =
about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if y=
ou can find her.

Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem t=
o do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.=
  See you soon.

Keith
