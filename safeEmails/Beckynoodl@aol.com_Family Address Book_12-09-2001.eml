Hello to all!

Here is the promised email address book. =A0There are still people missing, =
but=20
it's a pretty good start. =A0I will volunteer to be the keeper of the master=
=20
list for a while, and will send out updates monthly or when needed to=20
everyone. =A0If there is anyone missing from the email list or something nee=
ds=20
to be changed, please send it to me. =A0If I should ever go back to work, I=20
will find a volunteer in the family to be the master keeper of the list.  I=20
did receive an error on Vern, Brad and Greg when sending this email. =20
Hopefully someone can send me their correct email address.

I put this address book together to accomplish two things. =A0First, I am=20
writing a family cookbook so I need to be able to communicate individually=20
with all of you. =A0More on that later. =A0Second, this should give the guys=
=20
putting together the next reunion a little easier way to correspond with the=
=20
family rather that having to mail to everyone. =A0This way they only have to=
=20
mail to those not on the list.

Now, for what this list is not for. =A0This is not for any of you to send gr=
oup=20
emails for jokes and cartoons, or chain letters. =A0Some of the people on th=
is=20
list have given work email addresses. =A0They cannot receive improper emails=
=20
(especially if you work for the ATF). =A0If any of you do start receiving=20
unwanted emails, please let that person know immediately to stop. =A0=A0If t=
hey=20
do not stop, please let me know and we will remove them from the family emai=
l=20
list. =A0

Thanks to all of you that helped me to get this information.  I am still=20
working on getting more addresses, so let me know if you have any.

For those of you that haven't heard this yet, I am trying to write a family=20
cookbook.  I am hoping to get the recipes for everything our parents used to=
=20
make for us while we were growing up.  I also want to get three or four of=20
your own favorite recipes from each cousin.  There will be other nice tidbit=
s=20
in the cookbook about everyone, maybe a story from when you were growing up?=
 =20
Or even something current in your life.  I will not send out mass emails ver=
y=20
often.  I will be talking individually to each of you over the next couple o=
f=20
months.  So for any of you that just can't wait for that individual contact,=
=20
please send your recipes in now.  Bill Billinger is sending his this week, I=
=20
think?

This is exciting to me to get this address book out to all of you.  This is=20
such an awesome family, and I love the fact that I can stay in touch with al=
l=20
of you.  If you need to call me, my phone number is 303-773-6021.

Love you all!
Becky
