Louise:

I unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as I was in=
terviewing analyst candidates, however the overall reaction from the group s=
eems to be positive and I applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone.

I realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidit=
y and therefore I felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to=
 a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the curren=
t situation.  Since most of our activities seem to require some amount of ca=
pital, I was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn C=
arl Tricoli's prepay concept for IPP's on its head and reverse the transacti=
on with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and =
deliver power in the future.  Assuming we can find the right counterparties,=
 then we in essence would achieve a short position (which seems to be more i=
n line with your strategic thoughts) and pick up liquidity in the short run.

Regards,

Charlie
