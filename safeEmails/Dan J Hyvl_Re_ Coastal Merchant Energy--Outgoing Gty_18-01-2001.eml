Russell,
 Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are=20
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the th=
e=20
guarantee, incoming or outgoing. =20
 Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enro=
n=20
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company=
=20
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's=
=20
new parent will need to take its place. =20
 Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee wil=
l=20
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this=20
takes the action of their spun off entity.

Clement,
 Do you agree?

Clement, Dan,

Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the=20
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec..=20
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not=
=20
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accep=
t=20
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally though=
t=20
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: RE: Pending Guaranty for Physical Business




Russell,=20

We looked at the revised redline on the Enron physical business sent by you=20
on Dec 21st 00.=20

We have the following important comments:=20

(1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be=
=20
covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master=20
Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been=
=20
signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not=20
probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefor=
e=20
we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligation=
s=20
of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).

(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and=20
sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had=
=20
requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Ca=
p=20
be set for all entities.?=20

(3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will=20
supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage=20
Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage=20
Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed=20
Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph ("insofar=
=20
as it respects Contract Party").? This was deleted in your revised redline.

We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, i=
f=20
it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.

Please respond at your earliest convenience.=20

Thanks=20
Kiran=20
