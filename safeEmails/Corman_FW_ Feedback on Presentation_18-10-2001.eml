I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part =
where he copied Stan.

This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to P=
hil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold"=
 on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......

Looking over my notes from the Operations Directors Conference, I am reminde=
d of what a fine job you did delivering your presentation and I thought I'd =
provide you this feedback.

I felt you clearly conveyed your information in a manner that engaged the pa=
rticipants and helped them understand and retain your message.  Specifically=
, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctl=
y with varying voice inflection and without "umms" (a very difficult thing t=
o do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in you=
r voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  W=
atching and listening, I both "liked" you and felt "sold" on the seriousness=
 of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providin=
g effective customer service.

To improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing=
 the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become "bu=
sy" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets =
past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any on=
e slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more =
slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their ret=
ention.

Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpf=
ul new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were v=
ery effective.

Regards,
- Roger

expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went =
just as well!)
