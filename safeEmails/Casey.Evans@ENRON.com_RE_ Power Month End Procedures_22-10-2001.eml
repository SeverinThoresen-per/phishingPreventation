Everything is usually dated as of the last business day.  We definitely publ=
ish and export as of the last business day, and usually, we just do a file s=
ave as of the dpr as of the last day of the month.  All clear?!

Casey,

Can you remind me of all this?

Thanks,

John,

Good questions, when I figure it out I will add to the Month End Procedures.

Just as confirmation, is the last pwrdpr for the month dated as the last bus=
iness day or the day of the calculation? Also, do we export for the last bus=
iness day or the effective date?

In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the=
 procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyo=
ne I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


=B7	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effectiv=
e the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
=B7	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is per=
formed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were =
produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was pe=
rformed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculati=
on).
=B7	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last busine=
ss day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation t=
imetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the ef=
fective dates of the calculation. =20

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at mo=
nth end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick=
 up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal pro=
cedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact Port=
Calc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated =
the last day of the month.
