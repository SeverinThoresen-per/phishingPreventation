I am told ISO hosts media calls on occasion during emergencies where they ta=
lk about system conditions with the media.  I have asked CAISO to be notifie=
d of such calls.  If you are interested in knowing about such calls or liste=
ning in, please let me know.

If you would like an email sent to you anytime a Stage 1/2/3 is called, sign=
 up on www.incident.com.  This site was recommended to me by the CAISO media=
 rep.
