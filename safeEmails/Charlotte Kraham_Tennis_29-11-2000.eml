Hey.

Hear that you didn't get to hit with Dan on Monday but instead got a few=20
games of doubles under your belt.  How did that go?

I was wondering if you wanted to hit on Thursday either during lunch or afte=
r=20
work.  I usually have a meeting during lunch on Thursday but heard it might=20
be cancelled.  I am going to be up at the Met this evening and will book a=20
court if you want to hit during either times.  I will just have to get back=20
with you if you want to hit during lunch to let you know if we have our=20
meeting or not.

Talk to you soon.

Char
