Toronto-based Mark Schmeer, managing director of equities at money manager=20
Elliott & Page, says the Standard & Poor's 500 index could generate a=20
double-digit total return over the next 12 months as the U.S. economy grows=20
about 2% to 3%.=20
If this forecast is correct -- "by various measures the U.S. economy has=20

technology sector, he says. "Growth stocks do well in a climate of=20
accelerating economic growth and a rising stock market." This suggests, he=20
says, that investors should consider revisiting the battered tech sector,=20
"but not indiscriminately."
While he is bullish on the outlook for the equity market over the next 12=20
months, Schmeer warns that there will continue to be volatility.=20
Schmeer and his team have assembled a comprehensive corporate data base that=

In stock selection, the Elliott & Page team uses both traditional fundamenta=

For the column, Schmeer is selecting stocks from a number of sectors. His=20
tech pick:=20
- BEA Systems Inc. (BEAS/NASDAQ), which closed recently at US$24.52 and=20
trades in a 52-week range of US$89.50 to US$20.19.=20
The stock is substantially off its 52-week high and has declined more than=20

Unlike many other tech companies, BEA has been keeping up its earnings growt=

do so, Schmeer says. Earnings per share estimates are US42 cents for the=20
fiscal year to January, 2002, and US64 cents for the fiscal year to January,=

2003. This makes for an earnings growth rate of around 50%. The stock trades=

fourth quarter this year, he says.=20
Schmeer's picks in the consumer products sector include:=20
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ/NYSE) US$54.91 (US$54.98- US$40.25). This health=20

notes. "This is not a cheap stock, but you are paying for the consistency in=

earnings growth; the company should continue to deliver on its earnings."=20
J and J recently purchased ALZA Corp., a drug delivery company based in=20

Finally, this manager is choosing a rapidly expanding savings and loan=20

SACRAMENTO -- Facing criticism over possible conflicts of interest, Davis=20
administration officials on Wednesday ordered consultants steering Californi=
a=20
through the energy crisis to sell off stock they own in power firms--or lose=
=20
their jobs.=20
A top legal aide to Gov. Gray Davis said private consultants who were hangin=
g=20
on to power company stock had failed to uphold the state's highest ethical=20
standards.
Nine consultants under contract with the state have reported holding stock i=
n=20
power companies, including Calpine and Enron, that have reaped huge profits=20
during California's energy crunch.=20
Political foes of the governor, most notably Secretary of State Bill Jones,=20
have raised questions in recent weeks about potential conflicts involving th=
e=20
consultants, who helped buy power and negotiate long-term contracts that=20
critics say will saddle consumers with artificially high electricity costs=20
for years to come.=20
The administration's tough stance Thursday with the consultants punctuates a=
=20
startling change of tactics.=20
For months, Davis' aides had not required the consultants to file financial=20
disclosure forms to report their personal stock holdings. By law, the=20
disclosure documents must be filed within 30 days of going on the state=20
payroll. The reports were filed after Jones began putting pressure on the=20
governor last week.=20
Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, dispatched a letter=20
early Wednesday demanding that the consultants sell the stock by noon that=20
day or face termination of their state contracts.=20
"It is imperative that you give this instruction, immediately, to each of th=
e=20
consultants," Goode said in his letter to the state Department of Water=20
Resources, which has taken over from California's beleaguered private=20
utilities the job of buying power.=20
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the=20
highest ethical standards," Goode wrote. "That standard is not met by those=20
who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading=20
on behalf of the state on energy related matters."=20
Goode's admonishment was conveyed by Tom Hannigan, water resources director,=
=20
to 34 consultants who are on contract with the department, among them the=20
nine contract employees who reported holding shares in generating firms.=20
Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said all the consultants holding=20
stock had agreed to sell it by the noon deadline.=20
But the stock sales did not satisfy Jones, who plans to challenge Davis in=20
next year's election.=20
He characterized the administration's action Wednesday as "way too little an=
d=20
too late."=20
Although the energy crisis and the hiring of numerous consultants on short=20
notice represents an unusual situation, the governor's staff should have bee=
n=20
aware of the conflict-of-interest issue, said Bob Stern, president of the=20
Center for Government Studies in Los Angeles and an author of the state's=20
Political Reform Act.=20
"Somebody," he said, "was asleep at the switch in the governor's office."=20
"We are talking here about major amounts of money," Stern said. "You don't=20
get involved with decisions that affect your financial interest."=20
Of the consultants who filed disclosure reports last week, six reported that=
=20
they own stock in Calpine Corp. One reported holding stock in Enron Corp. On=
e=20
of those seven resigned her state consultant's job a few days ago.=20
The latest conflict-of-interest statements, filed earlier this week, reveal=20
that three other consultants own energy company stock.=20
Mark Skowronski, who works for the Electric Power group, owned $10,000 to=20
$100,000 in stock in power producer Reliant Energy Inc. when he went to work=
=20
for the state.=20
In a note attached to his disclosure form, Skowronski said he sold his share=
s=20
in Reliant on March 20 after he was given the assignment as the lead state=20
negotiator with the company. He continues to own four blocks of Edison stock=

=20
"I have had no dealings with Edison and have not had a conflict of interest,=

Accounting Office Demands Energy Task Force Records
By JEFF GERTH

The New York Times=20
Page 20, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

WASHINGTON, July 18 -- After two months of unsuccessful requests, the Genera=
l=20
Accounting Office demanded today that Vice President Dick Cheney turn over=20
records relating to how his energy task force developed its policies.=20
The demand letter, by the Congressional auditing office acting at the reques=
t=20
of two ranking Democratic House members, increases the possibility of a lega=
l=20
and constitutional clash between Congress and the Bush administration.
A White House spokeswoman, Anne Womack, said the letter was ''under review,=20
and we're going to continue to work with the G.A.O. to try and resolve this=20
issue appropriately.''=20
Last month Mr. Cheney's counsel told the office that it lacked jurisdiction=20
over the task force because the panel acted only as an adviser to the=20
president, a function protected by the Constitution.=20
The White House has 20 days to respond to the letter. The accounting office=20
could then go to federal court to try to enforce the demand letter, one of 3=
2=20
issued by the G.A.O. since 1980 to various federal departments. This is the=20
first time a demand letter has been sent to a vice president, accounting=20
office officials said.=20
The letter seeks information about people with whom Mr. Cheney and other tas=
k=20
force members met while developing the group's policies, but not information=
=20
about ''the deliberative process.'' Mr. Cheney has said that the task force'=
s=20
report in May, which contained more than 100 recommendations involving energ=
y=20
production, infrastructure, conservation and the environment, was based on=20
sound public policy considerations.=20
In an interview tonight on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' broadcast on=20
PBS, Mr. Cheney said the task force realized at the outset that it had to=20
have an ''adequate concern for the environment in this report, or we're not=20
going to have a credible report.''=20
But some Democrats and other critics say energy industry executives and thei=
r=20
lobbyists had too much influence over Mr. Cheney's plan, while environmental=
=20
and consumer groups were ignored or treated perfunctorily. And the vice=20
president's refusal to release the names of people who contacted the task=20
force led two of his chief critics, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of=20
California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, both Democrats, to bring in the=20
accounting office for a closer look.=20
Mr. Cheney has acknowledged meeting with energy executives, including Kennet=
h=20
L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, but denies that they exercise=
d=20
any undue influence on the deliberations.=20
''The idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply isn'=
t=20
true,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview last spring. ''We'll make decisions=20
on what we think makes sound public policy.''=20
Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Cheney's spokeswoman, declined to discuss any=20
specific meetings involving the task force or the vice president.=20
''We don't release the vice president's schedule,'' Ms. Weiss said.=20
More broadly, however, she said Mr. Cheney's task force -- the National=20
Energy Policy Development Group, composed of cabinet officers and other=20
government officials -- met with many elected officials, organizations and=20
outside interests. The group's report was released on May 17, and many of it=
s=20
recommendations require further action by Congress and government agencies.=20
Mr. Cheney's counselor, Mary Matalin, said Democrats should now look to the=20
aftermath of the report instead of the group's deliberations.=20
''If they want to know what happened in the meetings, look at what it spawne=
d=20
in legislation that is on the Hill,'' Ms. Matalin said.=20
And since the report's release, Mr. Cheney has met with some=20
environmentalists, his spokeswoman said.=20
Some environmental groups said today that this was too little and too late.=20
''Industry has had direct access to key decision makers while representative=
s=20
of the public interest and environmental communities are left to the=20
sidelines,'' said Alyssondra Campaigne, the legislative director for the=20
Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been unsuccessful in seeking=20

California Power Consultants Must Sell Stocks, L.A. Times Says
2001-07-19 08:20 (New York)

     Washington, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis's administration ordered consultants handling the management
of California's energy crisis to sell their stock in power
companies, the Los Angeles Times reported.
     Political foes of the governor, including Secretary of State
Bill Jones, raised questions about potential conflicts of interest
involving the consultants, who helped the state negotiate long-
term contracts with power companies, the paper said.
     A letter early yesterday was sent by the governor's legal
affairs secretary, Barry Goode, demanding that the 34 consultants
under contract with the state sell their stock by noon yesterday
or face termination of their contracts, the paper said.
     Nine consultants under contract with the state have reported
owning stock in power companies such as Enron Corp. and Calpine
Corp., which have made large profits during the state's energy
crisis, the paper said.
