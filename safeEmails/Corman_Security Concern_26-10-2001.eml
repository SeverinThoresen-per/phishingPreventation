With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to r=
eport two items:

1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow sec=
tion (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the cover=
ed area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in =
this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's prob=
ably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I =
pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804. =
 The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't =
corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't s=
eem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website=
 posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps o=
ther employees will as well....
