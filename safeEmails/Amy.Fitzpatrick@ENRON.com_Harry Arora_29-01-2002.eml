Kevin -

Just want to double check that Harry has declined the contract and offer let=
ter from UBS. =20

I have a letter that David handed over which states he was declining the con=
tract, but wanted to remain an employee at will.

Sorry for double checking, but just wanted to close the loop.

Thanks!
Amy
