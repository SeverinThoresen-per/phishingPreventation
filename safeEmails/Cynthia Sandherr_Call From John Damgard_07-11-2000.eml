Linda: John called me several days ago and asked if I would set up a meeting=
=20
with you, John and me when convenient to discuss his interest in setting up =
a=20
new trade group to promote derivatives issues. He said that "Enron has shown=
=20
some interest" but I did not ask him to identify who from Enron had shown=20
interest. He also expressed a view that the CFTC was acting too much like a=20
legislator and he preferred to have Treasury handle these matters.  Let me=20
know how you want to proceed and the meeting can be scheduled. Joe
