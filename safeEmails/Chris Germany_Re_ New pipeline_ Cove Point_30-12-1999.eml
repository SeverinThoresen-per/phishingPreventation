I need a new pipeline set up.  CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on=20
this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.  All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.

Name:   Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership
Internet Address: http://www.latec.com/covepointlng/
Curve:   Tetco M3


This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on=
