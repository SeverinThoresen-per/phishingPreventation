I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just =
S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in tim=
e on Sat. Nov 3. =20

Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing =
about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour =
drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.

Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very=
 early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car=
 for a day of sightseeing.
