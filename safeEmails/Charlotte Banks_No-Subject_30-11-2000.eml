Friends who Pray together, stay together. Let's pray...

Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I Thank You for my being able to see
and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing
me.

Forgive me this day for I have sinned. I ask now for Your forgiveness.
Keep me safe from all danger and harm. Let me start this day with a new
attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every
day and give my best in all that is put before me.

Clear my mind that I can hear from You. Broaden my mind that I can accept
all things. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.

Let me continue to see sin through Your eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and
receive the forgiveness of God and sin no more.

And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example - to
slipaway and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm
pushed
beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart.
Continue to use me to do Thy Will. Continue to bless me that I may be a
blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak and unsaved.

Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. pray
for those who are lost and can't find their way. I pray for those who are
misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who refuse to share a word
from You. I pray for those who don't know You intimately.
I pray for those who will only read this and not speak this aloud in their
own lives. I pray for those who will delete this without sharing it with
others. I pray for those who don't believe. But, I thank you that I believe.

I believe that God changes people and God changes things.
I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member
in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes, that
they are out of debt and all their needs are met. There are no
circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in His hands
for Him to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of
every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.

This is my prayer. In Jesus Name, Amen.
