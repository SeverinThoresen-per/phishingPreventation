I received a call from Shannon last Wednesday (1/12), requesting what our=20
needs might be for new analysts who will be starting in 2/00.  Shannon and I=
=20
have talked specifics, but if you have an interest, please call Shannon ASAP=
=20
@ x33853 to discuss the specifics.

It has been some time since we have put a new analyst into Logistics - Texas=
,=20
but the other groups have taken new ones in the past.  I'm just asking you t=
o=20
think about it, and let me and Shannon know.  Thanks.


Shannon:  I do have an analyst rotating 6/1 from the Texas Risk team.  I=20
might be interested in putting another one into the group, and it's not a ba=
d=20
idea to start now with training.  Can you let me know who you still need to=20
place???  I would like to look at their resumes and talk with someone who=20
interviewed them.  Thanks.
