Jacques,

If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all=
 the agreements.  Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.
I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Pa=
yment".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreeme=
nt or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.

It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out or=
iginals here. =20

Thank you,

Phillip=20
