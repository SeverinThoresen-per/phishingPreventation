Can you give me confirmations on storage WD on 24, 26 & 28? I can only assum=
e=20
my request is confirmed unless told.
In Jan'01, you put ANR gas we bought under 3rd party, but in Dec it seems to=
=20
be only under citygate deals. Is that correct? I know I neglected to adjust=20
my FOM volume when those 3rd party vols change. Lets talk about 3rd party=20
when you get back Tues afternoon?
