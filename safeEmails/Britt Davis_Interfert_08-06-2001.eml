 Our next step is to file a pleading with the Versailles Court of Appeals,=20
which puts our spin on the Court-appointed expert's report. =20

 The deadline for filing our pleading is next Friday, although we need to=20
file it as early next week as possible, given that this is our third=20
extension of time.

 I have reviewed Bernard Mettatal's draft, had him make changes, and think w=
e=20
hit the right points.

 In short, Interfert knew the Court was going to limit its recovery to=20
commissions on deals it actively participated in with EGLE, Interfert had it=
s=20
shot at producing  information to support this position to the=20
Court-appointed expert, but Interfert failed to do so. =20
=20
 Our brief prays for recovery for all of the preliminary award made to=20
Interfert of 810,000 FF, and our attorneys' fees.

 A key issue is what the Court meant when it required that Interfert be=20
actively involved in the deal.  The trial judge wasn't very specific.  We sa=
y=20
it means Interfert had  to bring a real deal to us, not just introduce us to=
=20
a purchaser at lunch. =20

 Importantly, I just learned that a new judge will hear this case.  We don't=
=20
know who it will be yet; the judges in France move around quite a bit.  I've=
=20
got my fingers  crossed that Enron will get a better shake this time around.

 Given that this matter will not be set for hearing until March 2002, we may=
=20
get a ruling on our appeal from the French Supreme Court before then.

 Let me know what else you need from me so I can authorize Mettatal to file=20
our pleading.

 Thanks.

 Britt
