Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:

1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated=20
Subsidiary can be deleted.

2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added=
=20
at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it=20
relates to the Assigned Interest)"?  In other words, if these events as to=20
Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination=20
event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap=20
Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?

3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross=20
default language that Enron is now using.

4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".

Nora:
Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Sectio=
n=20
5.6.
