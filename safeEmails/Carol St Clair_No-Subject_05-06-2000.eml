Steve:
I spoke with Rod Nelson, our credit person, about the cross default language=
=20
and we have the following proposal to make.  We are okay with the language a=
s=20
it applies to declaring a an Event of Default and then declaring an early=20
Termination Date.  For purposes of triggering a reduction of the collateral=20
threshold to zero, we would propose that this language would not apply such=20
that an event of Default would be triggered upon the occurrence of the cross=
=20
default.  Let me know what you think.
Carol=20
