I had a conversation yesterday with Paul Burgener, Corp Risk Mgr, at DTE in =
Detroit. He told me that cash transactions with Enron are "business as usual=
" but that all term trades now receive increased scrutiny and               =
                                     are to be avoided, particularly if a re=
asonable substitute exists.Though he did not go so far as to say we were cut=
 off, it's clear to Paul's group that term trades with Enron are not career =
enhancers.
