Dave,

Everyone of these countries is important to physical and financial trading. =
=20
Ranking the countries=20

Chile - number one copper producing country in the world
China - very big consumer/trader/producer in copper, ally, zinc etc
Peru - very large producer of copper, lead, zinc precious
Brazil - large producer/consumer

To me it is an issue of time for all of these countries.

Subject: Metals due diligence

Dear Jonathan,

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries=20
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading=
=20
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are=20
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals=20
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives -=
=20
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for=20
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals. =20
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions.=20

Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany=
,=20
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia,=20
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently=
=20
EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review. =20
Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want=20
to run with it?

Australia
Canada
Japan
United States

There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL=20
access documentation. =20
Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access=20
documentation for these countries?

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Mexico
Korea
Republic of China

Regards,=20

Edmund
