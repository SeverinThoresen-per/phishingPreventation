Please let me know if you are interested in learning how to run the=20
transportation model to assist you in pricing long term transport deals.  Th=
e=20
model is not difficult to run once you understand what inputs are necessary.=
 =20
Also remember once you've learned to use this model that it is not "cut and=20
dry"--it is just one of the tools that we have for pricing forward=20
transportation. =20

For anyone that would like to learn, I will be more than happy to come by=20
your desk or, if you do not currently have access to the model, you can come=
=20
by my desk for a demo.  I believe the instruction will work better either on=
e=20
on one or in very small groups.

Also, if I have missed someone that you believe would benefit from the=20
transportation model instruction, please advise.
