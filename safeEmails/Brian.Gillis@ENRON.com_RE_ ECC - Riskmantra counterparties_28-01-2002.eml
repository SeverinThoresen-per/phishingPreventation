Dawn,

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to opera=
te this way. =20

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the U=
S counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on =
any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviousl=
y considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it=
 for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Brian

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the t=
ransactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...a=
re we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review=
 the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know i=
f there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn
