As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you=
 have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilli=
ng, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class=
 actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the pro=
cess of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you=
 wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarant=
ee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.=

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to=
 discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesita=
te to call me with any questions.

Thank you.     =20
