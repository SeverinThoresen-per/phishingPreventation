I received a phone call yesterday from Jerry Shrader at CMS regarding the=20
Powder River Gas Gathering Project.  He informed me that the members of Fort=
=20
Union would like to undertake an expansion of the facility.  While the=20
members are unanimous in their desire to undertake this expansion, there is =
a=20
concern among some of them whether (i) the consent of the lenders and the=20
administrative agent is required, and (ii) the expansion might cause a=20
default under the financing documents.  In light of these concerns, Jerry=20
contacted me and asked that we review the relevant documents.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 220-4427 if you have any questions or i=
f=20
I can be of further assistance.

Sean
