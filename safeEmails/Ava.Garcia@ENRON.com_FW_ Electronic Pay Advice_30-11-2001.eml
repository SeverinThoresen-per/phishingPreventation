I've checked the ISC about the inability to view pay information via eHRonli=
ne this morning.  They are having a problem with the electronic pay advice f=
unction.  The recorded message says that there will be resolution to the pro=
blem by noon.  It did not mention anything about those receiving a paper cop=
y of their pay advice so I'm assuming (not always a good idea) that those wi=
ll come in the morning mail run.  I'll check later and try to get an update =
for you.
