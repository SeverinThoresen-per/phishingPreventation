Dan,

I agree as to your decision to complete the reimbursment for cell phones for=
 year 2001.

However, I will NOT use the Four Star card for gasoline purchases any longer=
, since Mr. D was opposed to this practice.

Hey -- have a HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

Love you.

I hear you Susan, but that is nickels and dimes.  In the scheme of things it=
 is small. I think we should at least reiburse ourselves for phones etc thro=
ugh 12/31/01.  Otherwise, we lose two ways: (1) we don't get the money back =
and (2) the amounts are not deductible by anyone. We need to keep our eyes o=
n taxes deuctions too. So that is my view.

Dan,

I have reviewed your (as always through) summary of events, as well as
having reviewed the cash flow ledgers.  With respect to the saving of
funds -- I would suggest that you & I no longer charge our gasoline
usage to Four Star, nor reimburse ourselves for our cell phone usage.

As you know, Mr. Donato did not approve of the gasoline charges w/ the
Four Star credit card, especially in light of the fact that Four Star
does not own either of our cars/vehicles.

Let me know about the gasoline and cell phone thoughts.

Love you. =20
