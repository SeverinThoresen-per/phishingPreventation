FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.

John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer.=20

Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that th=
e
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia=20
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete=
=20
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters=
=20
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the poo=
l
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also=
=20
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Carol

Carol,
Once our production pool is set up, I would like to transfer the CES/ENA=20
meters
into our pool.  What do you need from me to transfer these meters?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this loc=
al
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can=20
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to gi=
ve
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identificatio=
n
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the loca=
l
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will nee=
d
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,
Heidi Boyd
