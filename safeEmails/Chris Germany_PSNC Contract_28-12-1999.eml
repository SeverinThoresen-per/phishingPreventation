Did you guys execute the PSNC contract?? And if so - as CES or CEM??  Also,=20
I'd like to have the offer number.

I think Transco is done except for PSNC.

Transco Stuff
I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES
I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES.
I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.
