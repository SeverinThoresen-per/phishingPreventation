WASHINGTON -- Starting today, federal power regulators will begin trying to=20
solve one of the riddles of the energy crisis: How much of a refund will=20
California get?=20
One thing seems clear: The reduction will be a lot more than the $125-millio=
n=20
refund ordered to date, in all likelihood soaring to more than $1 billion.
Over the next 15 days--the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is mandating=
=20
no weekends off--warring representatives from power companies and the state=20
of California will sit at the same table in a government conference room=20
while a FERC task force wrestles the question to the ground.=20
The task is to determine the price that power would have cost if FERC's=20
decision to impose soft caps had been made not last week, but last fall.=20
It is a daunting mathematical problem, factoring in hourly charges during th=
e=20
last eight months. To come up with a total, federal regulators, state=20
electricity officials and power generators must determine what the highest=20
price for a megawatt should have been under the soft price caps now in=20
effect. Then they have to figure out which companies--if any--were charging=20
more.=20
Under the recent FERC ruling, the price of electricity during any given hour=
=20
cannot exceed the actual cost of generating the least efficient--or most=20
expensive--power coming into the grid.=20
Curtis L. Wagner, the 72-year-old chief judge for FERC who is overseeing=20
negotiations on California's overcharges, said of this morning's events: "It=
=20
will be a zoo."=20
Wagner, who headed into the weekend with three inches of documents to sort=20
through, explained that Gov. Gray Davis wants $9 billion knocked off the=20
amount the power generators charged California. "I don't really think it's=20
that high," said Wagner, predicting the refund will be more than $1 billion=20
but probably far from $9 billion.=20
"We have folks trying to do some adding now and some work on what the number=
=20
should be," he said.=20
Wagner said the money at stake will be the most he has worked on in his=20
nearly three-decade career at the agency.=20
Until recently, the likelihood of massive refunds seemed nil. Although=20
California lawmakers--led by Davis--had demanded relief for costs that ran a=
s=20
high as 10 times or more than the rates a year ago, FERC officials had not=20
agreed.=20
And their minds seemed set. When FERC first proposed remedies for the=20
California price increases late last year, commissioners said: "Refunds may=20
be an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental=20
solution to any problems occurring in California markets."=20
To date, FERC has ordered $125 million in refunds for alleged overcharges in=
=20
January and February.=20
But with the recent appointment of two new commissioners by President=20
Bush--Republicans Patrick H. Wood III of Texas and Nora M. Brownell of=20
Pennsylvania--FERC's position softened, leading to the price mitigation=20
ordered last week.=20
Now FERC is taking a closer look at the prices already charged.=20
California lawmakers have pegged overcharges at nearly $9 billion since the=20
California market went haywire last summer--a number that comes from a study=
=20
done by Cal-ISO, the operator of California's electricity grid. Cal-ISO=20
officials acknowledged last week that the study might have significant flaws=
=2E=20
Among companies that may be required to reduce their bills are energy giants=
=20
Enron Corp., Mirant Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos. and Reliant=20
Energy Inc.--all of which are expected to have representatives at the=20
negotiations. The companies have hotly disputed the amount of overcharges=20
alleged by Davis and other California lawmakers and point out that they have=
=20
yet to be paid for the vast majority of electricity sold in the state in=20
recent months.=20
Today, Wagner said he plans to make opening statements to the media. After=20
that, he said he hasn't determined how much of the wangling will be done=20
behind closed doors. If the parties don't come to an agreement in 15 days,=20
Wagner will have seven days to make a recommendation on refunds to FERC's=20
five commissioners.=20
It is a process that may be repeated down the road if Sen. Barbara Boxer=20
(D-Calif.) and other California politicians get their way. Boxer has=20
introduced legislation that would give FERC retroactive power to order=20

A critical showdown in California's energy crisis starts this morning, as=20
state officials meet with energy companies to demand $9 billion in refunds.=20
A 15-day settlement conference, ordered as part of the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission's decision last week to put price controls on wholesal=
e=20
electricity prices, will bring together the parties that have been squabblin=
g=20
for the past year.
"We are going to Washington with one goal, and that is to bring back $9=20
billion," Gov. Gray Davis told reporters yesterday. "The fact is that people=
=20
have taken advantage of the market, gamed the system and ripped people off."=
=20
But Davis' crusade may be dampened by challenges to the study the state used=
=20
to arrive at the $9 billion figure and by a FERC mediator's prediction that=20
California will walk away with less than it is demanding.=20
The Democratic governor's figure is based on an update of a March study by=20
the California Independent System Operator, which manages the sate's power=20
grid. Some energy experts argue the study is flawed, but the ISO stood firm=20
behind its methodology yesterday.=20
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the FERC administrative law judge who will oversee the=
=20
meeting, said in an interview with The Chronicle yesterday that he was=20
optimistic a settlement would be reached.=20
Wagner said the $9 billion "seems a little high. And the generators' numbers=
=20
seem low. We'll probably come out somewhere in between."=20
The veteran mediator, who spent yesterday reviewing spreadsheets submitted b=
y=20
the parties, said he will look at applying last week's commission price=20
control order back to October.=20
"I think we should put the refund issue to rest," Wagner said. "I'm sure we=20
can agree on a structure that is fair to everybody." Enron Corp, Reliant=20
Energy Inc., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp.=20
are among the companies facing allegations of illegally overcharging=20
California. The companies say the high prices were a result of the high cost=
s=20
of natural gas used to generate power.=20
"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," said=20
Mark Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, whic=
h=20
represent the generators.=20
But Davis insisted that the state will recover the full amount it is asking.=
=20
"Under the law, FERC has no discretion," he said. "It is mandated to refund=20
excessive charges, if prices were found to be unjust and unreasonable, which=
=20
they were."=20
The governor, however, acknowledged that some of the money he is demanding=20
may be owed by municipal utilities that do not fall under FERC's=20
jurisdiction.=20
Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said municipal utilities such as Los Angeles=20
Department of Water and Power and BC Hydro that sold electricity to the stat=
e=20
have been invited to join the talks as well.=20
"We need the FERC to lay the basis to seek refunds from private generators,=20
and use that as a basis to seek refunds from public generators," she said.=20
California could face an obstacle in its case for the full repayment it=20
seeks. Under FERC rules, overcharges can only be authorized after a formal=20
investigation is ordered, which in this case started on Oct. 2, 2000. If=20
Wagner sticks to that time frame, it eliminates the summer 2000 months when=20
prices first began to spike.=20
"There is no question we can order refund from that (October) date forward,"=
=20
Wagner said. "Legally, there may be some question before that date."=20
But Wagner said a FERC regulations may not necessarily rule out broader=20
refunds. "That's the great thing about a settlement -- you can do anything,"=
=20
he said.=20
If no settlement is reached in 15 days, Wagner will forward his=20
recommendations to the full commission for its approval. California will the=

have the option of pursuing the matter further in court.=20
California's delegation will be led by Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer=20

Californians Get Rude to Enron Executives.

Californians are being downright rude to Enron executives these days.=20
First, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer suggested that Enron Chairma=

Kenneth Lay ought to be forced to spend some time in a prison cell with a=20
tattooed character named Spike who was looking for "companionship."
Thursday, an angry electricity consumer threw a cream pie in the face of=20
President and Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling as he was preparing to addres=
s=20
a civic and business group in San Francisco.=20
According to wire service reports, the pie thrower was a woman from the=20
Biotic Baking Brigade, an organization that makes a practice of "creaming"=20
controversial figures. Past recipients include Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates=
=20
and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.=20
Skilling went ahead with his speech to the Commonwealth Club of California,=20
telling them that Gov. Gray Davis was not responsible for the current crisis=
=20
because he had inherited the regulatory morass from the prior administration=
=2E=20
Davis was elected in 2000, succeeding Republican Pete Wilson.=20
Skilling, an ardent Republican, couldn't let the Democratic governor escape=20
without some criticism. He said that Davis had exacerbated the problem by no=
t=20
addressing it promptly when the first signs appeared last year.=20
Enron Vice President Karen Denne said that company executives anticipated=20
some sort of demonstration by disgruntled electricity consumers. "Obviously,=
=20
this is a very emotional issue," she said. "There was risk in our coming to=20
the state, but we feel strongly enough about the issue that we felt it was=20
important to talk about the situation and what could be done to fix the=20
problem."=20
Denne maintains that listeners received Skilling's remarks favorably. "They=20
did seem to be receptive to the message," she said.=20
Wall Street also has been rather impolite to Enron of late. The company's=20

MARKET WEEK
Commodities Corner
Power Plays: Beaten-down energy stocks look attractive
By Cheryl Strauss Einhorn

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week voted to extend controls=20
on California power prices to 10 other Western states and to keep them in=20
force every day, rather than just during shortages. The news sent share=20
prices tumbling, not only for energy trading and marketing companies, such a=
s=20
Enron, but also for alternative energy providers, such as Plug Power, and=20
outfits that build and operate power plants, such as Calpine and NS Group.=20
The decision dampened expectations for the profitability of these industries=
,=20
in part because capped prices will reduce incentives to build power plants=20
and to find new energy sources.=20
While regulators' decision to "mitigate" prices is popular with consumers, i=
t=20
does nothing to fix the underlying energy problem. For the companies being=20
vilified are exactly those that need the most investment to expand energy=20
supplies. Their shares' selloff may make them ripe for picking. With their=20
services a necessity, these companies should find politicians willing to com=
e=20
up with tax breaks and other incentives to offset the price caps and boost=20
the supply of electricity.
Donato Eassey, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows electric, natural-gas and=
=20
other energy companies, thinks the stocks are "now well oversold." For "whil=
e=20
there still remains a long road ahead to navigate through the California=20
chaos, we believe the crushing political pressures, which have helped=20
decimate over $45 billion in energy merchant market cap since the beginning=20
of the year [for an average decline of 27%], may be in an ebbing mode."=20
Which companies look best? Perhaps Sempra Energy, which signed a preliminary=
=20
agreement last week with the State of California to settle its $750 million=20
in undercollected power costs. The settlement should not have any earnings=20
impact, in part because the company is well reserved. This company is one of=
=20
the very few energy trading and marketing shops that hasn't suffered a big=20
stock setback in the past month. Eassey describes it as "holding in there=20
like a rock." Sempra's share price is unchanged during the past month and is=
=20
actually up 18% this year.=20
Eassey says the stock has held up well, in part because it has been=20
undervalued as investors have failed to recognize that the company does much=
=20
more than generate energy: "It has a sizable trading and marketing arm." Now=
,=20
though, he thinks it will benefit from being the largest combination U.S. ga=
s=20
and electric utility; its assets, he says, mean the company "has a lot of=20
shock-absorbing capacity."=20
In addition, the surge in electric and gas prices is expected to move states=
=20
and companies toward long-term, fixed-price energy contracts, which provide=20
better margins to the energy companies than selling at volatile spot-market=20
prices.=20
As a result, Sempra, which trades at 11 times expected earnings and five=20
times expected cash flow, while posting a return on equity of 20.5%, could=20
"conservatively see 43% total-return potential" in the next 12 months, Easse=
y=20
says, for a price target of 36.35.=20
He likes the prospects for shares of Dynegy, El Paso Energy and Williams,=20
which have been crushed in the past month. Indeed, after being the=20
second-best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, Dynegy is off 26% in=20
the past month alone, while shares of El Paso are down 19% and those of=20
Williams are off 16%.=20
All these companies' businesses are diversified; they're not only in=20
exploration and production, but also in pipeline and refining, as well as in=
=20
coal and natural-gas liquids. Each owns some generating capacity and trades=20
and markets energy products. Eassey sees the companies also benefiting from=20
their business mix and from the greater certainty that long-term, fixed-pric=
e=20
contracts offer. He looks for 30%-40% price appreciation for the group in th=
e=20
next 12-24 months.=20
Yet for Enron, often considered the premier trader and marketer, Eassey is=20
less optimistic, even though its shares have taken a hefty 17% hit in the=20
past month. Enron doesn't own much generation capacity. Moreover, although=20
energy prices may continue to be volatile, there is a perception that price=20
peaks and troughs may grow less pronounced because the market is more heavil=
y=20
regulated and there are fewer spot -- or cash market -- transactions. Thus,=20
profits from Enron's trading may shrink. The company is in a "show-me" state=
,=20
he says.=20
After posting its biggest daily fall in 2 1/2 years Wednesday, gasoline=20
slumped to a six-month low at week's end, after the nation's biggest pipelin=
e=20
stopped accepting new shipments from the Gulf Coast to the East. This is a=20
signal that the market is well- supplied for the peak summer-driving months.=
=20
July futures fell to 77.50 cents a gallon, or nearly 12% on the week.=20

SURVEY - POLAND - Why overseas energy investors are failing to generate high=

SURVEY - POLAND - Why overseas energy investors are failing to generate high=
=20
returns - POWER by John Reed - With liberalisation yet to find the correct=20
model and energy consumption half the EU average, most foreign companies hav=
e=20
to be there for the long-term.=20
As California's power crisis demonstrates, there is no handy single template=
=20
for privatising the energy sector. Small wonder, then, that Poland's effort=20
to liberalise its energy market and find new owners for its power plants and=
=20
distributors has a mild air of improvisation about it.
When the government approved an "integrated timetable" to privatise the=20
sector a year ago, its experts looked at reforms in Norway, Britain,=20
Australia and - sure enough - California, says Wojciech Tabis of the energy=20
department.=20
Last April, less than a year into the programme, the government amended the=20
strategy.=20
The shift reflected in part changes on the ground - including the creation o=
f=20
Poludniowy Koncern Energetyczny, a powerful group of seven generators in=20
southwestern Poland - and partly the view, promoted by economy minister=20
Janusz Steinhoff, that Poland should sell its investment-starved power plant=
s=20
first.=20
This was on the grounds that distribution companies are natural monopolies=20
and certain to attract investors.=20
Now Poland plans to accelerate the sale of power plants, while continuing to=
=20
privatise two distribution companies already underway: Warsaw's Stoen, and=20
the so-called G-8 group of northern power distributors.=20
"In most EU countries, the power sector is either partly or wholly=20
state-controlled," explains Professor Marian Milek, deputy treasury ministry=
=20
responsible for energy.=20
"Poland is opening up, so we need to be careful that there will be a=20
guarantee of the security of our power market."=20
For foreign investors, Poland holds the lure of a deregulating market where=20
power consumption per head is only about half the EU average. With EU=20
membership in sight this decade, Poland could also serve as a conduit for th=
e=20
transit of cheap power from ex-Soviet countries to the West.=20
French utilities Electricite de France and SNET, Poland's Elektrim and=20
Sweden's Vattenfall have invested to date.=20
The Swedish state-owned utility owns 32 per cent of the southern GZE=20
distribution group and 55 per cent. Warsaw's district heating plant in=20
Siekierki, and hopes to increase both stakes to a majority within two years.=
=20
Vattenfall is targeting Poland, alongside Germany, as prime territory to=20
expand. "In the European market, it's a question of eat or be eaten," says=20
Hannu Kostiainen, general manager for Poland.=20
"We have to grow and increase the value of the company, and the only way to=20
do this is to invest."=20
Poland's power market is expected to get an added fillip on July 1 when, if=20
the country's energy regulator keeps its earlier promises, the country will=20
begin moving away from tariff controls while Polskie Sieci=20
Elektroenergetyczne, the power-grid company, initiates the operation of an=20
hourly balancing market.=20
Both measures will contribute to the creation of a fully-fledged wholesale=20
market for power, a prospect attractive to both foreign and local market=20
players.=20
One is US power giant Enron, which invested in a gas-fired plant a year ago=20
with the explicit aim of gaining a foothold for future business in power=20
trade.=20
Some of the early investors have complained of a difficult time from=20
regulators, officials, and the strains of working on a still-unliberalised=20
market.=20
One publicly-held foreign energy company that failed in a bid for a power=20
plant last year complains the going is so hard that only state-controlled=20
companies like Vattenfall and EdF can afford to tough it out.=20
"They're determined to get into Poland regardless of the short-term costs,"=20
he says, declining to be quoted because of pending business at other energy=20
companies. "Unfortunately, we have to satisfy shareholders."=20
Vattenfall's Mr Kostiainen disputes the view. "Financing our operations is=20
much more difficult than for private companies," he says. "We can't use new=20
emissions to do it, so we're dependent on bank financing and our own cash=20
flow."=20
Yet he and other company officials, while noting the market's promise, have=20
also complained of tough going in the initial phase.=20
Some of the issues are familiar to veterans of Polish state sell-offs in=20
other sectors, including the need to sign a "social pact" with the plant's=20
powerful unions.=20
At Vattenfall's Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie power plant in Siekierki, its=20
talks with unions yielded a five-year guarantee of employment for workers,=20
plus a "privatisation bonus" of 15,000 zlotys ( $3,750) per head. The compan=
y=20
was lucky to negotiate the unions down from their demand to match a=20
seven-year guarantee paid by a rival investor at another Polish plant, says=20
Jan Reutergardh of Vattenfall.=20
Zealous regulation of tariffs by the Bureau of Energy Regulation, Poland's=20
sectoral watchdog, has also squeezed the operation's bottom line.=20
Last year, says Mr Reutergardh, the body approved a3 per cent tariff for=20
Siekierki, though inflation was about 10 per cent. The plant reported a 16m=20
zloty profit last year, but the gains were eaten up by "social funds"=20
reserves made, and other costs relating to the privatisation process, he say=
s=20
"Poland has to go into the EU, and has to privatise companies," Mr Kostiaine=
n=20
says pointedly. "But if they want foreign companies to participate, they hav=
e=20
to make sure the investors are satisfied."=20
The tariff liberalisation promised starting in July should silence some of=20
the investors' complaints.=20
So will a planned move away from long-term offtake contracts. The contracts=20
account for about two-thirds of the existing market and, as a side-effect,=20
give generators little incentive to lower their prices.=20
They were bestowed on power plants to provide them with collateral for bank=20
loans to finance their development.=20
One reflection of the resulting distortion is the slow trading at Poland's=20
wholesale power exchange. It trades barely 1-2 per cent of the total market=20
turnover, below the 4-5 per cent deputy minister Mr Milek says it needs to=20
become viable.=20

BANGALORE, June 24. LARSEN and Toubro has sought a 51 per cent stake in the=20
500 MW Vijaynagar thermal power project. The project is being taken up as a=20
joint venture with Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd (KPCL).=20
KPCL sources said the shareholders' agreement would be finalised with L&T=20
once some of the issues such as restricted tenure of power purchasing=20
agreement (PPA) were addressed.
KPCL had originally shortlisted PowerGen International and Enron along with=20
L&T as the joint venture partners for the project. But both Enron and=20
PowerGen pulled out of the financial bids, leaving L&T as the lone bidder.=20
The original proposal had envisaged a 25 per cent stake for the joint ventur=
e=20
partner, with 26 per cent with KPCL and the remaining equity to be raised=20
through the participation of financial institutions, banks, equipment=20
suppliers and the public.=20
The sources said that among the issues that have been raised by L&T included=
=20
the State Government's restriction on PPAs. As per the new power policy=20
adopted by the State Government, the validity of the PPAs has been restricte=
d=20
only to five years.=20
This was not acceptable to either KPCL or L&T. Such a policy framework, the=20
sources said, would result in front-loading of tariffs, which in turn would=20
imply high tariffs. This was because the entire debt recovery period would=20
have to restricted to this period. Accordingly, what is now being sought is =
a=20
longer duration PPA, on the basis of internationally-recognised 30-year=20
contracts. This would allow the tariff to be kept to optimum levels, even=20
after factoring in a minimum of 16 per cent return on equity as is permitted=
=20
by the Electricity Supply Act.=20
Besides, the sources said, the Government's policies regarding tariff=20
indexing also needed to be clarified. The Government wants a flat rate of=20
tariff indexing of five per cent per annum, whereas generating companies=20
would ideally prefer to have a tariff indexed to actual prevailing costs of=20
operations or inflation-linked. It is only after these issues are sorted out=
=20
that KPCL is prepared to proceed with the finalising of the PPA.=20
Along with these issues, the project cost has also been quietly revised.=20
The new cost per MW has been worked out to Rs 4.62 crore per MW, which is in=
=20
line with the estimates made for two of the 1000 MW stations - CLP-Tata and=20
Nagarjuna Power - proposed in the State.=20
The original cost estimate was Rs 2,099 crore or Rs 4.1 per MW. Accordingly,=
=20
the revised project cost is now about Rs 2,400 crore. This is to be funded=20
through a 70:30 debt equity ratio, with the equity component comprising of a=
t=20
least Rs 692 crore.=20
But KPCL has already tied up fuel linkage with Talcher. The coal requirement=
=20
for the project is estimated to be in the region 2.8 million tonnes per annu=
m=20
assuming a plant load factor of 80 per cent and a calorific value of 3,000=20
kilo calories per kg. This coal is to be brought by sea to the newly=20
corporatised port of Ennore and evacuated by the Railways to Vijaynagar.=20

The company which has been associated with the Indian power sector for the=20

private developers to set up such power plants.
In an exclusive interview to ET, Mr Rod William managing director of Rolls=20

In its bid to get attract customers from the industry, the company is=20

``We have got very favourable response and consumers from a wide range of=20
industries from glass, textile cement have shown interest, William said. Wha=
t=20
is interesting is that Rolls Royce has also been interacting with financial=20

realistic.=20
The road show will be held in Surat, Vadodhara and Mumbai in the first phase=
=20
and taken to other southern states in the second phase.=20
The company has zeroed in on Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh Gujarat and=20
Maharashtra as their target destinations for the gas based captive power=20
projects.=20
Apart from offering to set up plants, the company will also offer other=20
services like energy service, or operation and maintenance of the plant, and=
=20
even take up distribution for specified regions.=20
The idea behind taking up distribution would be to feed the excess power int=
