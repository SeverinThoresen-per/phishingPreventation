Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the=20
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at=
=20
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept=20
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct=20
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these=20
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is=20
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days=
=20
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and=
=20
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to=20
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partner=
s=20
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus=20
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all=20
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products.=20

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these=20
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Carol
