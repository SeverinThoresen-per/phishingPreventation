Someone sent this to me, it seemed appropriate!

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


=20
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."
=20
His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"
=20
The old man replied, "It's fart football."
=20
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
=20
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7."
=20
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."
=20
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead
17 to 14."
=20
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poop=
s
the bed.
=20
The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"
=20
And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."
