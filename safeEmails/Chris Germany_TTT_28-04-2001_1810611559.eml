DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably=
 not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to c=
harge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after provi=
ding the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom =
is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.=20
