Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification=20
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial=20
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical=20
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our=20
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although=20
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose=20
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Carol
