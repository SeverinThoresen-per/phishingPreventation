Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the big=
gest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Beca=
use we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of =
financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing =
with fairly large PMA adjustments.=20

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these number=
s.
