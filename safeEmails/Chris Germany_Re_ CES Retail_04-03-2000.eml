Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term=
=20
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information,=20
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and=20
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%=20
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to=20
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided=20
to us by CES. =20

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he=20
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of=
=20
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway,=20
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in=20
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be=20
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I=20
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,=20
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to=20
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things=20
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please=20
advise.
