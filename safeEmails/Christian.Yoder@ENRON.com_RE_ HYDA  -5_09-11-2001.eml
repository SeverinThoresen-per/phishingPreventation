How swift death's hand can arrive to touch any and all.  By analogy,  I gues=
s we are all experiencing the sudden death of an illusion.  I would say the =
death of that poor faithful animal is more significant than the death of a v=
ain illusion.  And, the fact that you would be the kind of person who would =
respond as you obviously did, out of compassion and tenderness, is a more im=
portant fact than some fucking number some Street agency is assigning to our=
 misery in some wretched board room atop a commercial temple.   ----cgy

One for the HYDA  index for Nov 8:

At 8:15 last night, after a day of what surely was the lowest point in my En=
ron journey, I went home.  Upon arrival, an old black dog was hit by a car t=
hat sped away.  The dog died at 9:00 on my doorstop.  We helped our neighbor=
s bury him.  Lets hope the crows know something different for today's report=
=2E

Oh, Nov 8th was also my husband's birthday.  Obviously no party.

The pronounced slow down in trading and the release of the restatement of in=
come figures, amounting as the numbers did,  to another heavy "foot falling,=
"  are substantive factors that are not mitigated by the fact that the Stree=
t stayed its raised boot from punting us across the junk bond  line and that=
 the Dynagy merger talks apparently continue, while the Mordant news further=
 darkens the perception of the inner sanctum of the commercial temple. =20

 What does it mean that as our inexorable fall continues step by step,  the =
crows, those sable messengers that were flying up and down this very river a=
t this very site when Rome fell, are showing increasingly positive signs?  T=
oday, several couples danced with what could only be seen as playfulness on =
the upcurrents of warm air that abound in and around the buildings,  gamboli=
ng aviary dyads  in the bright sun above the scarlet leaves, their dance upo=
n the wind currents clearly celebratory, even to our reluctant, jaded eyes, =
sickened with foul corruption.    ----cgy    =20
