Vicki,

As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by=
 Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basic=
ally claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 milli=
on.

Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to man=
age it on behalf of EES. =20

I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) =
to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we ha=
ve been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The=
 suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover lette=
r to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me).=20

The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; i=
t actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook Cou=
nty.

The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of cit=
izenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, th=
e Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would w=
ant to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to fe=
deral court.

Let me know how you want me to proceed.

Michelle
