	Glen, I had a conversation with Pat Davidson (SoCal) yesterday.  Things hav=
e been going smoothly,
	because SoCal has not been calling any OFO days.  She felt like we would no=
t have an issue until
	spring and at that time, there is an expectation that SoCal could be callin=
g more OFOs.  We agreed
	to continue talking, but that does not resolve the issue completely.  Thank=
s. Lynn

Attached is the SoCalGas response of our mild protest to their advice  lette=
r 2837-A.  The relevant language is on page 5 of their letter and has  been =
highlighted for your convenience.  In part, they state that:  =20
=20
"These types of reductions are no different from today's  practice of allowi=
ng customers to reduce nominations in the fourth scheduling  cycle.  The fla=
w is not in SoCalGas  new procedures.  SoCalGas provides  customers with not=
ice of an upcoming OFO two hours prior to scheduling cycle  closing times.  =
Within those two  hours, customers can make changes to their nominations and=
 still meet the  scheduling timeline as defined by GISB standards.  Even if =
SoCalGas cuts nominations in  cycle four because customer reductions don't r=
educe deliveries enough to avoid  operational problems, changes in cycle 4 a=
re within GISB standards.  Transwestern is supposed to be complying  with th=
ose GISB standards and seems to state that it is unable to do  so."
=20
They go on to state a willingness to  work with us on the issue.  There is n=
o procedural option for us to respond  to their response.  At this point, ou=
r option is to meet with Energy  Division staff to discuss the issue further=
, should we feel the need to do  so. =20

Have a good weekend!
