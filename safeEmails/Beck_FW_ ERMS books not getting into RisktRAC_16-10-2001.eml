What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed =
by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM me=
eting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie=
 Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's=
 schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks=
=2E  --Sally=20

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and th=
e need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on =
a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positi=
ons to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make correct=
ions.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this =
is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain ho=
w long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limi=
ted to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures.=20

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the=
 scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discus=
s this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how=
 long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impac=
t on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I be=
lieve it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what =
you think.

Thanks,
Wanda
