The FERC meeting is still going on but it is my understanding the FERC has:

issued an order addressing governance of the CAISO (and reported in the pres=
s) was held.

 set the California refund case to hearings and has modified the competitive=
 benchmark formula recommended by Judge Wagner.  When we know what the chang=
es are, we will inform you.  The Commission said muni's are subject to refun=
ds just like investor-owned utilities.

opened a proceeding on to accept requests for and consider refunds in the re=
st of the West. (!)

More to come ...
