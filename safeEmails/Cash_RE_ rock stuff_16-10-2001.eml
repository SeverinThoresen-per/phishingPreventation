Kevin / Michelle:

As I get ready for this mediation, I thought that these various presentation=
s to ECT senior management (McConnell, Pres. of HPL, Rice and Hannon) would =
be helpful.  Special attention to the Hannon presentation which clearly show=
s that the real benefits of this new company were NOT primarily related to t=
he monetization of the equipment (which Bill Rome contends), but instead wer=
e related to new business earnings and substantial cost savings.  This also =
has proved itself out as we go forward.

for a little laugh, but walks through the original deal strategic concept (w=
hich has nothing to do with a financing)
 << File: Story.ppt >>=20
what you used to sell the deal to mcconnell

 << File: McConnell.ppt >> =20
and the versions given to rice and hannon respectively
 << File: Rice.ppt >>  << File: hannon.ppt >>=20
and the presentation given to hms employees re: new business opportunity
 << File: HMS Final Presentation.ppt >>=20

have saved other analysis, etc if you need it...
