Subject: Re: Sales Agency Arrangements =20

When we took over the metals business there were indeed several agents who=20
were more like employees in the way that they acted. There were also many ad=
=20
hoc or minor agents.  The level of documentation varies considerably.  We=20
have taken two actions on this, depending on the circumstances

1.  They have been integrated as employees and HR have either issued or are=20
in the process of issuing normal Enron employment contracts

2.  We are performing a complete review of all agency agreements that exist=20
(there are many of them, but only a few are the situation that you describe=20
below) from source documents or payments. This is the basis on which we are=20
revising and issuing full enron contracts or informing the agent that we wil=
l=20
no longer require their services.   Suitable standard contracts are currentl=
y=20
being reviewed by Houston legal dept. For key agents we are also offering=20
FCPA training as part of our overall remote office FCPA training program.

The people copied above are those in London who are directly involved in thi=
s=20
process

Rob - commercial lead (reporting to Joe Gold)
Tina - tax
Paul - legal
Melanie - HR

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Subject: Sales Agency Arrangements

Naomi-

Hello, I work in Market Risk, and am involved in the Doorstep process. =20
During review of some visits last year, it came to our attention that Metals=
=20
evidently has some type of "sales agent" arrangements, whereby they engage=20
various individuals to represent them internationally, but without any=20
agreements in writing.

I'd like to confirm the circumstances when these arrangements are used, how=20
many Metals offices use this, and whether this is in fact something outside=20
the Metals realm.    Would you please elaborate on this subject?

Shona Wilson said you were the one to talk to.

Thank you,
