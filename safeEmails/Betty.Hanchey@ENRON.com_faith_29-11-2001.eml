Mr. Lay,
Enron has been very good to our contract company.  We have very little expec=
tation of being paid but we love this company as much as you do.  We work in=
 your corporate records with a great group of people and I feel we are neede=
d there at this time.  We have so much faith in you and we know you will pul=
l Enron through this tumultuous time.  This is meant to be a note of encoura=
gement for a man we all admire very much.  You've done it before.  You can d=
o it again.   =20
