The February NCL Regular Meeting will be this coming
Monday, February 12, beginning at 7:30 p.m. at Cypress
Creek Community Center.  We will be collecting items
to donate to Northwest Assistance Ministries, which
has suffered a serious cutback in funding. They are
particularly in need of personal care items such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, hair care items, etc.
