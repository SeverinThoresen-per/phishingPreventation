We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead and=20
transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo the=
=20
marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex contract=
=20
as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron and sel=
l=20
the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be no need=20
for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash=20
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one=20
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are=20
checking on them now.)
