When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, o=
ne of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I gue=
ss that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, ou=
r documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the =
end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas ti=
me travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a li=
ttle better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitm=
ents of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has bee=
n turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  S=
ince I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier ha=
s been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to comp=
lain about timing.

Shelley,
I'm sure she already thinks I'm difficult. I'm pretty sure the Kaz governmen=
t=20
sets the court date after your dossier is registered  there. So, if our=20
paperwork is not there yet, then how can she know that our court date will b=
e=20
in the time frame she thinks it is?
The more I try to understand everything she had told me the more confused I=20
get sometimes. It's really hard not understanding and being in on everything=
=20
involved in the process.
I don't know if she even knows how long the paper work will take. Chris told=
=20
me, when I sent mine in 5 weeks ago, that the estimate was 2 weeks for=20
translation, 2 weeks for the Kaz embassy, 2 weeks to be sent to Kaz and=20
registered. As of Monday mine is still in translation.
I really don't know what to do right now. Should we just wait until the firs=
t=20
of next week and call again and find out the status of everything?

Liz
