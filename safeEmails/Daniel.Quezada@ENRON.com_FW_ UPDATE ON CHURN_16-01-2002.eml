I just met with the move coordinator.  We are now scheduled to move to the 4=

approved.  Needless to say the churn will not have to be submitted today. =20

The following issues were discussed in the meeting today:

	Fax Machine/Lines	TBD (I will process the churn for all fax lines)
	Churn Due Date		Thursday, January 17 (tentative)
	Move Date		Tuesday, January 21 (tentative)
	Boxes			Will be moved by move team (if staff is available)
	Filing Space		Please get with your group and determine what files can be ac=
hieved if any (space is being looked at)
=09
Once move to locations have been determined an email will need to be sent to=
 your group requesting that they go to that location box the items if any an=
d label the boxes with the name, location and unit(label with flag nearest t=
o that location).

Thanks=20

and once I provide you with your new locations you can plug them in.

For coding please use your current cost center and company number.  For mana=
ger information please put my contact information.  This information is used=
 by the move team as an alternate contact for questions regarding your churn=
=2E  I will also need to get with you on whether or not you need to move any=
 additional equipment other than the phone line for your group.  Equipment w=
ill only be moved if the location you will be moving into does not have that=

ent must be moved.  I realize the inconvenience this may cause and apologize=
 in advance. =20
