Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) conf=
identiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, t=
he need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the ident=
ity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contac=
t information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular c=
ounterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of=
 the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cl=
eansed.

Why is this necessary in the first place? I really do not understand why it =

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to de=
lete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining=
 access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be wa=
rned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  Howev=
er, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this informati=
on would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to=
 delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?
