Chris,

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weathe=
r=20
group.

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense=
=20
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to=
=20
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London=
=20
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

Vince

Tony was hired to work for Global Markets.   Think costs should be assigned=20
to Vince or Mark but if you
believe those costs should be for my group let me know.=20

I now have Tony on one of my RCs (research).  I understand he will be doing=20
weather forecasts for some or all of you, and that he has a desk allocated i=
n=20
Global.  I need to recharge his costs  - can someone please advise the right=

cost centre.

Many thanks,
