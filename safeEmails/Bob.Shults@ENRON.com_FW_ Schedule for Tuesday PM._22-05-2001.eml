Attached is a proposed test plan from HoustonStreet for tomorrow.  I have re=
served conference room 2712 beginning at 2:30 tomorrow and will escort Houst=
onStreet onto our floor at 2:30 tomorrow.  They will be allowed to set up ma=
chines from 2:30 to 3:00.  At 3:00 we will allow HoustonStreet to discuss th=
eir plan prior to our review.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do=
 testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system.=20

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from mak=
ing any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the sy=
stem.  We will simply take the review under advisement. =20

All discussions with HoustonStreet should be handled by myself or Savita. =20

If you have any questions call me on 30397.

Bob,
I'll give you a call in the AM to see about lunch.

We would like to get started between 2-2:30 setting up the machines that we
will be using during the demonstration.  This should take approximately 1/2
hour to download the correct .CAB files and ensure that the application
installs correctly.  We will need to have administrative rights on these
machines in order to facilitate the installation.

At 3:00 if we could start in a conference room for approximately 15 minutes
we can review the demonstration scenarios and our objectives.
=46rom 3:20 - 3:40 we will run through the demo scenario 1.
=46rom 3:40 - 4:00 we will run through the demo scenario 2.
=46rom 4:00 - 4:45 will be a free form testing time.
=46rom 4:45 - 5:00 wrap-up, review, Q&A.

I'm getting ready to head to the airport - If you have any questions etc,
don't hesitate to give me a call on my cell phone - 603-591-9004.  Thanks,

John Wyman
