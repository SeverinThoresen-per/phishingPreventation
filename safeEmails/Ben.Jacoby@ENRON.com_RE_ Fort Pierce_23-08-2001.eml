Outstanding - on the exclusivity - he can have one if he pays for it.  Just =

I think I have finally broken through the summer malaise in my colleagues he=
re and gotten them fired up about Fort Pierce.  In a nutshell, we are very i=
nterested in moving forward on this deal.  I'm going to put together an LOI =
which I hope to have to you before the end of the week. =20

One question - I know your senior management has a visceral dislike for any =
type of exclusivity, however my senior management is equally in love with th=
e concept.  I'd like to try to massage something along the lines of our NCPH=
 deal but we can discuss. =20

How does the rest of your week look for getting on a call to go over some of=
 this stuff?  My NCPH scars are fading, so I'm ready to re-engage!
