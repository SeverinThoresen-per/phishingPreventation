This meter has not been disconnected.  The measurement tech turned in a=20
temporary disconnect to MIPs (about 2 months ago) because the meter has not=20
flowed for approximately 4 months.  This allows the measurement tech to forg=
o=20
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service.  Scheduled=20
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice.
