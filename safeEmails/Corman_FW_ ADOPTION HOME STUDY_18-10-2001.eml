Shelley,
=20
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is =
good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is proba=
bly going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this =
taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
=20
Sorry for the delay.=20

Dear Suzanne,=20
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please=20
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite=20
102,=20
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in=20
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital=20
section.=20
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned=20
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is=20
the=20
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to=20
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is=20
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that=20
"the=20
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would=20
be=20
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian=20
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a=20
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan.=20
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any=20
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to=20
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a=20
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends=20
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything=20
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me.=20
