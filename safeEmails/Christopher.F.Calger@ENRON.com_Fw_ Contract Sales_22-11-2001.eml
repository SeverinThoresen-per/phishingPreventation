Louise,

I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.  Bradford =
did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for aep, but =
now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash. =20

If we are short np15 and we have an in the money sale to a muni that does no=
t post collateral, we could sell that customer contract to cash-rich markete=
rs - allegheny, duke, aep, dynegy

I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling brazil.=
=20

Target customers: munis, wapa, bpa,=20
