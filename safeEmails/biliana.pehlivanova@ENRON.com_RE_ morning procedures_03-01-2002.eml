I only have the notes that I took while Chance was training me. They are det=
ailed as well, but I don't have them in Excel. Chance probably has his Excel=
 copy - I'm not sure if that's the same that Chuck made.

Biliana,

Do you have a copy of the detailed procedures that Chuck prepared for the mo=
