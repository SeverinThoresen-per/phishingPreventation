To the Editor:=20
Paul Krugman misunderstands Enron, the people who work here and the botched =
California regulatory system (column, Aug. 17). The broader goal of his late=
st attack on Enron appears to be to discredit the free-market system, a syst=
em that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor,=
 skill, intellect and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of monopol=
ies controlled or sponsored by government to make choices for people. We dis=
agree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of su=
ch institutions and their leaders.
The example Mr. Krugman cites of ''financialization'' run amok (the electric=
ity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with=
 active government intervention at every step. Indeed, the only winners in t=
he California fiasco were the government-owned utilities of Los Angeles, the=
 Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. The disaster that squandered the we=
alth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the =
many.=20

This year's honour roll of former chief executives is impressive and lengthe=
ning. Flemming Lindelov of Carlsberg Breweries left for a decorative arts co=
mpany, while Jeff Skilling resigned from Enron last week for "personal reaso=
ns" and the amiable Michael Bonsignore bade farewell to Honeywell.=20
While some bosses have been shown the door, there appears to be a separate p=
attern forming - chief executives leaving prematurely because life at the to=
p is too tough and stressful, raising the question as to whether the modern =
CEO has the right stuff.
And there is the pressing issue of how activist a board should be in these "=
transition" issues. Take, for example, Hewlett-Packard directors, several of=
 whom this week swore their allegiance to Carly Fiorina, the chief executive=
 whose fate has been the subject of much speculation.=20
In venture-capital-backed companies directors have traditionally been active=
 in recruiting and overseeing financial management, taking credit for succes=
s and, sometimes, distancing themselves from blame. But in public companies,=
 which have fuller management teams, directors have tended to take a back se=
at.=20
According to Roger Kenny, managing partner of Boardroom Consultant, a New Yo=
rk firm that recruits directors and senior management, boards have become mo=
re responsive to their company's performance - and are willing to act.=20
"Institutional investors have been successfully criticising boards for a lon=
g time. They have put some fibre in the backbone of the directors," said Ken=
ny.=20
Directors are now faced with preventing or mitigating CEO disasters. "In the=
 past, boards may have felt beholden to the CEO and been willing to overlook=
 mistakes, giving him time to right the ship. Today, a sense of urgency ofte=
n pervades board meetings when performance slips," he added.=20
Take the case of Lucent. "If Lucent's board had removed its CEO earlier in t=
he game, would the company be in better shape today?" asks Kenny. Or Xerox. =
"Should Xerox's board have demanded more information about strategic executi=
on from the new CEO before the strategy foundered?"=20
There are no sure answers but the short period that many CEOs remain in the =
job - on average four years - suggests it is tough to satisfy shareholders a=
nd directors, particularly during a downturn.=20
"One of the great revelations of the past year has been the capacity of a CE=
O to destroy value in a very short period of time," said David Nadler, chair=
man of Mercer Delta Consultants.=20
Boards need to act pre-emptively to reduce the risk of a meltdown. The trick=
 lies in the timing. Some say boards should give CEOs more time because the =
economy can be blamed for failure. Others argue they should give the CEO les=
s time because the economy makes the situation perilous and there is no time=
 to lose.=20
"Boards struggle to balance acting swiftly (to prevent Lucent-like situation=
s) and not jumping the gun," said Kenny. "It's a fine line, especially durin=
g economic downturns such as the current one."=20
Kenny says there are a number of steps a board can take to prevent CEO failu=
re, including becoming involved in CEO succession and doing "whatever it tak=
es" to become familiar with the company's core business strategy.=20
And tradition is important. The Hewlett-Packard directors insisted that Fior=
ina was faithful to the founders' dream - until then, there had been outside=
 speculation that, for Fiorina, it would be the HP way or the highway.=20

SAFETY inspectors investigating a power station explosion which killed three=
 workers have so far found no evidence of mechanical failure.=20
Andy Sherwood, 36, and Darren Higgins, 28, caught the full brunt of the blas=
t in a transformer at Enron's Teesside Power Station at Grangetown, Middlesb=
rough, on August 8 and could only be identified from dental records.
Colleague Lawrence Surtees, 40, died in hospital the next day after sufferin=
g near 100 per cent burns. Graeme White, 37, is being treated in hospital fo=
r moderate burns.=20
The dead men were carrying out maintenance on the transformer at the time of=
 the explosion.=20
Vera Baird, MP for Redcar, has discussed the situation with Ian Waugh, the H=
ealth and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector in charge of the team investigati=
on. She said: "I said when this appalling tragedy occurred that I would moni=
tor the investigation on behalf of my constituents and I have been told that=
 the investigation has established that the cause was the explosion of a tra=
nsformer.=20
"I am assured that there is no fundamental hardware problem with the equipme=
nt used on the site that would be likely to cause a repetition and this will=
 be reassuring for the people who live and work nearby."=20
Less that a week after the funeral services of the men who died, the MP has =
revealed that all interviews and investigations of equipment are complete an=
d Mr Waugh is waiting for his inspectors to write their reports, which ought=
 to take about four weeks.=20
Mr Waugh will then review their findings and his final report will be sent t=
o the Teesside Coroner.=20
A copy of the report will also be sent to Cleveland Police who set up a join=
t investigation with the safety inspectors.=20
Mrs Baird's reading of the team's findings so far went unchallenged by Gover=
nment sources last night, who added that the team reserved the right to retu=
rn to the plant for a re-examination if something cropped up in the reports =
which required further investigation.=20
A spokesman for Enron said: "Assurances about the safety of Teesside Power S=
tation have been given by the site operator - Enron - to local residents and=
 industrial neighbours over the past few days as the process of restarting t=
he plant was carried out.=20
"The company is not be commenting on any possible cause of the incident on A=
ugust 8 and will not be drawn in at this stage as the investigation by the H=
SE remains incomplete."

Panel unable to find meeting point with Enron

MUMBAI: The Enron renegotiation committee, which is expected to submit its r=
eport soon, has been unable to find a meeting point with the multinational o=
ver any of the issues discussed during its meetings.=20
According to sources, the meetings with Enron were doomed right from the wor=
d go, since Enron disagreed with most of the suggestions made by the committ=
ee. This could have to do with the energy major having already decided to ex=
it the plant and not wanting to make any further compromises.
To begin with, the committee wanted to scale down the tariff from over Rs 4 =
per unit to Rs 2.07 per unit. This was not acceptable to Enron, which was wi=
lling to settle for not more than a 10 per cent reduction in tariff.=20
Enron representatives told the panel that its landed cost of LNG alone worke=
d out to Rs 2.11 per unit in power tariff. Even the offer made by states out=
sides Maharashtra to buy Enron power could not meet with a consensus, source=
s said.=20
Among the states which approached the panel to buy Enron power were Delhi, M=
P, UP, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Karnataka. However, Enron found the purchase r=
ates which ranged from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.50 impractical.=20
The committees demand to remove the dollar denomination in tariff was reject=
ed outright by Enron on the grounds that its international lenders would nev=
er agree to accept returns in Indian currency. A debt moratorium for five ye=
ars, as suggested, was also ruled out.=20
Enron was asked to bring down interest rates on its debt component to less t=
han 12 per cent. This was ruled out by the multi-national which claimed it w=
as less than the cost of its borrowings. While the projects Indian lenders a=
greed last year to cut interest rates from 21.5 per cent to 16 per cent, its=
 international lenders charge nine per cent in dollar terms.=20
Enrons return on equity too has hovered around a low of 12 per cent, since t=
he past two years, lower than the interest on its debt.=20
With a view to reducing the liability of the cash-strapped Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board (MSEB), the renegotiating committee suggested that the Da=
bhol plant be operated at a lower plant load factor (PLF) of 30 per cent. Th=
e PLF is a major bone of contention between the two parties, since the state=
 says it does not need power at a 90 per cent PLF and since tariff is predic=
ated on a PLF of 90 per cent in the power purchase agreement, irrespective o=
f the actual offtake.=20
It is learnt that Enron was asked to operate the plant at 30 per cent PLF fr=
om 2002 and scale up to 68.5 per cent in 2007 to offset the huge tariff burd=
en on MSEB. This proposal was unpalatable to Enron.=20
Another proposal which was turned down by Enron was the suggestion that the =
returns on its equity be trimmed to 16 per cent in rupee terms at 68.5 per c=
ent PLF. As of now, the DPC gets 16 per cent returns at 68.5 per cent PLF in=
 dollars with a 0.7 per cent incentive for every one per cent increase in th=
e PLF.=20
According to sources, the committee discussed abolishing the incentive compo=
nent, bringing down PLF, and pegging return in Indian currency. With the mul=
ti-national mouthing a firm No to most of the proposals, it remains to be se=
en how the Godbole report will be implemented and whether the state will see=
 yet another round of protracted litigation on the controversial project.

INDIA: ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive.
By Alan Wheatley, Asian Economics Correspondent

08/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - After six months of political stalemate, the r=
ave reviews for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's reforming budget have give=
n way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps India embraces change only i=
n a crisis.=20
In which case, a new wave of reforms might not be far away.
For unless growth picks up substantially from last year's 5.2 percent pace, =
policy experts said India would face a further deterioration in its public f=
inances and rising unemployment that could put the world's largest democracy=
 under serious strain.=20
"We can't go on without further reforms for very long because we won't be ab=
le to grow even by five percent," said Shashanka Bhide, chief economist of t=
he National Council of Applied Economic Research.=20
"So the crisis is already there. If we're not going to get six percent-plus =
growth rates, then it's a political problem."=20
There is a broad consensus - on paper - on the need for a second wave of ref=
orms to build on ground-breaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a b=
alance-of-payments crisis in 1991.=20
Because its economy is fairly closed, India has weathered the current global=
 downturn much better than most of its Asian neighbours, who would be deligh=
ted with five percent growth.=20
Still, output has slowed for two years in a row as post-reform momentum has =
petered out. And crucially, five percent growth falls far short of the 8.7 p=
ercent average needed over the next decade to achieve Prime Minister Atal Be=
hari Vajpayee's goal of doubling per capita income, currently around $460 a =
year.=20
"Eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent =
growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed, which means ther=
e will be greater social unrest," said P Chidambaram, a former finance minis=
ter.=20
"A five percent growth rate, while statistically acceptable, is simply polit=
ically unacceptable and socially unacceptable."=20
COMPETITIVE POLITICS=20
It was to raise the economy's speed limit that Sinha unveiled in his Februar=
y budget a raft of far-reaching structural reforms making it easier to fire =
workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for smal=
l and medium-sized firms.=20
The reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in India =
but they soon became mired in what the Planning Commission aptly calls the "=
compulsion of competitive politics".=20
On a charitable view, the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kale=
idoscope that is India's multi-party democracy.=20
"This is not a country, this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in=
 the political domain, the social domain and the economic domain," said Amit=
 Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce a=
nd Industry.=20
Less charitably, the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfee=
bled Vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy 19-party coalition and force mi=
nisters to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests oppo=
sed to change.=20
Arjun Sengupta, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, said the abse=
nce of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its=
 own furrow, resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly need=
ed investment.=20
"This is the main problem we have today: we do not have a coherent, unified =
policy framework," Sengupta said.=20
He said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult bec=
ause India's most populous and backward states were falling farther and fart=
her behind the better-off ones.=20
"If the Centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the sta=
tes, we are facing major problems which can become explosive," Sengupta, a f=
ormer ambassador and IMF official, said.=20
Peering through the gloom, optimists point to the precedent of legislation p=
assed without the pressure of a crisis in 1999 to open up India's insurance =
market to foreign firms.=20
They hope two equally controversial reform bills, to liberalise the crisis-r=
idden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms, will als=
o eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week, ending mo=
nths of wrangling.=20
"Anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn't looked =
at figures on poverty very closely," said Planning Commission member N.K. Si=
ngh. He said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to 27 percent fr=
om 37 percent.=20
REFORM PRIORITIES=20
The list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy. Because o=
f its pivotal role in the economy, the power sector is many experts' number =
one priority. The well-catalogued troubles that foreign firms such as Enron =
Corp have encountered dealing with India's all-but-bankrupt state power boar=
ds have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors.=20
Domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twic=
e as much as they would in China for electricity.=20
Nevertheless, attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political ro=
cks: how to end overmanning at the power boards, estimated at 50-70 percent,=
 and how to charge users, mainly farmers, market rates for stolen or heavily=
 subsidised power.=20
D.K. Srivastava, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and=
 Policy, said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be ass=
ured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek re-election two=
 or three years later.=20
"Any government under any minister will say to you, How can I survive unless=
 I can show my voters jobs?'," Srivastava said. "This is one of the basic co=
nstraints on power sector reform."=20
T.K. Bhaumik, a senior adviser at the Confederation of Indian Industry, agre=
ed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the cas=
e for change to India's mass poor.=20
"We did not articulate the economic reform process to the people," Bhaumik s=
aid. On privatisation, for instance, policy-makers did not spell out the con=
sequences for jobs.=20
"I don't think we really understood the issues properly. We simply followed =
the Washington consensus and that didn't go down well with the people," he s=
aid.=20
As Divestment Minister Arun Shourie knows only too well. The privatisation p=
rogramme he oversees, a litmus test of India's reform will, is stalled becau=
se of what Shourie calls "fractured" politics and "noise" generated by corpo=
rate interests.=20
Shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt India's politi=
cians into putting the country's interests first.=20
"We're on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and I feel the r=
eal circumstances in which India is placed will force the political class to=
 do the right thing," he said.

Calif Senate Panel To Study Muni Utils Pwr Mkt Activities

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee investigating electr=
icity market manipulation in the state will continue its activities past the=
 legislature's Sept. 14 adjournment date, and will look into prices charged =
by municipal utilities as well as by private generators, said committee Chai=
rman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, Tuesday.=20
"We had to prioritize who we would investigate first. We started with genera=
tors, then expanded to traders and we're also going to look at the state's u=
tilities. We've already made document requests of the Los Angeles Department=
 of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District," Dunn sai=
d.
Dunn said the LADWP hasn't provided all documents to the committee, though t=
hey have indicated they are happy to cooperate.=20
"It's taken LADWP a while. It doesn't seem to be the case that they are with=
holding those documents, though we don't have them all," Dunn said.=20
No one at LADWP was available to comment on the matter.=20
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has cited Enr=
on Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt for refusing to provid=
e certain documents. If the full Senate approves those contempt charges, the=
 companies could be punished, most likely with fines.=20
A study by trade group Independent Energy Producers Association found that R=
eliant and Enron Power Marketing Inc. charged the state's power-buying arm l=
ess than the average price of $269 a megawatt-hour for electricity in Januar=
y through March. The LADWP and SMUD charged more than the average.=20
The committee's next hearing will be in the first week of September, Dunn sa=
id. Hearings throughout the fall will concentrate on depositions, he added.=20

Fired Calif DWR Traders Had Access To ISO's Control Room
By Bryan Lee

08/21/2001

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Four of the five California Department of Water Res=
ources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had a=
ccess to the state electricity grid operator's control room.
That revelation was contained in a recent letter to the House Government Ref=
orm Committee from Terry Winter, the California Independent System Operator'=
s president and chief executive.=20
The letter responded to House lawmakers' concerns, voiced during an Aug. 2 h=
earing, about DWR power traders having access to the ISO's control room floo=
r and the wealth of market-sensitive information available there.=20
Rep. Doug Ose, R-Calif., who chairs the committee's energy policy panel, sai=
d access to the ISO's control room allowed DWR traders to "cherrypick" power=
 purchases, and led federal regulators to exclude DWR purchases from conside=
ration in a recent landmark refund order.=20
The five fired DWR traders owned stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN), a major power=
 provider in California.=20
The four fired DWR employees with access to the ISO control room were Willia=
m Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Chung. The fifth, Richard =
Ferreiro, wasn't among those Winter listed as having control-room access. Ne=
ither did Elaine Griffin, who resigned after it was learned she owned Calpin=
e stock.=20
They were among 14 DWR employees who had their control-room access privilege=
s terminated by the ISO over the past two months. The others had their badge=
s deactivated because they either hadn't filed necessary confidentiality sta=
tements or hadn't been using their badges to access the ISO control room, sa=
id Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman.=20
Nine DWR power traders still enjoy access to the ISO control room, according=
 to Winter's letter to Ose. Among them is Bernard Barretto, who reportedly o=
wns stock in Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis who recently sold=
 Calpine stock after conflict-of-interest concerns were raised, said earlier=
 this month that Barretto's investment met state ethics rules because Enron =
wasn't making sales in the spot market, where the DWR employee was involved =
in making power purchases.=20
DWR employees' investments are "thoroughly reviewed" to make sure there are =
no conflicts, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said. Employees must either divest=
 their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial in=
terests, Hidalgo said.=20
An Ose spokesman, Yier Shi, said the congressman believes the arrangement ha=
s worked against the interests of California consumers.=20
"It's pretty obvious that it isn't in the interest of California consumers, =
the DWR or the ISO to have that conflict of interest in the power-purchasing=
 process," Shi said.=20
"Why is DWR getting preferential access? That's the core issue," Shi added.=20
Allowing DWR power traders into the ISO control room is "a real conflict bec=
ause DWR is the major buyer in the state," said Lynne Church, president of t=
he Electric Power Supply Association, whose members include many of the comp=
anies that own power plants in California.=20
"Having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers i=
nto shorter-term markets are charging, (including) what's being sold and to =
whom," Church said.=20
"Any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of acc=
ess," she said, noting that no other grid operator in the country allows tha=
t sort of access. "It's just unconscionable for them to have that kind of ac=
cess to market intelligence."=20
During the Aug. 2 hearing that Ose chaired, Winter agreed that having DWR em=
ployees in the control room was a problem. The ISO is "working very hard to =
get them out," he said.=20
The access was provided back in January, after the DWR was forced to begin p=
urchasing what since then has amounted to about $10 billion in power on beha=
lf of the state's bankrupt and near-bankrupt investor-owned utilities, Pacif=
ic Gas & Electric Co. (PCG) and Southern California Edison Co. (EIX).=20
Power providers were balking at continuing to sell power to California unles=
s they were assured of creditworthy buyers. And the DWR refused to take on t=
he responsibility unless the ISO granted the agency access to the control ro=
om, Winter told Ose's subcommittee.=20
The arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts, he said.=20
The DWR will withdraw its employees from the ISO control room effective Sept=
=2E 1, Pete Garris, who oversees power purchases for the DWR, announced over=
 the weekend.=20
"It wasn't our intent to be there on a permanent basis," said Hidalgo, the D=
WR spokesman, who described the privilege as "a temporary move to keep the l=
ights on."=20
Now that the state's electricity crisis has lessened, the DWR's "goal" is to=
 have the traders out of the ISO control room by Sept. 1, Hidalgo said.=20
"We're pleased to see that the DWR is working toward resolving its conflict =
of interest problems with the ISO," said Shi, the Ose aide. "We hope this ch=
ange of policy isn't too little too late for California consumers to win ref=
unds."=20
