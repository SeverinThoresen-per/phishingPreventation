Sta. 3 and 4, I am sending to you via regular mail, the new air permits for =
the Redrock Expansion.  I will be contacting you in the near future about co=
ming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between yo=
u and me.  If you get some time, I would suggest that you look over each per=
mit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is o=
n your existing permit.  the old permit will expire when the facility begins=
 operation of the turbine.  For Station 4, if a turbine is not installed at =
your location, this new permit wont apply.  But in the event it happens, you=
 have the permit.

Bottom line, you need to keep this permit at each location.   =20
