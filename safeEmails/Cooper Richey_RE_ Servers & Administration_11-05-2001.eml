As far as Houston standards, they made sense to me and they seemed to have m=
ore expertise in the matter. =20

How bad did things get yesterday?

Cooper -

I think that the three of us should talk about this... however, unless Tim H=
 disagrees, we should probably wait until after he has completed the schedul=
ed meeting(s) that he has with PDX & Houston IT regarding the current policy=
 issues. These meeting(s) should happen today or tomorrow. In the mean time,=
 I will review this document.

Clarification question: If we agree that, ideally, Houston is not going to h=
andle administration of these servers, what is the basis of the decision to =
follow Houston standards? Is it that you agree with their conclusions or tha=
t you want to stay compliant? Just curious...

As you point out, these issues have been long-time coming -- and if what hap=
pened yesterday is the price that we have to pay to get things running as sm=
oothly and reliably as possible, then I am glad that it happened. Relative t=
o the good that can come from this, we got a bargain!

Take Care,
Bob

While our webserver up here hasn't been hammered yet, I've been concerned=20
about similar issues (web hardware and administration) for awhile up here. =20
Given that the web is our primary medium I agree with you and Tim that it's =
been=20
neglected. =20

Administration is an ongoing issue and I'm not sure what a good solution for=
 this is,
but relying on Houston for this is not an option as far as I'm concerned (un=
less they
change their draconian policies).  At the moment Chris Wiebe is officially a=
dministrating
our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I=
've been relying
on Colin for most day-to-day admin.  This isn't great since Colin is a contr=
actor.  We should
definitely team up on this one as I don't think IIS administration is even a=
 quarter-time job,
but it is vital.  I'm in a similar spot on SQL Server issues - Chris is the =
admin, but he's moving
more toward the development side of IT with each passing week. =20

In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through Dan Dietrich a=
nd spoke
with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.  He=
 sent me
the following documentation standard which I hope I forwarded onto you (as i=
t's quite
good).  I'm pushing to move to the Houston standard for web servers which is=
 two=20
clustered pizza boxes (DL360s).    I just got the price quote for these and =
it would be=20
about 9000 US$ for the two boxes (basically dual proc PIII 930, 512 MB RAM, =
2 9GB drives)

You mentioned moving the dev environment from prod, but I'm not sure if you'=
re interested
in splitting the web from the file server.  I think this is a good idea (mor=
e for file server reliability
than anything else.)  There's some time critical data up here that we can't =
recover if we=20
miss it the first time, so I'm trying to make the backend as fault-tolerant =
as possible.  plus,
it seems like it's likely a cheap performance and fault tolerance boost for =
the web, as well. =20

Sorry to hear about your web troubles yesterday, but hopefully it will serve=
 as a catalyst
for us to clean things up. =20

Should we set up a call to talk about this? =20

Cooper -

You may or may not be aware that our production web server got hit pretty ha=
rd yesterday. It has yet to be "officially" determined what happened, so I w=
on't give you my opinion... however, many issues that have been festering fo=
r some time were brought into the spot light through this ordeal.

At this point, Tim H. and I have agreed on two immediate actions that will b=
e taken.
	1) Our development server needs to be moved to a separate physical box. Thi=
s will serve as the back-up and fail-over server as well.
	2) Paul Kane and I will pursue IIS administration and security training/cer=
tification.

It is our firm intention that any and all administration on either of these =
boxes will be done by us -- not Houston. Although, this argument has yet to =
take place.

In light of the working relationship between PDX and Calgary (that we only a=
nticipate growing stronger through this), I would like to hear what conclusi=
ons you have come to with the research that you have done regarding hardware=
 and software -- as well as any suggestions that you may have that we should=
 consider. We want to make sure that, with whatever avenue is taken,  we mai=
ntain a position of compatibility to share resources and technology with Cal=
gary Fundies...

Thanks!
Bob
