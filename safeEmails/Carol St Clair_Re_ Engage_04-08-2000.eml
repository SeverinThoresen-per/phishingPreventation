I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open=20
issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney=
=20
which he never responded to.

Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. =20
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded=
=20
to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the=20
Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and th=
e=20
latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your syste=
m=20
and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their=
=20
attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to=20
you.

Hi Carol,=20

Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you=
=20
are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further=20
information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on=20
this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to=20
cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they=20
issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like t=
o=20
know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA=20
amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up.

Hope all is well,

Russell
