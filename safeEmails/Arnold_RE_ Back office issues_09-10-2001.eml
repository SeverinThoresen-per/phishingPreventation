If these problems are not being addressed as they should be, call me and I'l=

Fred-=20

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures =
immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad re=
putation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday aftern=
oon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample o=
f some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added =
in the last 6 months. =20

"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmation=
s you send out"=20
"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of pape=
r to give us the details of the trade"=20
"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoic=
ed for"=20
"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even=
 think before you type"=20
"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to co=
nfirm here"=20


=46rom a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to lar=
ge industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said =
"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was =
such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the c=
onfirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not sh=
ow us their flow again.=20

The latest is the most disturbing:

"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a=
 nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to=
 book the purchase of 50 lots of crude" And still 5 days later they do not h=
ave one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade..=
=2Enothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make =
best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, cl=
early we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they a=
re too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral the=
ir accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they t=
rained?  Who is in charge of the "backoffice"?  There seems to be a differen=
t manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts=
?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming=
 up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she st=
arted but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will). =20

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  T=
his has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. th=
ey are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get the=
se right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are ent=
ered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of th=
em.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from eve=
ry book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will =
always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterda=
y.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the repor=
t she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always=
 mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects =
the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after th=
ey have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check=
 every deal after its entered into the system going forward. =20

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea w=
here our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like =
gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to fi=
nish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals ar=
e imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion=
 at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can con=
firm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we ar=
e invoicing do not match the deals done..=20

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed R=
enaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at=
 these tasks. =20

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system inco=
rrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work clos=
ely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. =
this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with cli=
ents and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.
