As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adap=
t our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during thi=
s time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate =
suspension of the following programs.

=B7	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program =
will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service order=
s.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honore=
d.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective Janu=
ary 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet =
service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service pro=
vider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
=B7	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching =
Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we conside=
r the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is approp=
riate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contrib=
utions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with=
 non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior =
to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look =
for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.
