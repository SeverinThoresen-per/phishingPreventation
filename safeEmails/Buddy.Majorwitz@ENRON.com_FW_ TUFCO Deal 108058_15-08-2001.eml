Darin,

Since the volume on this ENA deal is on PGEV (EPGT Texas) Pipeline, the ENA =
Volume Management contact is Hakeem Ogunbunmi.  His number is X-31801 and he=
 has been cc'd on this note. =20

FYI - ENA Volume Management has assumed all of the volume duties associated =
with all Texas deals that are not specifically on Houston Pipe Line.  For th=
ose on Houston Pipe Line, I will still be the contact.  If you have any ques=
tions, please let me know.

Buddy
X-31933

Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058,=
 that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, i=
t was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into thi=
s and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please ge=
t back with him directly.  Thanks.
