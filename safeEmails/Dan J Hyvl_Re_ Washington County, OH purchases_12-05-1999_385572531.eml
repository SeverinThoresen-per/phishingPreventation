I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a=20
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy. =20
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas=20
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are=20
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in=20
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas=20
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see=
=20
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is=
=20
this ECT's gas?  MDS
