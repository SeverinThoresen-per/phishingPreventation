Enron's India Unit Says Pleased With Supreme Court Ruling

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co. said Monday it was "extremely pleas=
ed" with the Indian Supreme Court's ruling that asked the Bombay High Court =
to decide on Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction in=
 settling DPC's $48 million payment dispute with Maharashtra State Electrici=
ty Board.=20
DPC is a unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE).
"The favorable ruling gives further support to DPC's faith in the Indian leg=
al system. The Supreme Court took note of DPC's argument that members of the=
 MERC had previously published articles and position papers against the Dabh=
ol project," said a DPC statement.=20
"Although the court didn't rule on the question of MERC's bias, the court re=
cognized the seriousness of potential bias and agreed that the matter could =
be heard before the Bombay High Court and not MERC," the statement added.=20
Enron Corp. holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol Power Co., which operate=
s a 740-megawatt power plant in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.=20
DPC is embroiled in a long-standing dispute with its sole buyer MSEB over pa=
yments for electricity. MSEB stopped drawing power from DPC May 29, saying i=
ts tariffs were "unaffordable." DPC had earlier approached the Bombay High C=
ourt for redress of its grievances. It later appealed to the country's Supre=
me Court for justice.=20
Valued at $2.9 billion, the Dabhol project is the single largest foreign inv=
estment in India.=20

INDIA: Indian top court rules in Enron's favour-companies.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Aug 6 (Reuters) - India's highest court on Monday ruled in favour of=
 U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in its ongoing di=
spute with a local utility over high tariffs and payment defaults, the utili=
ty's head said.=20
The Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling in June, Maharashtra Sta=
te Electricity Board chairman Vinay Bansal told Reuters.
"They have allowed Dabhol's petition and set aside the order of the Bombay h=
igh court," he said.=20
The Supreme Court has asked the high court to decide whether Dabhol can take=
 the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration in London.=20
"The favourable ruling on the issue by the Supreme Court gives further suppo=
rt to DPC's historical faith in the Indian legal system," a Dabhol statement=
 said.=20
The current round of litigation was sparked off when the Maharashtra Electri=
city Regulatory Commission said the power company's dispute with the state u=
tility fell within its ambit and Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitrati=
on.=20
Dabhol then petitioned the high court, asking it to decide whether it could =
indeed take the dispute to London.=20
On June 26, the high court rejected Dabhol's petition, saying the provincial=
 regulator was empowered to take that decision.=20
Dabhol then appealed to the Supreme Court.=20
BITTER BATTLE=20
Dabhol and the Board are locked in a bitter battle over a 2,184 MW power pla=
nt Enron's subsidiary is building in two phases on the western coast of Indi=
a.=20
At the centre of the dispute is the power purchase agreement, a contract tha=
t governs the terms of Dabhol's sale and the Board's purchase of electricity=
=2E=20
Dabhol claims the utility has violated several clauses in this contract and =
wants the dispute to be resolved by the International Court of Arbitration.=20
The Board cites its own clauses that it says Enron's unit has violated and i=

Enron Wins Indian Court Decision Over Power Dispute Arbitration
2001-08-06 07:14 (New York)

Enron Wins Indian Court Decision Over Power Dispute Arbitration

     Mumbai, Aug. 6 (Bloomberg) -- India's highest court blocked
an attempt by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board to have a
provincial regulator arbitrate its dispute with Enron Corp. over
$64 million in unpaid power bills.
     The New Delhi-based Supreme Court ruled that the seven-month
old dispute must be settled through the Mumbai High Court and not
the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, which was set
up in 1999 to regulate the power industry in the western Indian
state.
     The ruling is a victory for Enron, whose Dabhol Power Co.
unit in May began proceedings to end the seven-year-old power
supply contract with Maharashtra, its sole customer, because of
the debt. The state's electricity board, in response, stopped
buying Dabhol's power, saying it's too expensive, prompting the
generator to halt production.
     The ruling is ``favorable,'' said Enron in a statement.
     Dabhol has argued that the board didn't have the right to
cancel the contract, and the board referred the dispute to the
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.
     Dabhol argued the regulator was created in 1999, after the
power purchase contract was signed, and therefore didn't have the
authority to decide the dispute.
     Dabhol's $3 billion plant, India's biggest foreign direct
investment, can generate 740 megawatts of power and the company
had planned to add another 2,184 megawatts of capacity this year.

India: Uncertain fate of LNG carrier

Business Line (The Hindu)

THE top brass of Enron, the Shipping Corporation of India and Mitsui-OSK Lin=
e have assembled in Tokyo to decide the fate of Laxmi, the 1.37-lakh cubic m=
etre capacity LNG carrier, being built in a Japanese yard.=20
Laxmi belongs to Greenfield Shipping, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greenfiel=
d Holdings, promoted by the three companies. It is supposed to transport LNG=
 from Oman and Abu Dhabi for the power plant being set up by Enron's Dabhol =
Power Company (DPC) at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.
With Enron threatening to pull out of DPC, the fate of Laxmi has become some=
what uncertain.=20
The objective of the Tokyo meeting is two-fold. First, the Greenfield partne=
rs will review the situation arising out of Enron's threat to pull out of DP=
C and, second, they will meet representatives of ANZ Investment Bank and 13 =
other lenders, funding acquisition of the vessel.=20
ANZ Investment Bank is the leader of the 14-member consortium of lenders.=20
The Greenfield partners have declined to give additional securities, which t=
he lenders are insisting on. The lenders, who have already declared "an even=
t of default" in view of uncertainty over the DPC's project, are believed to=
 have threatened to hold back the payment of the last instalment, amounting =
to $55 million, in the event of non-availability of additional securities. T=
he disbursement of the last instalment is due at the time of delivery of the=
 vessel in the middle of November. ANZ Investment Bank and others in the con=
sortium will part-fund the cost of Laxmi. Together, these lenders are to pro=
vide $165 million as loans, of which $110 million has already been disbursed=
=2E=20
The vessel will finally cost about $230 million (its core cost being $189 mi=
llion).=20
The anxiety of the lenders is understandable. With Enron threatening to pull=
 out of DPC, leading financial institutions and banks, earlier supporting th=
e project, have already stopped releasing funds to DPC.=20
ANZ Investment Bank and other lenders, therefore, apprehend that DPC, the ch=
arterer of the vessel, might find it hard to pay the charter hire. Hence, th=
ere is a threat to withhold the disbursement of the last instalment.=20
All these developments are taking place at a time when construction of the v=
essel is nearly complete. The vessel is due to be delivered in November, whi=
le DPC's LNG-based power project is due to be commissioned in end-2001 or ea=
rly 2002.=20
The Greenfield partners are, however, not unduly worried over the probable d=
eployment of Laxmi in case the proposed LNG transportation for the DPC plant=
 comes a cropper. "It can be deployed on spot charter, and profitably," obse=
rve sources, pointing out that the global trend in the past one year suggest=
s that LNG carriers are increasingly being offered on spot charters.=20
True, 95 per cent of the 120-odd LNG vessels of the world are still dedicate=
d to certain projects, but the share of LNG ships on spot charter today is a=
bout five per cent, up from one per cent a year ago. This is considered a si=
gnificant development.=20
In fact, Mitsui-OSK Line, which controls nearly one- third of the world's to=
tal LNG tonnage, is believed to be confident about deploying Laxmi on spot c=
harter profitably, in case it is freed from the DPC project.=20
Shipping sources said several LNG vessels already under construction are not=
 tied to any project. For example, Shell, which by way of liquification, reg=
asification and transportation through STASCO, is associated with nearly 60 =
per cent of the world's LNG business, has ordered four LNG carriers, none of=
 them being tied to given projects. The same is true about several other wor=
ld leaders in the field.=20
Laxmi will be delivered at a time when the demand for LNG is expected to pic=
k up as the entire western world will then be in the throes of winter. That =
will also be the time when the charter rates for LNG carriers is expected to=
 shoot up. It will be another two years or so before LNG vessels currently o=
n order are delivered. Till then, the spot demand for LNG vessels will persi=
st, it is felt.=20
However, one disadvantage of spot chartering is that it might imply a certai=
n amount of idling of vessels. Also, one cannot be sure if the spotting will=
 yield the same freight earning for Laxmi as has been fixed for DPC. The con=
tract for LNG transportation for the DPC project was signed for 20 years at =
a confirmed rate of $97,600 per day.=20
Alternatively, Laxmi can be put on one- year charter. Greenfield sources see=
m convinced that DPC's LNG- based power plant shall be commissioned someday,=
 if not by Enron, then by any other promoter. After all, the $3-billion proj=
ect, having made considerable progress, cannot now be scrapped.=20

Too Much Power? The utility industry's in a building boom. Why skeptics fear=
 a bust.
By Harlan S. Byrne

08/06/2001
Barron's
21
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Hardly a day went by last year without an announcement that a new electric p=
ower plant had been planned or put under construction somewhere in the U.S. =
And who could blame the utility industry for its zealous building binge? Pol=
iticians were wringing their hands about an energy crisis in full view of th=
e television cameras. The price of electricity was surging from Montauk to M=
alibu. Meanwhile, all across California the seething citizenry was sitting i=
n the dark.=20
In recent months, however, the blackouts have abated and the lights have com=
e on again. Electric bills are falling and the politicians have moved on. Bu=
t the utility industry's troubles are only just beginning, say several consu=
lting firms and some candid, and canny, insiders. The industry, they fear, i=
s in the midst of a building boom that could result in a widespread financia=
l bust.
By some counts the power industry plans to add as much as 290,000 megawatts =
of generating capacity over the next six years, which would represent an inc=
rease of almost 40% to current capacity of 760,000 megawatts of power. At th=
e same time, the forward price curve for electric power, which tracks bid an=
d asked prices for power delivered at specified future points, has been tren=
ding down. This has led some industry observers to predict a power glut, wit=
h potentially ugly consequences for firms that are forced to carry unused ge=
nerating capacity.=20
William McCormick Jr., chief executive of CMS Energy, a large electric power=
 producer in Dearborn, Michigan, doesn't mince his words. "Just in Michigan,=
 there are 9,000 megawatts of new power that are planned but probably won't =
be needed anytime soon," he says.=20
Most of this power will be generated by new plants built by so-called mercha=
nt power producers, which sell their output in unregulated markets. If activ=
ated, they would increase the margin for capacity reserved for emergencies t=
o an unnecessarily high 35%, from a current 15%.=20
McCormick and others believe that Michigan may well be a microcosm of the na=
tion as a whole. Says E. Linn Draper Jr., chief executive of American Electr=
ic Power, the largest U.S. power producer, "The question is how low the forw=
ard price curve will go, and whether future power prices will allow investor=
s in power plants to recover their outlays for new generation."=20
It is impossible to measure at this early date the aggregate financial damag=
e that the industry might incur if its best-laid plans, and plants, ultimate=
ly do not provide adequate returns. Some consultants have suggested that 20%=
-30% of the plans announced for new facilities eventually will be shelved, a=
nd Electricity Daily, a well-regarded industry publication, already has repo=
rted scattered cancellations and deferrals around the country. A typical bas=
eload plant generating 1,000 megawatts costs an average $500 million to buil=
d, although prices can vary widely by location and specifications.=20
Wall Street, too, has begun to realize that too much of a good thing may be =
just that -- too much. Last year the Standard & Poor's electric utility inde=
x rang up gains of more than 40%, as many investors fleeing technology share=
s sought refuge in the group. This year, however, the utility index is down =
10.4, compared with the S&P 500's 8% decline, and a drop of 2.5% in the Dow =
Jones industrial average.=20
Utility stocks traditionally have lured investors with their fat dividend yi=
elds. But even that attraction may be dimming, as companies turn their atten=
tion to plowing cash into expansion.=20
Among the industry's biggest players, Duke Energy has fallen 16%, to 40, and=
 Southern 1.2%, to 23.60, from their respective 52-week peaks. The leading i=
ndependent power producers have suffered even more. Shares of AES have skidd=
ed 46.6%, to 38.90, from last fall's high of 72.81, while Calpine has droppe=
d 36.6%, to 36.80, since hitting a high of 58 in April.=20
One New York money manager who has foreseen a capacity glut for some time, a=
nd who asked not to be quoted by name, says he's "aggressively shorting" Gen=
eral Electric. The stock, now 42.20 a share, has fallen 12% this year. GE's =
power systems unit, the leading manufacturer of gas turbines for power gener=
ation, has been a big beneficiary of the power-plant building boom, along wi=
th Siemens and some smaller equipment makers. "We'll probably be at our orde=
r and sales peak for domestic turbine deliveries this year and next," says D=
elbert A. Williamson, president of global sales for the power systems divisi=
on.=20
Williamson says its possible GE will sell out for 2003, as well, but it's no=
t nailed down yet. The company has received some orders for delivery of gas =
turbines in 2004, but he doesn't yet view this order-flow as an indicator of=
 a trend. On the other hand, Williamson sees signs of a pick-up in orders fr=
om Europe and the Middle East that could partially offset what looks like a =
slowdown in domestic sales two or three years from now.=20
After struggling for business in the mid-1990s, GE's power systems unit has =
become a major contributor to the company's earnings growth. Segment profits=
 more than doubled since 1998, reaching $2.8 billion last year. Profits near=
ly doubled again in the first half of this year, to $2.2 billion from $1.2 b=
illion a year ago. But the aforementioned short-seller says "a lot of invest=
ors will start waking up late next year and belatedly discover that a power =
glut isn't far off." Williamson says he's unaware of any order cancellations=
, and probably wouldn't expect any for another 24 months, in accordance with=
 the terms of most sales.=20
Given the rosy long-term outlook for electricity demand, supply constraints =
eventually are bound to reappear. But near-term concerns about excessive gen=
erating capacity aren't all that surprising, either. Boom and bust cycles ar=
e endemic to commodities businesses, from steel to paper to power. Whenever =
there is a need, and the price is right, supply will rush in to meet demand.=
=20
By way of illustration, John W. Rowe, co-chief executive of Exelon, a Chicag=
o-based energy holding company, recently testified at Senate hearings on Pre=
sident Bush's proposals to boost energy supplies. Rowe observed that in the =
five years through 1999, electric demand increased by 9.5% while additions t=
o generating capacity rose only 1.6%. He cited the dramatic rise in electric=
ity prices, until recently anyway, as "proof positive" of what happens when =
capacity doesn't keep pace with demand.=20
The electric utility market has wrestled with overcapacity in the past, but =
never in the memory of industry veterans has the problem loomed as large as =
today. That's because almost no new plants were constructed in recent years,=
 as the industry coped with the fallout from deregulation. The wholesale mar=
ket was deregulated six years ago by federal decree, and the industry has be=
en further liberated on a state-by-state basis since. But the process was ma=
rked by political wrangling between consumer and other special-interest grou=
ps, and the outlook remained uncertain in many parts of the country until fa=
irly recently.=20
The upshot was a general reluctance industrywide to commit to large capacity=
 expansions. As a result, the regulated utilities erected only a few power p=
lants over a five-year span. This paved the way for several independent gene=
rators of power to thrive, and in the past two years catapulted the leaders =
in that market, AES and Calpine, into the growth-stock leagues.=20
Calpine, in particular, achieved star status, and its shares quadrupled as t=
he San Jose company's earnings soared. Last year Calpine posted earnings of =
$325 million, or $1.11 a share, on revenues of $2.3 billion, compared with n=
et of $96.2 million, or 43 cents a share, on $848 million in revenues in 199=
9. In the latest quarter earnings more than doubled to $132 million, or 32 c=
ents a share, while revenues more than tripled, to $1.6 billion.=20
Yet, investors no longer seem quite as dazzled by the company's plans to bui=
ld or acquire up to 70,000 megawatts of capacity by 2005, which would repres=
ent a 10-fold increase over current capacity of 7,000 megawatts of power. Ca=
lpine, too, must recognize that its ambitious plans could face some roadbloc=
ks ahead. Recently the company has turned much of its attention to expanding=
 outside this country, in places such as the United Kingdom and Canada.=20
If Calpine manages to realize its goals, however, the company could become o=
ne of the largest, if not the largest, U.S. power generator. It would be the=
 leader of a spunky pack of merchant power producers, although it currently =
lacks the extensive power-marketing operations of some others in the field.=20
Many regulated utilities also have been captivated by the potential for prof=
its from wholesale and trading activities. Some frankly trumpet the wholesal=
e trading of power as their main growth initiative, and a few have spun off =
or otherwise separated for operating purposes their unregulated operations. =
Mirant, a former subsidiary of Southern, came public last September, and aft=
er a rough start its shares spiked up to 47 from 20-21. The stock now trades=
 around 33. Other prominent independents include Reliant Resources, spun out=
 of Reliant Energy in May 2001; NRG Energy, an offshoot of Xcel Energy, and =
Aquila, which was recently taken public by parent UtiliCorp.=20
Other power providers, including industry giants Duke Energy and American El=
ectric Power, have been contemplating similar spinoffs. In part, the indepen=
dents are hoping to emulate Enron, one of the largest traders of wholesale p=
ower.=20
While brokerage analysts generally have applauded the utilities' drive to ex=
ploit wholesale trading, some are now growing wary about the possible financ=
ial consequences of an energy glut. That's because a recent and unexpectedly=
 sharp decline in power prices has raised red flags about the industry's fut=
ure earnings from the sale of wholesale power. According to statistics compi=
led for Barron's by McGraw Hill-Platts, a prominent trade publisher, wholesa=
le electric prices nationwide have dropped to less than $50 per megawatt hou=
r, and in some areas to $40, from about $125 in May. Late last year power in=
 California fetched a stunning $1,000 per megawatt hour, while the national =
average soared above $200 in December. In part it was this sort of price act=
ion that spurred orders for new plants, as merchant power producers and othe=
rs envisioned printing money.=20
The forward price curve, which peaked in early April, tells a similarly sobe=
ring tale. According to Platts, the cost of power bought in the mid-Atlantic=
 region for delivery in 2002 then sold for about $51 per megawatt hour. The =
price since has fallen to $38. Power for 2003 would have cost $44 per megawa=
tt hour, and now it's $36. In the main hub in California, meanwhile, power f=
or 2003 has fallen to $41 from an April high of $73.=20
Two weeks ago Raymond Niles, a utility analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, issu=
ed a cautionary note about power prices, noting that June was the first mont=
h this year to show a year-to-year decline in electric prices, and a violent=
 one at that. Niles sees worsening comparisons ahead, which prompted him to =
cut his earnings estimates and price targets for several utilities, includin=
g Entergy, Xcel and UtiliCorp.=20
Steve Fleishman, of Merrill Lynch, long considered one of the top utility an=
alysts, also has begun to acknowledge a potential power glut. But he's quick=
 to give the weather and economy their due in guiding supply and demand. By =
Fleishman's reckoning 45,000 megawatts of new capacity will be added to the =
market next year. But demand has been dampened by a weak economy, lower powe=
r prices stemming, in part, from federally imposed price caps in California,=
 and cooler summer weather throughout the U.S., which has led to cutbacks in=
 air-conditioning loads. Fleishman maintains power prices may get weaker sti=
ll before rebounding.=20
Lowell Miller, a money manager specializing in utility shares, thinks the st=
ocks are still vulnerable precisely because they were accorded glamour statu=
s by some fans on the Street. Once considered the province of risk-averse in=
vestors, they migrated last year into the hands of the growth-oriented crowd=
=2E=20
Ruth Ann Gillis, the chief financial officer of Exelon, concurs. The company=
's stock recently dropped more than five points in two days, even after the =
company, which was formed by the merger of Philadelphia's PECO Energy and Ch=
icago-based Unicom, posted strong second-quarter earnings, and predicted fur=
ther gains. "The momentum crowd took over the trading in utility shares afte=
r dumping technology stocks," she says. "Now they may be getting out."=20
The managers of the nation's biggest electric utilities are mixed in their a=
ssessments of the threat of a power glut, and in their tactics to combat it.=
 Linn Draper, of AEP, sticks by what he calls a contrarian view about new ge=
neration. AEP, he notes, is meeting increased demand through its merger with=
 Central & South West, which was completed in June 2000, and is increasing i=
ts operating efficiency by upgrading equipment and procedures. The company h=
as entered into joint ventures with chemical companies for new plants, but D=
raper emphasizes that AEP has refrained from building new plants on its own.=
=20
Initially, he says, the company's Wall Street followers failed to appreciate=
 why the utility didn't follow the trail blazed by more aggressive producers=
, such as Calpine, Duke and Mirant. But with power prices falling, Draper fe=
els that AEP's stance will be vindicated. The company based its predictions =
for future supply and demand on both published price curves and its own inte=
rnal analysis, he notes.=20
Draper's on the same page as the rest of the industry, however, in viewing t=
he wholesaling and trading of unregulated power as the best avenue to earnin=
gs growth. (In addition to being the nation's largest electric power produce=
r, with nearly 40,000 megawatts of capacity, AEP claims it's No. 2, behind E=
nron, in trading electric power and gas.) The bulk of the 85% growth in the =
company's second-quarter earnings, which totaled $287 million, or 89 cents a=
 share, came from wholesale electric and gas operations. AEP expects to earn=
 $3.50-$3.60 for the full year, and $3.75-$3.85 in 2002.=20
Duke Energy, another giant in electric and gas operations, has taken a somew=
hat more aggressive stance than AEP in capacity additions. Richard B. Priory=
, the company's chief executive, doesn't seem surprised by the industry's ag=
gressive building plans, given that many utilities, several years back, were=
 too paralyzed by the problems surrounding deregulation to respond to an obv=
ious impending shortage of power. "A lot of executives had their heads in th=
e sand," he says.=20
Duke is still expansion-minded, with a number of new power plants on its boo=
ks. Priory seems reassured by the growing contributions of wholesale electri=
c power and gas to the company's earnings stream; wholesaling drove second-q=
uarter earnings up 23%, and contributed to a 43% gain in revenue in the year=
's first half. The company expects to earn $1.9 billion, or $2.50 a share, f=
or the year, compared with $2.10 a share in 2000.=20
Still, Priory is keeping an eye on industry supply, and says Duke could curt=
ail construction if necessary. "Over the next three-to-five years we're like=
ly to see an easing of currently tight markets, and that could mean some new=
 plants that have been announced don't get built," he says. The company canc=
eled orders for two small "peaker" plants earlier this year, but still plans=
 to add around 20,000 megawatts of capacity by the end of 2002.=20
In recent years the utility industry has been partially reconfigured by seve=
ral big mergers, and further consolidations might radically alter the outloo=
k for power supply and demand. It is hard to handicap the prospects for more=
 deals, however, because proposed mergers often risk substantial regulatory =
and other delays.=20
The electric industry has mounted a protracted effort to obtain Congressiona=
l repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, a relic of the Great Dep=
ression that was designed to halt consolidation. Utility executives have spe=
culated that outright repeal would unleash a tidal wave of mergers among the=
 roughly four-score publicly traded firms. That, in turn, conceivably would =
lead to plant consolidations and diminished need for additional plant capaci=
ty. Completed and pending mergers between electric power producers and natur=
al-gas pipeline companies also might mitigate the need for some new power pl=
ants. In the long term, the development of alternative energy sources, such =
as solar- and wind-based power, also could curb construction of coal- and ga=
s-fired electric power plants.=20
The supply of natural gas in itself might alter the utility industry's futur=
e building plans. Many independent oil and gas producers stepped up drilling=
 last year as energy prices rose. But Christopher R. Ellinghaus, energy anal=
yst with Williams Capital Group, a New York investment bank, recently predic=
ted a third of the new power plants planned in the U.S. won't be completed b=
ecause of a shortage of gas. Ellinghaus thinks contraints on the supply of e=
lectric power will be eased for the next few years, but anticipates a much t=
ighter market thereafter unless an "unprecedented" amount of new gas is prod=
uced in three-to-five years.=20
The Bush Administration, which took office in the midst of California's ener=
gy crisis, isn't banking entirely on gas-fired plants, but pushing for the e=
xpanded use of coal and nuclear power. In recent years, however, it has been=
 tough to obtain regulatory approval for new coal-powered plants, despite mu=
ch progress in developing so-called cleaner coal. Industry groups have been =
pressuring the White House to lower environmental standards in order to spee=
d coal-mine development, and coal executives now seem jubilant about the pro=
spects for success. The industry notes that coal-fired plants generating mor=
e than 20,000 megawatts of power are now in the planning or development stag=
es.=20
Similarly, the nuclear power industry is flexing its muscles again, thanks i=
n part to encouraging words from President Bush. Nuclear plants, which now s=
upply 20% of the nation's electric power, fell into disrepute after accident=
s at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, and Chernobyl, in Russia. But the op=
erating records of most of the 104 nuclear plants in the U.S. since have imp=
roved, and the industry is determined to speed up the license renewal proces=
s. Building a new nuclear plantwould take several years, but some in the ind=
ustry are looking to newly-designed models that require shorter lead times.=20
In the meantime, plans continue apace for the industry's build-out of more g=
as- and coal-fired plants. But unless demand for power increases at a simila=
r clip, their output will go begging. Company earnings will suffer, and inve=
stors will find little reason to fall in love with utilities all over again.

Software companies face uphill battle in bid to shift from one-time sales fe=
es to monthly subscriptions

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Oracle Corp. built an $11 billion dollar a year busines=
s selling and installing software on computers, but CEO Larry Ellison thinks=
 those days are ending. Five years from now, Ellison believes Oracle will ge=
nerate most of its revenue renting its products in a world wired to the Inte=
rnet.=20
Under this scenario, businesses and eventually consumers will go online to l=
og on to a Web site and pay a monthly fee for access to a wide variety of ap=
plications, instead of buying a disk and installing the software on a single=
 computer's hard drive.
The transition is a no-brainer in Ellison's mind because businesses will sav=
e money hiring consultants to handle the tedious process of installing softw=
are on in-house computers and their employees will have the flexibility to a=
ccess applications from just about anywhere, using laptops and handheld devi=
ces.=20
Meanwhile, Redwood Shores-based Oracle will build a more reliable revenue st=
ream akin to a cash-rich cable TV company that collects subscriptions from a=
 captive audience month after month.=20
"I believe all software companies will transform themselves into online serv=
ice companies. We have no choice," Ellison said earlier this summer.=20
Even longtime Ellison nemesis, Microsoft Corp., is heading down the same pat=
h as Oracle. As part of a new Internet initiative unveiled last year, the Re=
dmond, Wash.-based company is introducing a new service called "HailStorm," =
which will enable businesses and consumers to rent a variety of online appli=
cations for a monthly fee.=20
Despite the resolve of the world's two biggest software companies, online so=
ftware rentals seem like a pipe dream to many industry executives and analys=
ts.=20
"Large companies are never going to trust someone else to run their software=
=2E If you believe technology is your most precious asset, you are not going=
 to let go of it," said PeopleSoft Inc. CEO Craig Conway. "Every year, it se=
ems like there is some major paradigm shift predicted for the industry. Some=
times they actually happen, but most of the time they don't."=20
Ellison certainly missed the mark with one of his most heralded predictions =
of sweeping technological change. In the mid-1990s, Ellison made worldwide h=
eadlines by unveiling a network company that would draw upon online resource=
s and make Microsoft's Windows-based operating system obsolete. Ellison's vi=
sion hasn't panned out yet and most analysts believe he is shooting too high=
 again with his ambitious predictions for online software services.=20
"It's going to be a very gradual evolution, if it occurs at all," said indus=
try analyst Charles Phillips of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "Peo=
ple like to have control over their own technology. They like to build it th=
emselves. They want to be able to see it in a room."=20
Security concerns and worries about system outages also might discourage onl=
ine software subscriptions.=20
Software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are pushing to build online sub=
scription businesses because they are beginning to recognize the growth limi=
tations of their traditional sales approach, Phillips said. Both companies a=
re reaching such a saturation point with their software that they realize th=
ere is only so much more money they can make from one-time fees for new prod=
ucts and upgrades.=20
A breed of companies known as "application service providers" have been stru=
ggling terribly in their efforts to rent software online. The most prominent=
 pure ASPs include Annapolis, Md.-based USinternetworking Inc. and San Mateo=
-based Corio Inc., which have lost $408 million and $186 million, respective=
ly since their inceptions in 1998 while attracting fewer than 500 customers =
combined.=20
Reflecting their grim outlook, the stocks of both companies are stuck under =
$1 per share. USinternetworking went public in April 1999 at $21 per share w=
hile Corio made its stock market debut in July 2000 at $14 per share.=20
Despite the early troubles of pioneering ASPs, the research firm Internation=
al Data Corp. sees a bright future for the concept. In a recent report, IDC =
predicted total ASP revenues will swell from $986 million last year to $24 b=
illion in 2005.=20
Proponents of online software rentals say the ASPs have flopped because they=
 are leasing applications made by outsiders, such as PeopleSoft, SAP and Sie=
bel Systems.=20
"The only companies that will be successful in delivering online services wi=
ll be the software companies themselves," Ellison predicts. "Everyone else t=
hat tries to deliver online services will fail."=20
Marc Benioff, one of Ellison's former lieutenants at Oracle, says his San Fr=
ancisco-based start-up is proof that online software subscriptions are the w=
ave of the future. Since going online in March 2000, Salesforce.com has sign=
ed up 50,000 employees at 2,800 companies that pay $65 per monthly subscribe=
r.=20
"We are going great guns," Benioff said. "The Internet has matured to the po=
int that it is more than capable of handling this kind of model."=20
Backed by $65 million in venture capital, privately held Salesforce.com is p=
rojecting revenues of $25 million this year, nearly quadrupling last year's =
sales of $7 million. The company expects to become profitable early next yea=
r when its revenues are expected to hit $60 million.=20
Analysts say Salesforce has proven that online subscription software works f=
or certain people, like on-the-go sales representatives, and for small- and =
medium-sized companies that might not have the budget, or time, to install c=
omplex software applications. The skeptics doubt large corporations will dep=
end on cookie-cutter online subscription services for complex applications c=
ritical to their day-to-day applications.=20
"This is fine for the small guys that don't want to be bothered with technol=
ogy, but the big companies want to be masters of their own destiny," said in=
dustry analyst Joe Outlaw of the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.=20
After using Salesforce's service for four months, energy giant Enron Corp.'s=
 director of sales, John Hillman, is convinced online subscription is the wa=
y to go for software applications. "I think you are going to see a whole reb=
irth in the ASP model," Hillman said. "It just makes too much sense for it n=
ot to work."=20
