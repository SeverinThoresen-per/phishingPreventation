Dona,

I too was just thinking last night how nice it was to see you both days this=
 past weekend--it felt like old times.
Once again Suggie and I want to thank you for letting us join you and the gi=
rls for the walk in the park.  Suggie really enjoyed herself and I am gratef=
ul that you all were so patient & kind to her.   She is really social and ju=
st loved being with the girls.

I am looking forward to Lilly's visit--so just let me know where to meet you=
 all on Friday.

Thank David for his offer to run the Bear--we will certainly take him up on =
it.

Take care.

Susan & Bear

I loved seeing you so much this weekend.  It makes me wonder how I lived
without you.  I am glad that things at work have calmed down and you can
get out more.  I can't wait to see Lilly this Friday night.  I love your
BEAR!  I told David all about her and he said that he would love to run her
while we walk. Have a great day!
