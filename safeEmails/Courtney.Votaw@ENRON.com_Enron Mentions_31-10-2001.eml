Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP has commenced a class action lawsu=

("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE: ENE) between on or about June 1, 1999, and=
 October 26, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period") against defendants Enron, =
Kenneth L. Lay (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer), Jeffrey =

 Class Definition does not include purchasers of Enron convertible stock.=20
The case name and index number are Steiner v. Enron Corp., et al., H 01-CV-3=
717, pending in Houston, Texas. The case is before Judge David Hittner.=20
The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of t=
he Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, b=
y issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period=
 that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of the Compa=

sued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and o=
perations which failed to disclose among other things that: (1) on or about =
June 1, 1999, the Company began entering into a series of extraordinarily le=
veraged investment and hedging transactions with a group of limited partners=

 or that these transactions could lead to billions of dollars in borrowings =
and writedowns of shareholders' equity, which would jeopardize the value of =
Enron's Preferred Securities; (2) Enron was failure to write-down impaired a=
ssets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP; and (3) the Company's opera=
ting results were materially overstated as a result of the Company's failing=
 to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited part=
nerships, including those described above. On October 16, 2001, Enron surpri=
sed the market by announcing that in the third quarter of 2001, the Company =
was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after tax ($1.11 per dilut=
ed share). Enron failed to clearly disclose until October 18 that it also wa=
s taking a $1.2 billion writedown in shareholders' equity as a result of unw=

Enron Shares Fall a Day After Moody's Lowers Rating (Correct)

Enron Shares Fall a Day After Moody's Lowers Rating (Correct)

     (Corrects today's low price in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares fell 19
percent after touching the lowest level in more than nine years, a
day after Moody's Investors Service placed the largest energy
trader's rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade and
lowered its long-term debt to two notches above junk status.

     Shares of Enron dropped $2.65 to $11.16. Earlier, the stock
fell to $10.90, the lowest since July 1992. The stock, down for
the 10th day in a row, has tumbled 87 percent this year.

     Moody's lowered Enron's long-term credit rating to ``Baa2''
from ``Baa1'' yesterday. It also placed the company's ``P-2''
rating for commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     ``I think investors would have loved to have no downgrade or
a more stable outlook for the company,'' Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade said. ``Moody's left some uncertainty.''

     Meade doesn't own Enron shares and rates the company
``accumulate.''

     Executives from Exelon Corp., American Electric Power Co. and
Northeast Utilities said they still are trading with Enron.

                        `Watching Closely'

     ``Nervous is probably not the right word, but we are watching
very closely,'' AEP Chief Executive Officer Linn Draper said at an
energy conference in New Orleans. ``We are focusing our new deals
with them in the short term, November and December,''

     Columbus, Ohio-based AEP is the biggest U.S. electricity
generator. Traders often buy and sell power for delivery the next
day or for over a week, month, quarter or calendar year. The
Bloomberg Energy Service is quoting power prices for as far ahead
as September 2003.

     ``We are keeping a close eye on our exposure,'' Exelon Corp.
Co-Chief Executive Officer John Rowe said at the conference. ``We
are keeping a tight dollar limit on trades.'' He declined to
provide specifics.

     Chicago-based Exelon is the biggest U.S. nuclear-power
producer.

     ``Three weeks ago, we started monitoring our position with
Enron,'' Northeast Chief Financial Officer John Forsgren said at
the conference. ``Right now, we have a net payable to them, so
there's no exposure on our side, and we'll probably keep it that
way.''

     Northeast, based in Berlin, Connecticut, will continue to
trade with Enron as long as its debt ratings remain investment
grade, Forsgren said. Northeast is New England's biggest utility
owner.

                            SEC Inquiry

     The Wall Street Journal reported that a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with
affiliates, run by the company's former chief financial officer
Andrew Fastow, has moved to Washington, signaling the
investigation has become more serious.

      Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from the affiliates, which were formed to buy and sell
Enron assets. Houston-based Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday amid
the SEC inquiry into the partnerships he ran that cost the company
at least $35 million.

     Other energy stocks also fell today as the price of natural
gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped as much as 3.7
percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index as much as 2.3 percent as
consumer confidence in the U.S. economy dropped in October to the
lowest level in more than 7 1/2 years.

     Shares of Duke Energy Corp. fell $1.43 to $37.71. Dynegy Inc.
dropped $2.63, or 6.8 percent, to $36.30. El Paso Corp. fell
$1.54, or 3 percent, to $49.20. Exxon Mobil Corp. fell $1.22, or 3
percent, to $39.46.



EPDC to Spend $500 Mln Abroad as Japan Deregulates Power Market
2001-10-30 16:46 (New York)

EPDC to Spend $500 Mln Abroad as Japan Deregulates Power Market

     Tokyo, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Electric Power Development Co.,
set up 49 years ago by Japan to power industrial growth, plans to
spend $500 million on utility stakes from Thailand to the U.S. to
help its first share sale as competition increases at home.

     EPDC, two-thirds owned by the finance ministry and the rest
by Japan's nine regional power companies, wants to add almost
2,000 megawatts capacity with stakes in power plants in the
Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, China and the U.S., to supplement
investments in Thailand and India, said Masahide Takaraya, deputy
director general of the company's international division.

     With Japan facing its worst recession in a decade, and the
government ending regional power monopolies in the country's $122
billion electricity market, EPDC, Tokyo Electric Power Co. and
rivals are looking overseas to expand.

     ``So far, their foreign investments are not big enough to
offset the domestic downturn. If they want to improve their
profit, (overseas acquisitions) have to get a lot bigger,'' said
Yoshihiko Ito. He has no power stocks among the $1.5 billion he
helps manage for Asahi Life Investment Co. because ``they're
constantly under the threat of deregulation and have no pricing
power.''

     In March 2000, Japan began deregulation by allowing 30
percent of the biggest power users to buy electricity from any
supplier, ending decades of monopoly by ten regional generators.
Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said it may generate and
supply electricity in Japan in one or two years if the market
opens.

     Meanwhile, Japan's economy will probably shrink this fiscal
year and next, the Bank of Japan said.

                           Asian Influx

     ``All Japanese power companies are looking abroad because the
Japanese economy is worsening,'' said Masahiro Oonishi, head of
EPDC's planning and administration department. ``Nowadays the
international department is trying to find big businesses in
Asia.''

     Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, in 1999 bought a tenth of
Baltimore, Maryland-based Orion Power Holdings Inc. for $80
million, a stake it has since sold to Reliant Energy Inc. Japan's
largest power company now has investments in Taiwan and Vietnam.

     ``We're seeking alternative profit sources outside of Japan
following deregulation in the local electricity industry,'' said
Takashi Nakayama, a Tepco spokesman.

     EDPC began its overseas campaign even earlier, in 1997, with
a 50 megawatt geothermal project in the Philippines. Last year, it
bought 11 percent of BPL Group's 520 megawatt power project at
Ramagundam in south India. It now owns minority stakes in power
projects in the Philippines, China and Thailand.

     Still, the expansion in Asia may have more to do with
troubles in Japan than the attractiveness of overseas investment,
said Hiroyuki Sakaida, an analyst at BNP Paribas Securities Japan
Ltd.

                           No Confidence

     ``They have no confidence they can get higher returns
abroad,'' said Sakaida. ``They're forced to seek business because
of sharper competition at home.''

     Japanese utilities make an average 5 percent return on their
domestic assets. Even if Asian acquisitions give a higher return,
that may be offset by political and currency risks, Sakaida said.

     Rivals' failed investments underline the point. Enron Corp.
is trying to sell its 65 percent stake in Indian generator Dabhol
Power Co., which is mired in a nine-month-old payment dispute with
its sole customer, Maharashtra State. Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional
Bhd., has labeled its Pakistan investment `Liability Power'
because the unit, Liberty Power Ltd., has lost $132 million.

     Japanese power companies ``need to avoid country risks abroad
where they have little experience,'' Sakaida said. ``Thailand is a
good choice because it has a relatively small country risk.''

     Almost half of EPDC's $100 million overseas investments to
date are in Thailand, including a half share of Gulf Electric Pcl,
60 percent-owner of a 734-megawatt coal-fired power project; and
19 percent of a 700 megawatt plant run by Thai Oil Power Co. EPDC
is also building in Thailand its first biomass plant outside
Japan, which uses agricultural waste as fuel.

                       Favorite Destination

     ``Thailand is our favorite destination because we believe
political risk there is almost zero,'' said EPDC's Takaraya.

     ``Still, it's a little bit dangerous to concentrate our
portfolio in one country.'' The next acquisition may be a stake in
a gas-fired power plant in the Philippines, he said.

     EPDC's overseas campaign demonstrates Japan's change in
policy. The company was set up in 1952 to build hydro and coal-
fired power stations to reduce dependence on oil-fired power and
help meet increasing demand from industrial growth. Its 58
hydropower plants and eight thermal stations are able to generate
as much as 16,015 megawatts, or 6.4 percent of the country's
capacity.

     EPDC's sales for the year ended March rose 10 percent to $4.1
billion, while gross profit rose 7 percent to $292 million.
     In June 1997, Japan's cabinet decided to privatize the
company within five years as part of the proposed deregulation.
The sale, now expected in 2003, would help cut the company's debt,
which totaled 2.1 trillion yen ($17 billion), or 30 times its
capital, in March.

     Japan's power producers, able to sell bonds paying as little
as 0.5 percent, are some of Asia's biggest borrowers. Tepco owed
7.76 trillion yen in long term debt in March.

     EPDC says it's aware of the political risks in investing in
Asia and chooses markets carefully.

     ``It's not the time to go to Indonesia,'' Takaraya said.



Enron Default Insurance Signals Eroding Confidence (Update5)

Enron Default Insurance Signals Eroding Confidence (Update5)

     (Adds background in 10th paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The price that investors pay
to protect against a bond default by Enron Corp. doubled this
week, reflecting on erosion of confidence in the biggest energy
trader. The shares plunged for a 10th day.

     To hedge against losses for the next 18 months, investors now
have to pay as much as 16.5 percent of the face value of bonds
they own. A week ago, such insurance cost 7.5 percent,  according
to CreditSights Inc.

      Enron ``made a lot of people nervous and the concern is the
nervousness will seep into Enron's operating business,'' said
Austin Ramzy, director of fixed income research at Principal
Capital Income Investors in Des Moines, Iowa, which owns about
$190 million in Enron bonds. ``The question of the day is whether
the crisis of confidence can be stopped.''

      The increase in the price of so-called default swaps is
another reflection, along with a 65 percent decline in Enron
shares in the past two weeks, that investors are losing confidence
in the company, analysts said.

     Enron shares, down 19 percent today to $11.16, have fallen
every day since the company surprised investors by writing off
$1.2 billion of assets on Oct. 17.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon bonds due in 2006 were bid at 73
cents on the dollar, traders said, down as much as 7 cents from
yesterday's price of 80 cents. The debt now yields 14.5 percent,
up from 12.1percent yesterday and 10.8 percent on Friday.

                             Exposure

     ``Banks wanting to hedge risk are pushing the price higher,''
said Andy Palmer, who doesn't own Enron bonds in the $1.25 billion
he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc.

     Enron default protection has risen from less than 3 percent
per year, a price that is common for similarly rated companies.
Other energy traders' such as Williams Cos. Inc. and Dynegy Inc.
both have default insurance premiums below 2 percent per year,
traders said.

     The increase in Enron's credit default swaps ``may be
overstating the default risk,'' said Palmer. The purchasers of the
default swaps are mainly banks that have loan exposure to Enron
and ``banks are not as price-sensitive as institutional
investors,'' said Palmer. ``They just want to get the exposure off
their books.''

     Principal Capital, which is an institutional investor, said
did not buy protection for its $190 million of Enron bonds.

     John Tompkins, a trader at CreditTrade, a credit derivatives
brokerage, said there's interest among buyers, though not sellers
of Enron default swaps. He said there are bids for Enron credit
default swaps at 7 to 8 percent annually for five years'
protection and 12 percent annually on the three years' contract --
with no offers.

     Enron Credit was one of the world's biggest non-bank traders
of default insurance.

                            Undisclosed

     The largest energy trader's troubles began two weeks ago when
it reported $1.01 billion in losses, including more than $544
million written off on a competitive energy supplier business and
a bandwidth trading business.

     Enron formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and sell
company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary of
state. Some of those affiliates profited after Enron used $1.2
billion of company stock to buy back assets from the partnership.

     The Houston-based company losses included $35 million from
partnerships set up by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
Fastow was later fired as chief financial officer and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about
the transactions.

     The disclosure has set off concern among investors about how
little is known about Enron's balance sheet and caused ratings
companies to examine the company.

     ``Investors are nervous about this name,'' said Freda Lam, a
fixed-income analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in New York.

                        Investor Relations

     Enron's long-term debt rating was cut yesterday to ``Baa2,''
two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' Moody's also placed the
Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper --
borrowing for nine-months or less -- on review for downgrade.
Enron has been shut off from the commercial paper market since the
ratings agencies began the review.

     The lack of access to money markets makes it more difficult
for Enron to borrow the short-term cash needed to run its trading
businesses. Ahead of a potential cut, Enron took out bank lines to
repay $2 billion in commercial paper last week.

     Still, many on Wall Street expects Enron's bonds to be paid
and its stock price to bounce back.

     ``We suspect that Enron's share price will not likely recover
in the near term,'' Lam said. ``We ultimately expect this company
to be successful. But it needs to improve its investor relations
and its disclosure.''

Enron chairman weathers a storm: Many in Houston believe Lay can get
firm back on track (BUSINESS)

  HOUSTON - Over the last 15 years, Enron Corp. has transformed itself
from a sleepy gas pipeline company into an energy trading giant.

  Chairman Ken Lay has changed along with it, from mere titan of
business to Houston's leading citizen.


  So when business reversals hit Enron and Mr. Lay, the ripples are felt
throughout civic life in a city where he has held virtually every
leadership position and the corporate name graces the baseball stadium.

  Two months after his heir apparent resigned, Mr. Lay has seen his
company buffeted by investors and has had to oust his chief financial
officer.

  The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into deals in which
the former CFO played dual roles with Enron and a hedge group.

  "My sense is it's probably a little too soon to tell what the impact
is with Ken himself," said Bob Eury, president of Central Houston Inc.,
a downtown development group.

  A loss of his and Enron's leadership "would be profound," Mr. Eury
added, but most Houstonians expect Mr. Lay to weather the company's
difficulties and continue his "marvelous leadership out in the
community."

  Still, no one is going to be surprised if Mr. Lay is preoccupied for a
while.

  "If the ship's on fire, you address that first," said oilman George
Strake, who has worked with Mr. Lay on civic projects.

  Mr. Lay, 58, returned to the chief executive's role in August when his
protege, Jeffrey K. Skilling, quit as CEO and president after only six
months on the job. And Mr. Lay cited those burdens last week when he
resigned as a director for i2 Technologies, the software developer based
in Farmers Branch.

  "This is a very painful decision," Mr. Lay said in a prepared
statement. "But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities
at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities."

  Enron's fall has been hard.

  From a 52-week peak of $84.62 on Dec. 28, the stock has been tumbling
for months. It skidded all the way to $15.40 as of Friday's close, about
half its value just two weeks earlier.

  Profits remain strong, but the company has announced write-downs of
key assets - totaling $1.01 billion in after-tax nonrecurring expenses -
and Wall Street analysts have turned coldly skeptical, if not hostile.

  Mounting troubles

  Enron confirmed the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
deals involving the just-departed CFO, Andrew Fastow. Under pressure,
Enron replaced him Wednesday.

  There have been other troubles, too. As lead advocate for electricity
market restructuring, Enron found itself under furious attack during
California's energy crisis last spring. Investments in communications
and water businesses soured. A huge power plant project in India has
become a problem.

  Mr. Lay has said all the concern is misplaced.

  "To say the least, we are ... disappointed with our stock price," he
told investors last week. But "our businesses are performing very well,
and we're continuing to conduct business as usual."

  As for the SEC's interest, "We welcome ... the opportunity it provides
us to put these matters to rest," he said.

  Skepticism that Mr. Lay can pull Enron back into the middle of the
road exists in Houston.

  But the doubters don't want to be quoted by name and are not
necessarily betting against him, considering his past successes.

  In Houston, "nobody's dancing on his grave," said lawyer David Berg,
who's active in civic and political affairs. "There's a lot of residual
respect for Ken Lay, and it's not going to go away even if he goes
bankrupt, but that isn't going to happen."

  Wall Street reaction

  Financier Charles Miller, a Wall Street veteran, said analysts appear
to be ganging up on Enron, with a few making "indefensible" comments
that might be criminal if made about a bank.

  "Wall Street may be envious of the fact that, from the trading
standpoint, he may have made one of the most profitable trading
operations in the history of the world and, from all I can tell, very
soundly," Mr. Miller said.

  From Wall Street comes a different interpretation: After the exit of
two top executives in two months, the company's other problems, and the
SEC's inquiry, it's time for more information from the company.

  "They've breached the confidence level with one thing after another,"
said John Parry, analyst with John S. Herold Inc.

  The 1980s oil, banking, and real estate busts have colored Houston's
attitude toward business reversals, some say.

  Having seen fortunes rise, fall, and rise again in the '90s, Houston
is less likely to lose leaders to temporary setbacks, energy banker
Matthew Simmons said.

  "Most cities, if you're new or if you're struggling, you're shut out,"
Mr. Simmons said. Not Houston, and "I think that's its genius."

  Real estate investor Ned Holmes recalled that when Exxon Corp.
suffered through the 1989 Alaska oil spill, the Chamber of Commerce
threw a reception to express support and appreciation for the company's
civic contributions.

  "We all turned out and told them that ... we know this is a difficult
deal, but they're an important part of this community and we're not
turning our back on them," Mr. Holmes said. "People feel every bit as
strongly, if not more so, about Ken."

  It's hard to overstate the importance of Mr. Lay and Enron in Houston.

  He chaired or co-chaired committees leading Houston in playing host to
the G-7 Summit in 1990 and the Republican National Convention in 1992.
He chaired the University of Houston board of regents.

  When plans for a new baseball stadium hit a snag in the mid-1990s, he
assembled a group of investors to buy the land and facilitate a deal
that led to voter approval. Enron then bought the naming rights to the
Astros' new home, Enron Field.

  Mr. Lay helped lead efforts to win voter approval of a new basketball
arena, now under construction. He has backed rail transit and other
measures to clean Houston's air.

  He and his wife, Linda, have been active in charities and have
supported political candidates.

  New model

  In reinventing itself into a $100 billion-a-year energy trader, Enron
created a business model that other energy companies have followed,
making Houston a leader in a new kind of commodities market.

  Enron, whose influence extends into the White House of President Bush,
is in the midst of adding to Houston's skyline, building a 40-story
building next door to the 50-story building it already occupies.

  Losing Mr. Lay's and Enron's leadership "would be a sizable blow,"
said Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, a
business-boosting group that includes the Chamber of Commerce. But "he
hasn't pulled back."

  "He has to be there to answer these questions. He's going to take time
to do that," Mr. Kollaer said. "But he's still functioning in a civic
regard."
