Kam,

I've been trying to clean up variances with Canada, and this is one of them.=
  The variance is really from September when these deals should have liquida=
ted, but didn't.  The variance has been sitting in our Canada profit center,=
 and I just moved it over to Management West in November (that's why the PMA=
 log says Nov).  Please take another look at these deals.  I do think the va=
riance is correct.  Please let me know if you agree.  I apologize for the da=
te confusion.

Thanks,
Amanda

Amanda,

Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are b=
ooked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's,=
 it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.

Thanks

Kam
