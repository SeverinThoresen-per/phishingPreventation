Vince-

Something very interesting about natural gas storage (from the class).

The industry is rapidly adopting what are called "Operational Balancing=20
Agreements," where the pipeline contracts with the producers and LDC's=20
(public utilities) to handle all "imbalances" in shipping, namely all=20
production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise.  Shippers then=20
always "book" what is scheduled to happen, and not what actually happens. =20
The end result is that storage facillities associated with production region=
s=20
are used to smooth out not only weekday-weekend seasonal patterns (the=20
well-known "parking") but to insure issues of wellhead output as well.=20
Cutting to the chase, storage facilities in producing regions are operated t=
o=20
insure the integrity of the pipeline system, and estimated marketed=20
production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline'=
s=20
receipt meter than is production less local storage.
