All testing was completed.  We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center=
 that the Exchange servers are up.  However, the Flow Gas testing was unsucc=
essful.  We logged into the system successfully, but received an error messa=
ge when selecting the NNG Invoice.  We paged the NNG Accounting On-call page=
r.  We will forward updates as they are received.
