Frank,

I have two questions for you.   First, I know you and I have had very little=
 profession interaction, but I would like to ask for a letter of recommendat=
ion from you.  I have asked Mike, but as of now I've had no response.  I ass=
ume he is very busy.  I know Patti will put one together, but Steve South is=
 truly the only other senior level trader I can ask, and I haven't seen him =
for a few days.  If you are not comfortable with this, I'd understand.  Howe=
ver, I would really appreciate it.

Finally, I am getting a few cold calls, and hearing of jobs within other org=
anizations.  If you are available, I would like to bounce a few of the compa=
nies I hear from off you?  I know I won't find another Enron, but I don't wa=
nt to work for company that is not well respected among the top traders.  Fo=
r example, I've had interest from/with; Aquilla, Dominion Resources, Amerada=
 HES, Goldman Sachs, Duke and Reliant.

I appreciate any assistance you can offer.

Thank you

Daniel D. Lisk
