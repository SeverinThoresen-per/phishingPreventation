Dick Basford (formerly, a consultant for Enron on Florida matters) called me=
 with a recommendation that EPMI withdraw from FRCC membership before EPMI i=
s invoiced in February for $5750 (1/4 of annual dues of $23,000).  There is =
no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the F=
RCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying=
 the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in t=
rading in Florida.

UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiat=
ion fee.

Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter. =20

Thanks.  Christi  37007
