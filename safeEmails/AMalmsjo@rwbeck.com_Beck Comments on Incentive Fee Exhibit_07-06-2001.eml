Marvin,=20

The exhibit on the Incentive Fee Calculation I just received is essentially=20
the same as we have seen before, and I still have the same overall comment.?=
=20
Unless I have some misunderstanding, it seems to me that in a Back-to-Back=20
Transaction you could easily have a situation in which EPMI is making a=20
profit from a transaction on which the Cities are losing money.? The "Saving=
s=20
per hour" on which EPMI's profit sharing is based is only the difference=20
between the Market Price (what the purchaser agreed to pay) and the Cities'=20
Target Production Cost (incremental fuel cost and variable O&M).? The=20
"Savings per hour" ignores all of the other costs that the Cities may be=20
obligated to pay under a Back-to-Back Transaction such as transmission,=20
ancillary service, imbalance, congestion, etc. (see the definition of Costs=20
below).? For example, if the Target Production cost is $40/MWh, the Market=20
Price $43/MWh, and transmission is $4/MWh, the Cities would be paying EPMI a=
=20
profit sharing incentive fee of $1.20/MWh, while losing $2.20/MWh on the sal=
e=20
transaction.? As I have noted before, the "Savings" on a transaction should=20
be as follows:

Savings =3D Revenues from the Transaction - Production Cost (base on the Tar=
get=20
Production Cost and MWhs) - Costs associated with the Transaction incurred b=
y=20
EPMI or the Cities (where Costs include the items defined in Article 1 of th=
e=20
EMSA)

We will get back to you later with comments on the other documents. - - Al=20


Definition of Costs in the ESMA:=20

"Costs" means, when applicable to any Transaction, all costs, liabilities,=20
fees and expenses? incurred by EPMI (excluding EPMI's internal costs and=20
allocated overhead) in connection with the purchase, sale, replacement,=20
scheduling, transmission and delivery of Products and balancing services,=20
entered into between MDEA, EPMI, and third parties. Costs shall include but=20
shall not be limited to: (i) energy and fuel costs, (ii) transmission costs=20
and losses, (iii) congestion costs, (iv) scheduling fees, (v) penalties,=20
inadvertent energy flow charges, or imbalance charges that are exclusive of=20
MDEA's Ancillary Service charges (vi) taxes (other than income taxes); (vii)=
=20
fees, penalties, or charges imposed by the SPP, SERC, ISO or RTO, Federal=20
