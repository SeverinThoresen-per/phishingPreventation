Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock pr=
ice again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major en=
ergy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizi=
ng effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with =
annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion,=
 handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's trade=
d-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, =
its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the en=
ergy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions=
=2E
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch ana=
lyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOn=
line." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in whi=
ch the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business oper=
ations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistentl=
y said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-o=
ld head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be i=
ntended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with t=
he matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing =
concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited p=
artnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions =
with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly =
a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. =
Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of incre=
asing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts =
and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as =
the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrange=
ments clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continued d=
iscussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restorin=
g investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Chairma=
n and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He c=
ouldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasi=
ngly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market c=
lose and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p=
=2Em. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16=
=2E41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nea=
rly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active =
stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, p=
ossibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stoc=
k.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier t=
his year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, =
which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dyn=
egy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number=
 of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much di=
fferent than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured in=
vestment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could =
be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. How=
ever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as i=
t did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admission o=
f guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely =
because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial str=
ucture.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings.=
=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the st=
ock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard pe=
ople voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing cred=
it concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do bu=
siness with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to=
 further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a =
buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of s=
uch a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about =
its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other ent=
ities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not easy =
to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confi=
dence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose=
 involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny o=
f the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as=
 C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a s=
tatement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told invest=
ors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the =
highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also n=
amed his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets =
group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, whe=
re Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half sinc=
e Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion re=
duction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with p=
artnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings new=
s release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed=
, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-=
off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they =
later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with anal=
ysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the t=
ransactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fa=
stow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details o=
f the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's =
disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron s=
tock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not=
 lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity th=
at had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.=
C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to add=
ress.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from =
complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off =
its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in c=
ash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured in=
vestors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity =
to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were mo=
re than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, th=
e former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in busi=
ness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy=
 trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock =
price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's =
successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was =
the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. =
Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon =
moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pric=
e for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading,=
 they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol =
Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' f=
rom ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday.=
=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterd=
ay evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a=
 gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a li=
ttle late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People coul=
d fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get =
any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-bas=
ed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal sec=
urities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investment=
 partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andre=
w Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period and=
 named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The compan=
y said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done =
anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock mar=
ket closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons,=
 found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter=
 earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analys=
ts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron'=
s board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJ=
M2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, =
served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of E=
nron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also en=
ded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron=
 took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 bi=
llion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fol=
lowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected i=
n dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed betwe=
en Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before=
 moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the=
 company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon as=
ked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable w=
ith the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available fo=
r comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a=
 salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "i=
nformal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor c=
onfidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water =
and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skillin=
g in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed=
 the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various finan=
cial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give a=
nalysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partner=
ships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to is=
sue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities.=
=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current ou=
tstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may b=
e downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16=
, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other co=
mpanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which=
 closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some wa=
y end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with ana=
lysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston,=
 moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company a=
ttempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial=
 officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which ha=
s lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed t=
hat Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr La=
y defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partners=
hips that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns ther=
e may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 1=
6 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the cha=
rge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the par=
tnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to co=
nfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exch=
ange Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enr=
on's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier s=
erved as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. =
Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonst=
rating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for M=
r Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those call=
s.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading =
to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned about =
what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have =
to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced =
to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customer=
s to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove th=

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chief=

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America
2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)

was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William =

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inves=
tors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the com=
pany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange=
 Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern=
 or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of th=
e SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "Who =
knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after t=
he energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monda=
y's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did busin=

"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed We=
dnesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who=
 has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets gr=
oup, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equities=
 analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than =
replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming=
 in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few=
 days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim sai=
d.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transp=
arent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more transpa=
rent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 p=
er share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, =
Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygi=
n said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has acted=
 as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their appr=
oach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the p=
artnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflic=
t existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since =
been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or =
here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever e=
xpect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't have t=
o disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qua=
rter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive offi=
cer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future=
, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company bei=
ng able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from =
now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Fe=
ygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow b=
efore a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused Mc=
Mahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the =
partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no n=
eed for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was somet=
hing Enron needed to do."

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief =
financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferenc=
e call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial offi=
cer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by th=
e Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Je=
ff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The=
 stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of =
shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulti=
ng from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity =
for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a=
 partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of g=
rowing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently lookin=
g into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference=
 call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in th=
e partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit=
 filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by=
 allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol C=
oale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this w=
eek, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not because=
 of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know a=
bout the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dail=
y volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's =
line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chie=
f financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equi=
ty. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for details.=
=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad =
news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compan=
y's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term for=
tunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company=
's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's low=
ered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with A=
ndrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the ex=
ecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, sa=
ddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this deal, =
and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed,=
 falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that =
once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of on=
ce-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale=
, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fasto=
w is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, forme=
rly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's al=
leged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to s=
how that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous=
 sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained abo=
ut Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fasto=
w couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly maki=
ng a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron=
=2E An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took=
 massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a d=
ifficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing=
=2E It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other=
 words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much furth=
er does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the c=
ompany?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and =
Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was neces=
sary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shado=
wy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading busi=
ness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation=
 and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed th=
e LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadba=
nd business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from=
 being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge tha=
t volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to=
 increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the dow=
nside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds =
that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not tho=
ught it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. A=
rguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent o=
n potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has=
 risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhea=
lthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spoke=
swoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency=
=2E=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder=
 people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cre=

Small-Stock Focus: Russell 2000 Ekes Out Increase; Adtran, Arris Group Post =
Gains

NEW YORK -- It was a day for small-cap stocks to hug the baseline -- barely =
moving -- before ending the day with a slight gain as a number of positive p=
rofit reports pitched them onto positive ground.=20
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks rose 0.28 point, or 0.=
07%, to 427.65, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 27.10, or 1.59%, to 1=
731.54.
Given small caps' modest advance, their finishing the day higher hardly was =
guaranteed. For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues =
and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped =
into negative territory.=20
The day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and invest=
ors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not.=20
Generally for small caps, "It's `where do we go from here' time," said Andre=
w Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot =
of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market r=
eopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to=
 be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. "Now, it seems the whole market is l=
ooking for direction."=20
On the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing=
 and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628.=20
It was tech all the way among the day's top performers.=20
Communications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking fir=
ms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.9=
7, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 9=
3 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17.=20
Semiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small c=
aps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology=
 rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80.=20
Wireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Ne=
xtel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a th=
ird-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmnes=
s in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate=
 PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78.=20
The day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to =
be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedm=
ont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56=
 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06.=20
Pegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambr=
idge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stron=
ger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expecte=
d third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate =
by 10 cents a share.=20
Pinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., =
video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a =
share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share.=
 Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.'=20
Sybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-softwar=
e developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall=
 Street's expectations by two cents a share.=20
In a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offe=
ring 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was =
priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80.=20
Merger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3=
=2E38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker=
 signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $=
380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies=
' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share=
 held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80.=20
Vysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-diseas=
e researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share=
, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24.=20
ONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fi=
ber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus esti=
mate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss =
will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million =
to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, exc=
luding items, on revenue of $50.1 million. Credit Suisse First Boston cut sh=

WASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their per=
formance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research grou=
p The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday.=20
In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the countr=
y, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded =
grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmark=
s.
"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Director=
s have not had the scrutiny they deserve," said Ms. Minow, who said the serv=
ice will be called Board Analyst.=20
Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com=
, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next ye=
ar, she said.=20
Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. direc=
tors may be added later.=20
Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate g=
overnance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based=
 shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund m=
anagement group Hermes.=20
Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-=
side, said industry spokespersons.=20
"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in=
 general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there =
would be interest in more information on individual directors," said Ann Yer=
ger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represent=
s America's large pension funds.=20
The corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has fo=
cused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies h=
ave responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock =
ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound.=
=20
One example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days sin=
ce the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating=
 transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief=
 financial officer, Ms. Minow said.=20
"Where was the Enron board in all of this?" she asked. "Boards and outside c=
onsultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That appar=
ently didn't happen here."=20
Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued th=
at effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should=
 be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a =
company.=20
"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment an=
alysis," she said.=20
Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzin=
g stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an=
 open question.=20
"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have=
 moved corporate governance in a positive direction," said Peter Gleason, vi=
ce-president of research and development at the National Association of Corp=
orate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors.=20
Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank sel=
f-evaluation high on their list of concerns. "More and more directors are sa=
ying this is something we should be doing," Mr. Gleason said.

Enron replaces CFO Andy Fastow=20
Announcement comes on heels of vote of confidence=20
CBSMarketWatch.com
Lisa Sanders
10/24/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - One day after issuing a public vote of confidence in his=
 chief financial officer, Enron Chief Executive Ken Lay ousted him Wednesday=
 in the latest in a two-week series of events that have caused Enron shares =
to more than halve.
Enron named Jeff McMahon its new chief financial officer Wednesday, replacin=
g Andy Fastow. The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was an atte=
mpt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.
"Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and =
he's been unfairly pilloried in the press," said John Olson, an analyst at S=
anders Morris Harris in Houston. "But the weight of circumstantial evidence =
and the material stock price decline made this inevitable."
Olson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Str=
eet.
A rough week
Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about i=
ts accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships cr=
eated by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved.=20
Enron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recent=
ly chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 =
to 2000, would take over.
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," said Lay, in a statement.
Karen Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and=
 Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would =
return.=20
Shares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell fur=
ther in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one=
 point during the trading day, the shares were trading at a six-year low of =
$15.51.=20
Analysts deliver blows
Olson called Tuesday's conference call a "missed opportunity," saying Enron =
had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more =
"forthright and open."
"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawyers," said Olson, who has not re=
commended the stock until recently. "This company has been very much abused =
and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, =
and they have been carrying some losers." Enron has "an excellent growth pro=
file and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent =
surplus cash flow," Olson said.
Enron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 m=
illion devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, =
the company will have $1.5 billion free.
Several Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, inclu=
ding Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a ra=
re recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a "hold."=20
"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of thi=
ngs we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the compan=
y," wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note.=20
On Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limite=
d partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. S=
everal shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.
"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the iss=
ue at hand, the LJM transactions," Coale said in reference to the conference=
 call.=20
Olson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers, would allo=
w the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whether it was "rig=
ht," he conceded it was probably not.
J.P. Morgan's Anatol Feygin downgraded his rating to "long-term buy" from "b=
uy," saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more informat=
ion about its liabilities.=20
"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to disclose=
 the necessary information to assuage investor concerns," Feygin wrote.=20
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't able=
 to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on watch =
for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new equity=
 would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce earnings=
-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a share for 200=
1.=20
"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10 percent," Eas=
sey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call.=20
But Eassey believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 =
billion in 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to "insulate" th=
e company's credit ratings.

USA: UPDATE 1-Beleaguered Enron names new CFO.
By Jeff Franks

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , trying to halt a freefall in its s=
tock price and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street, named a new chief =
financial officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow, who has been linked=
 to transactions now under investigation by government regulators.=20
The company, which is the nation's largest energy trader, said Fastow would =
take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon, who has been runnin=
g an Enron unit and is the company's former treasurer, in a bid to restore c=
redibility with investors.
Fastow's departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Sk=
illing, who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after just six months on th=
e job.=20
Wednesday's change came after Enron's stock fell $3.38 to $16.41, its lowest=
 point in six years, to cap off a $13 billion plunge in market value since t=
he company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down sharehold=
er equity by $1.2 billion in a move related to the questionable transactions=
=2E=20
Wall Street's anxieties about Enron spread to the stocks of other natural ga=
s and power traders and marketers on Wednesday, with Dynegy Inc. falling 12.=
8 percent to $37.26 and Aquila Inc. off 11.7 percent at $21.20.=20
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the c=
ompany did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships =
run by Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now lo=
oking into for possible conflict of interest.=20
Wall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it of=
 not being forthcoming about the matter, a problem Enron chief executive Ken=
 Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear t=
o me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as =
CFO," he said in a statement.=20
McMahon, who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief executive=
 officer of Enron's Industrial Markets group, has a "deep and thorough under=
standing of Enron" and the confidence of the investment world, Lay said.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke up abou=
t the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangements made=
 by Fastow. The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which =
led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change.=20
Fastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to spe=
ak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuit=
s now pending against the company.=20
As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovato=
r with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed f=
rom a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new=
 Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities.=20
But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power =
plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Ski=
lling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation.=20
There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had =
become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility.=20
Analysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction fo=
r Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems.=20
"The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of under=
standing of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself d=
oesn't really address those concerns," said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards.=20
"I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilit=
ies Enron might have with these partnerships," he said. "I still have a lot =
of questions."=20
Andre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpe=
cted, but not that helpful.=20
"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the pictu=
re," he said. "Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it=
 comes to these transactions."=20
"The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can=
 it get?" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin.

USA: Utility stocks drop on slipping expectations.
By Jim Brumm

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Slipping expectations of 2002 power profits com=
bined with Enron Corp.'s growing problems helped drag utility stock prices t=
o their lowest levels this month on Wednesday.=20
While the general market closed higher, the S&P Utilities Index ended the da=
y with a loss of 8.99, or 3.55 percent, to 244.32.
The big loser, as it has been in many recent sessions, was Enron, which trad=
ed at the lowest price since February 1995 before steadying a bit to close a=
t $16.41 - down 17.08 percent, or $3.38, for the day and 44 percent from its=
 price two weeks ago - as analysts recommended selling the stock.=20
Prudential's Carol Coale said the sell recommendation was not made "because =
of things that we know, but because of things we potentially do not know.=20
After the close Enron said it named former treasurer Jeff McMahon to replace=
 Andrew Fastow as chief financial officer, and quoted chief executive office=
r Kenneth Lay as saying "it became clear to me that restoring investor confi=
dence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."=20
Close behind Enron on the biggest loser lists Wednesday were companies that =
had patterned themselves after the power trading giant. Closest was Dynegy I=
nc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its low=
est price in three weeks.=20
POWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED=20
The talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and tradi=
ng came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - Ameri=
can Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group=
 Inc. and PPL Corp. .=20
Early Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per=
 share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on pow=
er sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it s=
till sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share.=20
Noting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia S=
ecurities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to "market perfor=
m" from "strong buy" explaining PPL's "failure to differentiate itself from =
the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility.=20
"The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to=
 be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,=
" he concluded.=20
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exe=
lon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations.=20
STOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES=20
"The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity pri=
ce assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker dis=
tribution demand" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chica=
go, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday.=20
Exelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 200=
2 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the =
World Trade Center.=20
The company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the =
earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares conti=
nued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers =
among the 40 S&P Utility Index components.=20
The big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distr=
ibute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 perc=
ent.=20
Losses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down=
 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48.=20
AEP "management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (o=
f its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve," =
Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his esti=

Enron Officers Profited From Inside Knowledge, Lawsuit Alleges
2001-10-24 19:58 (New York)

Enron Officers Profited From Inside Knowledge, Lawsuit Alleges

     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives
profited from inside knowledge when they sold $73 million in
shares ahead of a 26 percent drop in the energy trading company's
stock in February and March, a shareholder alleges in a lawsuit.

     The allegations of insider trading were filed today as an
amendment to an earlier lawsuit filed by shareholder Fred
Greenberg.

     The original lawsuit, filed on Oct. 17 in Houston, accuses
Enron's board of costing the company at least $35 million through
dealings with two partnerships run by former Chief Financial
officer Andrew Fastow.

     In the amendment filed today, the suit accuses Fastow of
using insider knowledge that Enron's stock was going to drop to
prevent losses at one of the partnerships, LJM2.

     The partnership was committed to buying Enron stock at
predetermined price in September 2000, the complaint says. Enron
agreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy
the shares two months early.

    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the
suit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the
partnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in
September, the suit alleges.

                           `Bailed Out'

     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to
reap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars
in this transaction alone,'' the suit says.

     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being
renegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold
the $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.

     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge
insider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.

     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief
Strategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,
Chief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and
Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the
lawsuit.

     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our
policy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said

     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised
stock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.

     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and
sell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary
of state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in
third-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM
partnerships run by Fastow.

                            SEC Inquiry

     Greenberg says directors shouldn't have allowed Fastow to run
partnerships that bought and sold company assets.

     Shares of Enron have fallen 52 percent in the past six days
on investor concern about the liabilities attached to partnerships
and affiliated companies formed by Enron to remove debt from its
books. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into
the partnerships.

     Enron shares fell $3.38 to $16.41.

Enron Ousts Fastow, Names McMahon CFO Amid Inquiry (Update5)

Enron Ousts Fastow, Names McMahon CFO Amid Inquiry (Update5)

     (Adds description of Enron Net Works in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest
energy trader $35 million.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO because ``it became clear to me that restoring
investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.
Fastow will take a leave of absence.

     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have fallen 80 percent
this year. Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed
investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped
out 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.

     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to
Andy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded
Enron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.

     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron
President Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest
posed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the
Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.

     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and
objecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was
transferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''
which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.

                       `An Outstanding Job'

     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's
involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million
in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares
from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.

     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's
board of directors continue to have the highest faith and
confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as
CFO.''

      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock
closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.

      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.
Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron
is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.

     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships
and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as
power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office
indicate.

     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers
and directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have
any financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed
ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.

                        `Zero Compensation'

     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members
are representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero
compensation.''

     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed
Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them
and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,
the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a
shareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships
reworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.

     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two
other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise
enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when
asked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.

     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's
more with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''
said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a ``hold'' rating on
Enron and owns no shares.

                       High Level Departures

     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past two
years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the
job, citing personal reasons and frustration with declines in the
company's stock price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton
left the company in November as the company switched its focus
from developing assets to energy and commodity trading.

     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.
business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of
Azurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also
resigned from Enron's board.

     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in
the water company to the public that it later had to buy back.
