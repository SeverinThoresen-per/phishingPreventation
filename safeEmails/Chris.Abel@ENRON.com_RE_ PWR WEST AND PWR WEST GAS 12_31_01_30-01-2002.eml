The reason for the variaces is that you are adding up the daily P&L for 12/3=
, 12/4, and 12/31 and trying to reconciile with MTD P&L as of 12/31.  Howeve=
r, please note that we produced the 12/31 P&L (i.e. west pwrdpr1231) treatin=
g 12/31 as the only calc/trading day in Dec 01', meaning that you should no =
longer be looking at 12/3 and 12/4 P&L and counting them as part of the MTD =
P&L anymore.
=20
In short, our dpr for 12/31 should have the same Daily and MTD P&L.  Therefo=
re, the "output" column in the attached spreadsheet is wrong since it's addi=
ng up daily P&L for 12/3, 12/4, and 12/31.
=20
* I checked the east desk's P&L and believe we all did the same thing, i.e. =
treating 12/31 as the only trading/calc day in Dec.  You shall observe simil=
ar variances in the reconciliation for their dpr for 12/31 as well.
=20
Please let me know if you have further questions.

spreadsheets and let me know where we might be out.
