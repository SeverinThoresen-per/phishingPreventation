Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO=20
citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did=20
with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because=
=20
it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.

Comments, questions?

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trad=
e=20
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go=20
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr=
=20
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
 Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I=

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG=
=20
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient=20
