Michelle,

All efforts to try to get Mo to reduce his contract pay and end the separati=
on negotiations have been unsuccessful and on August 9th, he sent me an e-ma=
il stating that he has decided to continue his garden leave with full pay & =
benefits and will await "Enron's notification regarding termination accordin=
g to his employment terms."

We were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to p=
ay him, but it's this last statement about the notification of termination t=
hat concerns me.

I would have thought that our presentation of a separation agreement to him =
back in November would have been enough written "notification" that we do no=
t wish to continue his employment past the contract end date, but in speakin=
g with him further, he seems to think that its not. =20

His contract states that if the Company terminates your employment without 1=
2 months written notice, then the Company shall pay you the remainder of you=
r salary for the 12 months from the date it gave your notice, in a lump sum.=
 =20

His contract end date is 6/30/2002 and the last thing we want to do is to pa=
y him additional money.  Please let me know what your legal interpretation o=
f this notification clause is and whether or not we are required to give him=
 a formal termination notice.

Thanks
Cathy
