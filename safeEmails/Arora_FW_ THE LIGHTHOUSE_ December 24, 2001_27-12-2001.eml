DEFUNCT "STIMULUS" PACKAGE IS UNCLE SAM'S UNINTENDED GIFT

Uncle Sam sent taxpayers an unexpected gift last week: an economic=20
"stimulus" package that never made it off Capitol Hill.

Many economists, critical of the proposed government spending=20
increases, have pointed out that the economy had already started to=20
show signs of recovery anyway. Other critics correctly point out that=20
the "stimulus" had enough pork to keep special-interest groups=20
hibernating high on the hog till next winter.

There is, however, another reason to have frowned at Washington's=20
"stimulus" proposals and to rejoice at their demise. Government=20
"stimulus" packages are not, as environmentalists might say,=20
"sustainable." They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private=20
investment -- the fuel of economic recovery. And when a government=20
"stimulus" is financed by inflation, it tends to undermine the source=20
of that fuel: capital formation.

This holiday season we can thank Congress for its inability to agree=20
to "help" the economy. But, unfortunately, we're still haunted with=20
visions of Christmas past, when bad legislation has gone back to=20
conference committees only to be return as even worse legislation.

Too bad Washington, DC, doesn't have a "no returns" policy.

ODE TO JOHN ASHCROFT AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

So long as Americans have freedom of speech, there is hope that the=20
flame of liberty will remain lit. In that spirit, we offer the=20
following ditty posted on the website of The Nonviolence Web.

    "Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties"
    (Sung to the tune of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town")

    You better watch out,
    You better not pout,
    You better not cry.
    I'm telling you why.
    John ashcroft's coming to town.

    He sees you with your lawyer.
    He listens to every phone;
    He reads everyone's email,
    and he locks you all alone.

    With little tin guns
    And tiny cellphones
    Rooty hoot, hoot, he's breaking in homes,
    Big Brother is coming to town.

    He knows when you are traveling.
    He knows who you're around;
    Tried in military courtrooms,
    Not a lawyer can be found.

    He's makin' a list,
    and checking for race,
    Gonna arrest those who are dark of face.
    Big Brother's coming to town.

    You better watch out,
    You better not pout,
    You better not cry.
    I'm telling you why.
    Big Brother's coming to town.

A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION

Christmas, a holiday rooted in both Christianity and pre-Christian=20
celebrations of the winter solstice, is also an appropriate time to=20
reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization=20
over the course of two tumultuous millennia. Among these values:=20
freedom of conscience, peace on Earth, and goodwill toward men.

These values transcend any particular religion; they are in fact=20
articulated in varying degrees by most of the world's religions. Yet=20
they have found their fullest expression in the West. Why?

Because in Western culture more than in any other, the individual counts.

"This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western=20
civilization," writes Paul Craig Roberts.

And it is this individualist precept -- respect for the dignity and=20
worth of each human life -- that holds the key to understanding the=20
unique institutions of the West.

The West's individualism, writes Roberts, "permits an individual=20
person to put his or her foot down, to take a stand on principle, to=20
become a reformer and take on injustice.... It has made the=20
individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens, protected=20
from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech."

Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the=20
progressive forces of what one economist termed "creative=20
destruction," so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar=20
phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas. This perhaps is the West's=20
supreme paradox (and achievement) -- its tradition of questioning=20
even tradition itself.

Concludes Roberts: "Be we religious or be we not, our celebration of=20
Christ's birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our=20
souls and of our political life on Earth. Such a religion as this is=20
worth holding onto even by atheists."
