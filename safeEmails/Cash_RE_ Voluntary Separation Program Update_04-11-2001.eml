I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might=
 be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.

I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I be=
lieve that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their applica=
tion before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arise=
s, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.

I'll be glad to review and edit, and to prepare a separation agreement.  Mic=
helle, do you think we need to have NY counsel review the separation agreeme=
nt?

On the question of rescinding the agreements, I think that an employee who r=
escinds a separation agreement may not be entitled to anything because the p=
erson still has voluntarily quit and isn't entitled to any severance under a=
ny plan.  But for employees who try to rescind the application for voluntary=
 severance (ie say they don't want to quit at all), I think we've led them t=
o believe that they can do so without repercussion.  So, I would say that th=
ey remain employees who (1) ultimately still can choose to voluntarily quit,=
 or (2) may be selected for termination, in which case we may owe severance.=
  Michelle, do you agree? =20

Michelle, Lizzette,

We have extended our application deadline to 9AM Monday since many employees=
 have been asking for more consideration time.

I expect by Tues, Weds next week we will have determined which employees app=
lications will be accepted.  With this in mind, can I ask you to take a look=
 at the following acceptance and rejection letters?  These were used in Lond=
on's program, and will need to be edited for use in the US.

Additionally, can you send me a copy of the Separation and Release Agreement=
 to be used for the Voluntary Program?  I would like to familiarize the busi=
ness leads on what it will contain.  Can you please ensure that the Agreemen=
t contains verbiage reference payment subject to adequate performance (per t=
he Plan document).

We anticipate that the termination dates for the first wave of employees lea=
ving under the is Program would leave by 12/31/2001. This means that the lat=
est I can get the Agreement to them is Nov 15 so they will have the full 45 =
day consideration period.  With such a narrow timeline, I will try my best t=
o get you all the information for effected employees soon as possible so tha=
t you will have time to prepare the Agreements.

Also, what happens in the event that the employee rescinds the Separation & =
Release Agreement?  Do they then, by default, receive involuntary severance?

Thanks
Cathy
