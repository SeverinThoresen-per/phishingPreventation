I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My =
understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminate=
d, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as norma=
l" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the coun=
terparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we sp=
lit with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA=
 if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa
