Lynn, I was not sure when you were leaving town and I
got the invoice for Jewels.  Can you get me a check
tonight or this weekend?  Jewels was $260.
We'll also need the $500 for the filing fee.
I can also endorse the check from New Power.

Can we get this done some time this weekend?

Thanks,
Richard
