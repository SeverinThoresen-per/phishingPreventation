Dr. Lay,

I just wanted to write to apologize on behalf of whomever sent you those hos=
tile questions.  Even though we have some reasons to be angry, we do not hav=
e=20
an excuse to be rude or disrespectful, specially to you.  I wanted you to kn=
ow that those acts do not reflect the sentiments of the majority of Enron Em=
ployees. We are embarrassed that you even had to address the question on the=
 first place.  Please accept this apology and we hope to have you around for=
 a long time, your words of encouragement really makes a difference, thank y=
ou.

Best regards,

Adriana Wynn
