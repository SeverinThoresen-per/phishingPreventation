As you may be aware, SAP system response time was slow during earlier this w=
eek. As a result, SAP Financials, iBuyit, and iPayit applications were exper=
iencing longer than normal response times on most transactions. The Integrat=
ed Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root ca=
uses of this issue and has deployed a task force to address the following id=
entified areas:

Technical Issues (Infrastructure and Application related)
Internal Process Improvements (Both within the ISC and in the User Community=
)
Education of Business Users

We have made significant improvements in the last few days and as a result c=
urrently running within normal response time.  We will continue to provide w=
eekly status updates on our continued progress.
