A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her=
=20
first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and=
=20
begin eating a fine meal.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousnes=
s=20
and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water.=20
Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out=
=20
a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof.=20
Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looke=
d=20
over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a=20
rather stern voice, "Skippy!"

The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A=20
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time=
,=20
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The=20
father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"

Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman=
=20
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She le=
t=20
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit=20
Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!"
