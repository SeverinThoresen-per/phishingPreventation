Broadcom Reports First Quarter 2001 Results

IRVINE, Calif., Apr 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq=
:
BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband
communications, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarte=
r,
ended March 31, 2001.

Gross revenue for the first quarter was $318.1 million, an increase of 66%=20
over
the $191.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of 1=
6%
from the $378.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue=20
for
the first quarter was $310.5 million, an increase of 62% over the $191.6=20
million
reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of 9% from the $340.2
million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue includes the
non-cash revenue deduction of the fair value of assumed performance-based
warrants earned by certain customers.

Pro forma net income was $24.2 million, or $.09 per share (diluted). This
compares with pro forma net income of $44.9 million, or $.18 per share
(diluted), for the same quarter in 2000, and pro forma net income of $88.8
million, or $.32 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2000. Diluted
earnings per share for the quarter were based on 281.0 million weighted=20
average
shares outstanding, compared to 252.6 million weighted average shares
outstanding in the first quarter of 2000 and to 274.1 million weighted avera=
ge
shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Broadcom reports net income and diluted earnings per share on a pro forma=20
basis,
which excludes the effects of the non-cash revenue deduction related to
performance-based warrants, acquisition-related expenses, certain=20
non-recurring
settlement charges, and payroll taxes on certain stock option exercises.
Including these charges, substantially all of which were non-cash, net loss=20
for
the first quarter was $356.9 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with net
income of $38.6 million, or $.15 per share (diluted), in the same quarter of
2000, and with a net loss of $768.3 million, or $3.28 per share, in the four=
th
quarter of 2000.

During the quarter, Broadcom announced and closed its acquisition of=20
ServerWorks
Corporation, a leading supplier of high performance SystemI/O(TM) solutions=20
for
server and storage platforms, network appliances and workstations. Broadcom=20
also
completed the acquisition of Visiontech Ltd., a leading supplier of digital
video/audio MPEG-2 compression and decompression chips enabling Personal Vid=
eo
Recording (PVR) and IP video streaming for the consumer electronics market.
These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accountin=
g.

"Our first quarter results met the revised expectations that we communicated=
=20
on
March 6th. Looking ahead, as a result of the continued weakness in the
communications sector, we have not yet seen improvement in order visibility=20
from
customers," said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadcom's President and CEO.
"Despite the current weakness that exists in the business, we continue to be
confident that our product roadmaps in both the core and emerging markets wi=
ll
position us well as the economy recovers."

During the first quarter, Broadcom introduced several significant new=20
products.
The company announced the world's first 0.13 micron CMOS Gigabit Copper
Transceiver, a four channel device on a single monolithic chip. This product
enables cost-effective, high port count Gigabit Ethernet switches and router=
s=20
by
doubling port density and reducing size and power requirements by 50%. This
industry leading product marks the fourth generation of Gigabit transceiver
products from Broadcom.

Broadcom's new products for optical communications applications included the
world's first system-on-a-chip OC-48 line card, the world's first single-chi=
p
OC-192 CMOS transceiver, a low power and low cost OC-192 framer and the=20
world's
lowest power 10-Gigabit CMOS limiting amplifier. These product introductions
position Broadcom very well in the market for broadband optical=20
communications.

Broadcom's newly acquired ServerWorks business made two noteworthy=20
announcements
during the first quarter. First, ServerWorks unveiled its new Grand=20
Champion(TM)
architecture for future Intel(R) Xeon(TM) based servers. This product is the
first to support PCI-X, the new high performance input/output standard for
server and workstation platforms and the first to deliver memory bandwidth o=
f
6.4 Gbytes/second or four times the company's previous solutions. In additio=
n,
ServerWorks announced new SystemI/O logic that is optimized for dense Intern=
et
network servers produced by OEM customers such as Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC and
Siemens.

During the quarter, the Home Networking Business Unit extended its industry
leading position by surpassing the two million unit milestone for total numb=
er
of units shipped. HomePNA(TM), which utilizes the phone lines already in a=20
home,
continues to be the most widely produced home networking technology.

Broadcom also announced, sampled, gained design wins and has begun shipping=20
the
world's first single-chip IP phone solution incorporating Ethernet switch
technology, dual Ethernet transceivers, DSP and RISC processor cores and=20
analog
CODECs for handset and speakerphone support. This highly integrated Ethernet=
=20
IP
phone chip enables toll-quality IP phones with the lowest power consumption.

Broadcom also introduced the first all-CMOS Bluetooth(TM) radio to achieve
Bluetooth qualification. This radio is designed specifically for use in mobi=
le
phone handsets and further extends Broadcom's Blutonium(TM) line of Bluetoot=
h
solutions.

Broadcom's tuner chip was the first to receive CableLabs(TM) certification a=
nd
EuroDOCSIS certification. This will continue to allow manufacturers to=20
utilize a
highly integrated CMOS tuner chip to replace the 200-plus discrete component=
s
housed in a tuner can to achieve greater reliability while meeting industry
standards.

Broadcom will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discu=
ss
its first quarter 2001 financial results and current financial prospects tod=
ay
at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time (1:45 p.m. Pacific Time). The company will broadca=
