Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic =
of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional=
 Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels=
 discussed all of the issues. =20

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:sc=
hemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (U=
niversity of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet),=
 John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for=
 generators in the Northeast). =20

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a =
real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot mark=
et should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch=
=2E  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (L=
MP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reli=
ant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also. =20

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedule=
s.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced sc=
hedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John =
Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then the=
re might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a bala=
nced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be=
 appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FE=
RC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommen=
d) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an =
ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effectiv=
e ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will =
probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week). =20

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules=
 and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said=
 liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rule=
s are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts be=
cause he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He als=
o said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able t=
o meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time=
 and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regula=
tion should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Ro=
y Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FE=
RC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs an=
d fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with =
Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandat=
ory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (=
lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Pub=
lic Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthu=
r (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a=
 day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This =
panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, mar=
ket monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree tha=
t the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary serv=
ices markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes th=
at there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced sc=
hedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to indepen=
dent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead marke=
t, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP re=
quirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed =
on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply=
 until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as w=
ell.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having diffe=
rent requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or=
 not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can t=
here be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree th=
at if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percen=
tage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Tran=
smission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out=
 on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.
