Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own littl=
e=20
world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almos=
t=20
4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have=20
established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm=
=20
starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alo=
t=20
of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay=
=20
at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur=20
and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with=20
them.  I feel very fortunate.

I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I=20
can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my=20
thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too=20
much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are som=
e=20
good dates for me.

November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you. =20
Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we=
=20
have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down=20
town.  Look forward to hearing from you.


Carol
