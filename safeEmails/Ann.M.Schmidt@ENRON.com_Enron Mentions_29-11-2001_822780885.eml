UK: Enron threatens double hit to credit tool market.
By Tom Bergin

11/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The credit derivatives market faced a double thre=
at from troubled U.S. energy trader Enron on Thursday, leaving dealers divid=
ed on whether the rapid growth of the market might be at risk.=20
Enron's troubles impact the market through credit derivatives contracts writ=
ten on the company, which would be triggered if it files for bankruptcy prot=
ection, and through deals transacted by its Enron Credit subsidiary, which s=
pecialised in trading credit protection on third parties.
Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow investors to hedge or=
 gain the risk of an issuer defaulting on a loan or bond. Default swaps, the=
 most liquid type of credit derivative, involve the buyer paying the protect=
ion seller an annual premium, measured in basis points.=20
Accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers said they had been appointed administrato=
r to Enron's European division on Thursday. Some dealers predicted that if E=
nron goes under, the credit derivative contracts on Enron and entered into b=
y Enron would be unwound in an orderly way.=20
"It will be another good example of how the market does work... it will rega=
in people's confidence in the market," said Guy America, vice president for =
credit derivatives at J.P. Morgan Chase in London.=20
IMAGE PROBLEM=20
However, other dealers predicted a messy conclusion.=20
"The impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market =
overall," said a default swaps trader with a European bank.=20
The most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swaps=
, that of U.K. rail operator Railtrack , resulted in banks calling in lawyer=
s to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations.=20
Dealers said Enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market, =
mainly in New York. As a privately negotiated market, it is difficult to get=
 accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on Enron, however, =
dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on Enron had been wri=
tten.=20
"(It was) one of the benchmark names for the US credit (derivative market)..=
=2Eso you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit throug=
h default swaps," said the European bank trader.=20
UNCERTAIN CREDIT INSURANCE=20
Potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure o=
f Enron Credit. The subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigation=
 tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt and=
 failing to pay.=20
If end-users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the le=
vel of credit protection they expected, it may make it harder for banks in f=
uture to convince more of their customers to start using the tools.=20
On the back of demand from end-users, Enron credit was active in the inter-d=
ealer default swaps market. A filing for bankruptcy by Enron Corp. could tri=
gger settlement on all the contracts into which Enron Credit entered.=20
This would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would be=
 concentrated among the limited circle of banks, mainly Enron Corp.s bank le=
nders, which accepted Enron Credit as a dealing counterparty.=20
"It was not broadly accepted as a counterparty," said one dealer, who added =
that he hadn't seen the firm in the market since October.=20
LENDERS FACE BIGGEST LOSS=20
However, most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credit=
 derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses.=20
"Counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure," said the =
head of credit derivatives at a Euroepan bank.=20
Dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the Enron Credit trading boo=
k but that this now looked unlikely.=20
"The banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently..were al=
so involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid to=
 take it into their own book," said one trader.=20
Shares in Enron fell 85 percent to 61 cents after a rescue deal by smaller r=
ival Dynegy Inc fell apart on Wednesday. On Thursday the company said it may=
 not pay previously declared dividends.

USA: U.S. stocks set to open flat to a little up.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher =
on Thursday following some upbeat corporate outlooks, but mixed economic dat=
a and the aftermath of the near-collapse of energy trader Enron Corp. could =
affect trading.=20
Enron , teetering on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in=
 U.S. history, plunged 85 percent in frenzied trading Wednesday. It dragged =
on the market as investors also sold amid worry that a rally from Sept. 21 l=
ows reached in the wake of the attacks on the United States was overdone.
"The Enron collapse may have significant ramifications on banks and other en=
ergy companies where contracts with Enron may now not be honored. And the En=
ron equity may be worthless," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist with bro=
kerage Fahnestock & Co.=20
Equity index futures were up but at one point off earlier highs after the re=
lease of data at 8.30 a.m. (1330 GMT) that showed a rise in jobless claims b=
ut also a rise in durable goods orders.=20
"There was a mixed response. We saw an encouraging number in the durable goo=
ds but it's too early to see this as a sustained trend up and layoffs contin=
ue to be a real concern," Ackerman added.=20
The number of Americans lining up for first-time jobless benefits rose by 54=
,000 last week, exceeding Wall Street expectations and showed continued weak=
ening in the U.S. labor market. The data showed the number of so-called cont=
inued claims rose by 301,000 to 4.02 million for the week ended Nov. 17, the=
 biggest one-week increase in 27 years.=20
Orders for costly U.S. durable goods surged at the fastest rate on record in=
 October by 12.8 percent to $184.8 billion, led by huge increases in orders =
for aircraft and defense capital goods. The data may help rekindle hopes tha=
t the economy has rebounded since the Sept. 11 attacks.=20
Equity index futures suggested a largely flat to slightly higher open. Decem=
ber futures for the S&P 500 index rose 1.70 points to 1,130.80 while futures=
 for the Nasdaq 100 added 8 points to 1,567. Futures for the Dow Jones indus=
trials gained 7 points at 9,720.=20
Other indicators flagged a mildly higher open. The indicative Dow Jones indu=
strial average , which is based on prices of Dow stocks trading in Germany's=
 Deutsche Boerse U.S. market segment, rose 45.95 points, or 0.47 percent, to=
 9,757.81.=20
The Nasdaq-100 premarket indicator was up 9.2 points, or 0.59 percent, based=
 on trading ahead of the open in the tech-heavy index's biggest stocks.=20
Hand-held computer maker Palm Inc. rose in extended-hours trading on Wednesd=
ay and pre-open trade on Thursday after the company said it expects to meet =
estimates. Palm rose to $3.7 pre-open from its Nasdaq close of $3.41.=20
Storage networking company Brocade Communications Systems Inc. rose to $30.3=
0 ahead of the open from a close at $28.82. The company reported quarterly o=
perating profits fell sharply as the slower economy kept many corporate buye=
rs on the sidelines, although the results beat Wall Street forecasts.=20
Enron, which finished at 61 cents on Wednesday, was a little higher in pre-o=
pen trading, at 69 cents. Enron sank Wednesday after rival Dynegy Inc. pulle=
d out of its planned $9 billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader. C=
redit rating agencies slashed Enron's bonds to junk status and shoved the on=
ce mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy.=20
Enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants Citigroup Inc. and =
JP Morgan Chase & Co. Inc. , which may suffer losses of more than $400 milli=
on combined on their lending to the energy trading group, according to at le=
ast one analyst.=20
On Wednesday, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average surrendered 160.74 =
points, or 1.63 percent, to 9,711.86, the largest drop in about a month and =
the lowest close since Nov. 12. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid=
 20.98 points, or 1.83 percent, to 1,128.52. The technology-laced Nasdaq Com=
posite Index dropped 48 points, or 2.48 percent, to 1,887.97.=20
In other pre-open activity, software provider FreeMarkets Inc. rose after ra=
ising its quarterly revenue and profit outlook after several large customers=
 renewed long-term contracts. Shares rose to $16.20 from a close of $13.59.=20
H&R Block Inc. , the No. 1 U.S. tax preparer, rose to $37.25 on the Instinet=
 trading system after closing at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange. The com=
pany raised its profit forecasts for the current fiscal year as its second-q=

UK: Enron Europe not seen in default on energy trade.
By Raj Rajendran

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Beleaguered U.S. energy trader Enron so far has n=
ot defaulted on any of its over-the-counter energy swap contracts in Europe,=
 dealers said on Thursday. But many in the trading community have arranged a=
lternative trades to cover their exposure as news emerged that Enron had sou=
ght protection from its creditors and appointed accountant PricewaterhouseCo=
opers as administrator.=20
Enron stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller=
 rival Dynegy fell apart on Wednesday. The company halted trading on its Enr=
onOnline platform on the same day.
"They haven't had any defaults yet. But nobody's trading with them at the mo=
ment," a dealer at a major oil company which had trading links with Enron sa=
id.=20
Dealers said Enron had been missing from the European oil OTC market for ove=
r a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as sig=
ns emerged of financial difficulties at America's largest energy trader.=20
In the oil market, Enron's trading activities extended right across the petr=
oleum product chain as well as various Brent crude derivatives contracts.=20
They said the Dated to front line (DFL) Brent contract, which balances the r=
isk of Dated Brent against the front-month IPE futures contract, had seen su=
bstantial activity on Thursday amid speculation that some players had moved =
to square off their positions against exposures to Enron.=20
"It's a case of closing up positions," a Brent trader said.=20
Dealers said Enron was believed to have closed positions on London's Interna=
tional Petroleum Exchange. The IPE declined comment.=20
The dealers said a shortlived price spike late on Wednesday on IPE and NYMEX=
 crude oil and NYMEX natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session o=
f short covering.=20
"There was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and W=
TI moved up. One broker was doing most of the buying and most people thought=
 he was covering for Enron. But the market came straight back down," said on=
e futures dealer.=20
An spokeswoman for the IPE said its compliance department was looking at Enr=
on's positions on the market and had been talking with financial services au=
thority and clearing house.=20
"We will be able to maintain the integrity of the market," the spokeswoman s=
aid.=20

Analyst: Enron To Have Minimal Material Impact On Brokers
By Chad Bray
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney analyst Guy Moszkowski said the =
troubles at Enron Corp. (ENE) will not have a material impact on brokerage f=
irms' credit and counterparty energy trading exposure.=20
In a research note Thursday, Moszkowski said the credit exposure to Enron am=
ong the larger securities firms - Morgan Stanley (MWD), Merrill Lynch & Co. =
(MER), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) and Lehman Bro=
thers Holdings Inc. (LEH) - is minimal and is largely hedged where it exists=
=2E
Among the larger brokers, only Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have "meanin=
gful" operations in energy trading, Moszkowski said.=20
"Against the backdrop of significantly improved risk management procedures i=
n the industry, we believe exposure to Enron has been curtailed for some tim=
e now, particularly as concern regarding the firm's credit worthiness is har=
dly a new development," Moszkowski said. "However, given the sophistication =
and complexity of energy contracts, we believe it is fair to assume there wi=
ll be some - albeit likely limited and, ultimately, immaterial - counterpart=
y exposure at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley."=20
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Strauss said Cit=
igroup Inc. (C) - Salomon Smith Barney's parent - and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co=
=2E (JPM) could have a total exposure of about $800 million to Enron, includ=
ing derivatives and secured lending. Total unsecured lending would amount to=
 about $270 million, or 8% of the total amount syndicated, he said.=20
Strauss said the Enron mess will likely cost Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase=
 about 5 cents a share and 10 cents a share, respectively.=20

Enron's Demise Leaves Counterparties With Tough Choices
By Sarah Spikes
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial trouble=
s have left counterparties with difficult choices.=20
Enron's significant trading presence in the U.K. electricity market means th=
ere are many trading partners who are counterparties in deals with a company=
 that looks bound for bankruptcy.
Since Enron revealed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last mon=
th related to controversial transactions with entities connected to former C=
hief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the company has taken a nosedive that =
was only momentarily relieved when it looked as if Dynegy might step in and =
rescue the company.=20
Most trading partners were quick to stop trading forward with Enron, althoug=
h some continued, and almost all U.K. companies have some exposure to Enron.=
 Several also continued trading short term contracts.=20
With the company as it is, there are two options for counterparties.=20
They can wait, anticipating that Enron will go bust, and then terminate cont=
racts, or try to invoke a controversial clause in their contracts and get En=
ron to put up more collateral.=20
An apparently much less likely option would be to sit tight and hope that an=
other buyer for Enron steps in.=20
Of course, terminating contracts doesn't guarantee payment. While Enron appe=
ars to have plenty of assets that could be sold to pay off its debts, the co=
mpany's record of inaccurate earnings reporting sheds doubt on the value of =
its assets as well.=20
Terminating parties would be reimbursed, or charged, based on a marked-to-ma=
rket value of their contracts.=20
U.K. power prices have declined sharply since the introduction of the New El=
ectricity Trading Arrangements in March, so parties with majority selling po=
sitions through Enron would suffer financial losses when they had to resell =
their power for a lower figure. But had they bought through Enron, they woul=
d be able to source the same power for less money on the U.K. market today.=20
However, the immediate future of power prices is uncertain, making it diffic=
ult to know exactly which contracts will be in or out of the money. In Augus=
t, just five months after the introduction of the New Electricity Trading Ar=
rangements, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced that wholesa=
le power prices were down substantially and that price volatility on the bal=
ancing market had all but stopped.=20
But this has changed with the onset of colder weather, after one of the warm=
est Octobers in recent history led to some complacency. The cost of having t=
o cover a short position has been spiking to well above GBP300/MWh routinely=
, and prices on the power exchanges have soared for peak time periods.=20
The National Grid has also recently issued several warnings regarding a syst=
em shortfall during peak hours.=20
The second option open to Enron's trading partners involves trying to invoke=
 a muddied clause in the standard U.K. power-trading contract - the material=
 adverse change, or MAC, clause.=20
Asserting that the downgrade of Enron's debt to non-investment grade status =
clearly calls the security of their contracts into question, they may be abl=
e get Enron to put up more collateral in support of the contracts.=20
Before the downgrade, it might have been tough to invoke this clause, but it=
's now a possible option.=20

Enron-Dynegy Merger Collapse Roils Europe's Power Mkts
By Sarah Wachter
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Amid news that Enron Corp. (ENE) will spin off its Europ=
ean operations, the collapse of a buyout from Dynegy Inc. (DYN) touched off =
a bout of volatile, frantic buying in European power markets Thursday, promp=
ting questions about financial liabilities for the region's power companies =
if Enron declares bankruptcy.=20
"There was panic this morning," a European power trader said, with frenzied =
activity in Germany, Europe's largest power market. Prices for the most impo=
rtant long-term German contract - full-year electricity in 2002 - moved a fu=
ll EUR0.40 up and down from one deal to the next. The yield curve strengthen=
ed as much as EUR0.20 cents sheerly due to Enron's troubles, even while elec=
tricity prices dropped, as buyers scurried to close out positions. Trade was=
 eerily quiet in the rest of the forwards market.
By midday, the Nord Pool Power Exchange, market operator for the Nordic regi=
on, excluded Enron from trading and clearing financial contracts for the fir=
m's Scandinavian arm, Enron Nordic Energy, which had failed to post margin r=
equirements. The UKPX followed shortly thereafter, and suspended Enron's tra=
ding rights.=20
Otherwise it was business as usual on other European electricity exchanges, =
which offer the security of clearing and settlement. German bourses in Leipz=
ig and Frankfurt, the LPX and EEX, and the Netherlands' Amsterdam Power Exch=
ange continued to allow Enron to trade Thursday in the spot electricity mark=
et.=20
It's a steep fall for the once-mighty Enron in Europe, said to account for a=
s much as 20% of all power trades in the region. Enron built up its European=
 book through an aggressive push in the region, challenging regulations and =
filing lawsuits to pry open the region's notoriously slow-to-deregulate powe=
r markets.=20
Also midday Thursday, consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers said they will admi=
nistrate a split of Enron's European operations, but won't be responsible fo=
r the energy sales branch. Enron traders - considered among the best and the=
 brightest in the industry - will be prize assets to be snapped up by other =
European trading houses, which are still expanding, as European power market=
s are poised for full market deregulation in coming years.=20
Many now wonder who will now fill the breach and continue to press for much-=
needed reforms.=20
"Enron was one of the few progressive companies promoting the trading busine=
ss," said Katrin Duerwald, an analyst with Germany's HEW Trading AG. "Contin=
ental power companies are conservative, and it's possible we'll enter a peri=
od of consolidation now."=20
Others wonder whether such a big counterparty can be replaced, and whether E=
urope's nascent power markets may experience a downturn in activity.=20
"Markets will probably dry up a bit. It will be more difficult for companies=
 to trade. It isn't completely obvious to me that these guys will be able to=

esearch head for UBS Warburg.=20
European power companies rushed Thursday morning to issue statements that th=
eir liabilities to Enron were limited, but analysts remain uncertain what th=
e true long-term liabilities will be, if Enron declares bankruptcy.=20
Long-term contracts will be a little more difficult to unravel, says Commerz=
bank utilities analyst, Mark Robinson.=20
Deutsche Bank was one of the few to estimate its full liability Thursday, sa=
ying it would come in under $100 million, according to a VWD press report.=20
Analysts say Enron did a good job of spreading around its counterparty risk =
in Europe, so large power companies may not take a big hit, but small utilit=
ies could suffer significant financial damage, HEW's Duerwald says.=20
In Germany, close to 600 small utilities have recently entered trading, and =
they tend to have lower risk management thresholds than big power companies.=
 They could either take a financial beating or decide trading is too risky a=
nd get out altogether, she said.=20
Enron's clout is greatest in Europe's lesser-developed power trading markets=
, like France and Spain, which could suffer a slowdown in development due to=
 a loss of liquidity if Enron collapses, a power trader said.=20
Traders said the fall of Enron has been a wake-up call for greater vigilance=

will become much more important, too," a power trader said.=20

REPEAT: Enron Bankruptcy May Lead To Losing Brazil Assets

RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) could lose the concession for=
 its Brazilian assets if it files for bankruptcy, Brazil's power sector regu=
lator Aneel said Thursday.=20
"According to Brazil's privatization rules, local assets controlled by Enron=
 would be transferred back to state control in case of insolvency," said an =
Aneel spokeswoman.
Enron controls Brazilian electricity distributor Elektro Eletricidade e Serv=
ico SA (E.EKO), which was acquired in 1998 for BRR1.479 billion ($1=3DBRR2.4=
8). It also owns two gas-fired thermoelectric plants: Eletrobolt, with a cap=
acity of 380 megawatts, and Cuiaba, with a 480-MW capacity.=20
The Houston-based company also owns important stakes in natural gas distribu=
tor Companhia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro (E.CDR), or CEG, and it=
s smaller unit CEG-Rio.=20
In late April, Brazil's oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR), or Petrobras, a=
greed to pay $240 million for the stake Enron owns in CEG. Petrobras agreed =
to buy the 25.38% stake the U.S. energy group owns in CEG as well as the 33.=
75% stake Enron has in CEG-Rio. The deal is seen closing in the next few day=
s.=20
CEG serves the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area, and CEG-Rio supplies indust=
rial towns in the greater Rio de Janeiro region and the interior of the stat=
e.=20
Enron, one of the heavyweights of the international power market, is widely =
expected to apply for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the downgrading of its=
 debt to "junk" status and the withdrawal of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) merger plan=
s Wednesday.=20
As reported, the Houston-based energy giant's shares, which traded as high a=
s $84.87 this year, closed Wednesday at just 61 cents, 85% lower than their =
opening price of $4.11.=20
Enron said it was suspending all payments other than those needed to maintai=
n core operations.=20
The company could still try to sell its Brazilian assets, although the sale =
of Elektro is unlikely given the large size of the company and the current u=
nfavorable market conditions, analysts said.=20
Elektro serves about 1.6 million clients in 223 municipalities in Brazil's i=
ndustrialized state of Sao Paulo.=20

Fall Of Enron Rattling Nordic Electricity Market
By Frances Schwartzkopff
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COPENHAGEN -(Dow Jones)- The precipitous fall of U.S. power giant Enron Corp=
=2E (ENE) hit the Nordic market Thursday, when the region's power exchange s=
aid the company's Scandinavian arm, Enron Nordic Energy, was excluded from t=
rading and clearing.=20
The development - plus the continual stream of news about Enron's woes - tri=
ggered worries among market participants over their exposure, and also over =
the possibility of wider spreads on the Nord Pool exchange if Enron Nordic E=
nergy closes up shop and liquidity in the market falls.
By the company's own estimates, it is the leading electricity trader in the =
Nordic market, where it first established its headquarters, in Oslo, in 1996=
=2E According to Enron Nordic Energy, it traded 77 terawatt-hours last year.=
=20
"If Enron would disappear from the Nordic electricity market, liquidity woul=
d be substantially reduced and there is a risk that spreads would widen," sa=
id Bo Andersson, an analyst with Graninge Trading in Stockholm.=20
Nord Pool announced Thursday that Enron Nordic had failed to post required f=
inancial security margins, and as a result it was being excluded from tradin=
g and clearing of financial contracts. It is still allowed to trade in the s=
pot market.=20
The announcement followed an earlier one Thursday that contracts to which En=
ron Nordic Energy is a party would no longer be cleared automatically. Inste=
ad, each would be evaluated separately, and additional financial security ma=
rgins could be required.=20
In acting as the clearing agent, Nord Pool assumes the financial risk to ens=
ure a contract is fulfilled. Nord Pool officials declined to say how large t=
he exchange's exposure would be, either in the financial or the spot market,=
 should Enron go bankrupt.=20
But they said the exchange was prepared.=20
"I am relaxed and calm," said CEO Torger Lien, adding he hoped the rest of t=
he market was too. "It's a bit messy when the larger players go bust, regard=
less of what business you're in. (But) we're set up to deal with this."=20
It's yet to be seen whether trading houses that have bilaterally traded cont=
racts with Enron not cleared through Nord Pool will be able to deal with the=
 company's closure, should it happen.=20
Traders declined to go on the record about their positions except to note th=
at those contracts are at risk.=20
Upwards of 80% of power contracts traded bilaterally are cleared through the=
 exchange, according to Nord Pool estimates. What share Enron has of the rem=
aining portion is hard to say.=20
The total volume of financial contracts traded on Nord Pool in 2000 was 359 =
TWh, while the spot market's traded volume was 97 TWh. Another 1,180 TWh fro=
m the OTC/bilateral market were reported to Nord Pool for clearing.=20
Observers said Enron's troubles could also open the market to other players =
and reverse opposition to mandatory clearing of bilaterally traded contracts=
=2E=20
Many traders have been opposed to the plan, which is currently under conside=
ration as part of Nord Pool's application to the Norwegian government to bec=
ome a licensed financial exchange and a licensed clearing house.=20
That may be one upside to Enron's demise, said Nord Pool's Lien. Otherwise, =
he said, "Enron is an innovative, strong company. It's quite sad."=20
But, he added, "They haven't gone bust yet."=20

Enron's Demise Leaves Counterparties With Tough Choices
By Sarah Spikes
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial trouble=
s have left counterparties with difficult choices.=20
Enron's significant trading presence in the U.K. electricity market means th=
ere are many trading partners who are counterparties in deals with a company=
 that looks bound for bankruptcy.
Since Enron revealed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last mon=
th related to controversial transactions with entities connected to former C=
hief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the company has taken a nosedive that =
was only momentarily relieved when it looked as if Dynegy might step in and =
rescue the company.=20
Most trading partners were quick to stop trading forward with Enron, althoug=
h some continued, and almost all U.K. companies have some exposure to Enron.=
 Several also continued trading short term contracts.=20
With the company as it is, there are two options for counterparties.=20
They can wait, anticipating that Enron will go bust, and then terminate cont=
racts, or try to invoke a controversial clause in their contracts and get En=
ron to put up more collateral.=20
An apparently much less likely option would be to sit tight and hope that an=
other buyer for Enron steps in.=20
Of course, terminating contracts doesn't guarantee payment. While Enron appe=
ars to have plenty of assets that could be sold to pay off its debts, the co=
mpany's record of inaccurate earnings reporting sheds doubt on the value of =
its assets as well.=20
Terminating parties would be reimbursed, or charged, based on a marked-to-ma=
rket value of their contracts.=20
U.K. power prices have declined sharply since the introduction of the New El=
ectricity Trading Arrangements in March, so parties with majority selling po=
sitions through Enron would suffer financial losses when they had to resell =
their power for a lower figure. But had they bought through Enron, they woul=
d be able to source the same power for less money on the U.K. market today.=20
However, the immediate future of power prices is uncertain, making it diffic=
ult to know exactly which contracts will be in or out of the money. In Augus=
t, just five months after the introduction of the New Electricity Trading Ar=
rangements, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced that wholesa=
le power prices were down substantially and that price volatility on the bal=
ancing market had all but stopped.=20
But this has changed with the onset of colder weather, after one of the warm=
est Octobers in recent history led to some complacency. The cost of having t=
o cover a short position has been spiking to well above GBP300/MWh routinely=
, and prices on the power exchanges have soared for peak time periods.=20
The National Grid has also recently issued several warnings regarding a syst=
em shortfall during peak hours.=20
The second option open to Enron's trading partners involves trying to invoke=
 a muddied clause in the standard U.K. power-trading contract - the material=
 adverse change, or MAC, clause.=20
Asserting that the downgrade of Enron's debt to non-investment grade status =
clearly calls the security of their contracts into question, they may be abl=
e get Enron to put up more collateral in support of the contracts.=20
Before the downgrade, it might have been tough to invoke this clause, but it=
's now a possible option.=20

Europe Fin Services Cos To Take Small Hit From Enron
By Evelina Shmukler and Catherine Taylor
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Europe's financial services groups are expected to be h=
it by Wednesday's downgrade of Enron's debt rating to junk, but analysts say=
 the impact isn't going to be as severe as it may first look on paper.=20
Many large European banks underwrote or arranged large loans for the trouble=
d energy trading company, but they've sold off a large amount of that debt t=
o other banks or insurers, mitigating the effects on their provisioning and =
balance sheets.
That syndication, however, makes it unclear at this point how much Enron deb=
t paper each bank and insurer in the region is holding onto.=20
Enron's troubles are a "good reminder that there is still high unexpected cr=
edit risk latent in the large corporate loan books of banks," said UBS Warbu=
rg's Anik Sen. But he estimates that the large European banks' exposure risk=
 is still relatively small.=20
In total, he estimates an exposure risk of about 2% of the market capitaliza=
tion per large European bank - or around the intraday volatility of most ban=
ks anyway. It represents about 5% to 10% of a bank's earnings as a one-off h=
it, implying, he said, that the banks' capital is not at risk.=20
Most of Europe's major banks, and some minor ones, have helped to finance lo=
ans for Enron. The bank's with the greatest involvement, according to Fox-Pi=
tt, are Barclays, ABN Amro (ABN), Credit Suisse (CS), Societe Generale (F.SG=
S), Credit Lyonnais (CL) and Dresdner Bank AG (G.DRS).=20
Fox-Pitt estimates these six banks each has exposure of $400 million to $450=
 million, and though the downgrading of Enron will increase financial market=
 risk generally, they said these banks will feel the weakening effect most.=20
Enron's debt rating downgrading is "clearly a significant event for European=
 banks," Sen said, but he pointed out most of the large European banks don't=
 keep all of those loans on their books.=20
"Banks are in the business of mitigating risk," he said. The few banks Sen i=
s concerned about are those that keep the loans as part of their core busine=
ss, rather than selling them off. These banks' holdings, especially those of=
 some German and Italian ones, could be a concern for shareholders.=20
Also smaller European banks, to whom even a small loan could be significant,=
 may find this situation a "painful experience," Sen said. Banks' Say Don't =
Overreact=20

The large European corporates, however, tend to not hold onto such loans. Ba=
rclays, for example, has said in the past that it sells down at least 90% of=
 what it provides via syndication.=20
A Barclays spokeswoman said Wednesday that the bank's exposure was not mater=
ial, but investors seem worried anyway. Barclays shares fell 4% Wednesday to=
 2093 pence. Thursday, shares fell another 1.5%, before recovering to a smid=
ge about the previous day's close at 2106 pence.=20
Investment bank Nomura, however, staunchly maintained its "buy" rating on Ba=
rclays shares, explaining the size of the exposure is being substantially ov=
erestimated.=20
But Nomura also said the potential fallout from an Enron bankruptcy will con=
tinue to weigh on shares of global wholesale banks until the issue is resolv=
ed.=20
European banks' share prices have already begun to feel it: ABN Amro was dow=
n 1.2% to EUR17.73 and Credit Suisse fell 0.4% to CHF64.90 at 1215GMT. Socie=
te Generale was down 0.8% at EUR61.75, and Credit Lyonnais fell 0.6% at EUR3=
7.64.=20
Commerzbank shares were off 2.3% to EUR 19.54.=20
Commerzbank spokesperson Dennis Phillips said the bank's exposure to Enron "=
is a low double-digit million Euro figure, and it has already been accounted=
 for in terms of provisioning for 2001."=20
French insurance group AXA SA (AXA) also said there would be no direct impac=
t on the company, even though one of its subsidiaries is one of Enron's larg=
est shareholders. An AXA spokesperson said that the subsidiary holds the sha=
res in an investment fund on behalf its investors. AXA shares were up 1% to =
EUR24.24 at 1230GMT.=20
In general, Europe's insurers are unlikely to have a large exposure to Enron=
, said Tom Bennett, a European insurance analyst at BNP Paribas. As far as t=
heir bond portfolios are concerned, they tend to make less risky investments=
 than banks, he said.=20
"They don't invest in junk, it's the basic rule," he said. "People are prepa=
red to take much more risk [at banks]." Large, listed European insurers "ten=
d not to invest outside the investment grade area, and Enron hasn't been tha=
t for ages."=20
In the U.K., both Standard Chartered PLC (U.STA) and Royal Bank of Scotland =
Group PLC (RBSB) have some exposure to Enron, but spokespeople at both banks=
 downplayed any potential risk.=20
Carolyn McAdam of Royal Bank of Scotland declined to say to what extent the =
Scottish bank was exposed to Enron.=20
"All we're prepared to say just now is that Enron is obviously a very large =
business, with a range of business interests and assets," she said. "And it'=
s far too early at this stage to reach any firm conclusions on the level of =
our exposure."=20
Standard Chartered also said it has some exposure.=20
"But it is very small. We're probably one of the smallest, if not the smalle=
st, lenders in one of the syndicates, so it's small stuff for us," Standard =
Chartered spokeswoman Pamela McGann said.=20
She declined to quantify "small," but said, "it's not something that's going=
 to keep me awake tonight, that's for sure."=20

Dollar Under Pressure on U.S. Economic Woes, Enron Situation

11/29/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires=20
NEW YORK -- The dollar was under pressure Thursday, weighed down by a combin=
ation of the Federal Reserve's somber outlook for the U.S. economy, waning U=
=2ES. consumer confidence and concerns about the financial woes of Enron Cor=
p.
In morning New York trading, the euro was at 89.04 U.S. cents, up from 88.82=
 cents late Wednesday in New York. The dollar was at 123.07 yen, little chan=
ged from 123.06 yen late Wednesday.=20
The greenback was also at 1.6480 Swiss francs, compared with 1.6465, while s=
terling was trading at $1.4254, down slightly from $1.4259 late Wednesday.=20
The dollar managed to get a brief respite from U.S. durable goods data for O=
ctober, which showed orders for big ticket items sharply rebounded by a reco=
rd amount, more than reversing September's large drop.=20
But the overall tone for the dollar remains weak, amid a growing sense that =
the U.S. might not be able to rebound from recession as fast as previously t=
hought.=20
"The dollar is a little heavy across the board," said Robert Sinche, head of=
 global currency strategy at Citibank in New York. "Unless you get something=
 completely outrageous, it looks likely to remain that way."=20
The dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and the=
 yen, as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions.=20
While the Enron situation doesn't have a direct effect on foreign exchange m=
arkets, analysts said that it wasn't helping dollar sentiment.=20
"The market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions," said Mr. Si=
nche. "Enron...is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst."=20
As is often the case, the euro's gains appeared to be more a result of pessi=
mism towards the U.S. rather than any optimism about the euro zone.=20
The market largely shrugged off third quarter euro-zone gross domestic produ=
ct data earlier Thursday which came in exactly as expected: up 0.1% on the q=
uarter and 1.3% on the year.=20
The dollar's direction Thursday will also be influenced by U.S. shares, with=
 prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the Enron woes.=20
Analysts said a sustained move above the 89 cent level could set the euro up=
 for a test of 89.45 cents and then 90 cents, which is expected to offer mor=
e formidable resistance.=20
Its difficulty in making a concerted push for 90 cents is probably down to t=
he potential outflows related to the Morgan Stanley Capital International in=
dexes rebalancing, and the Deutsche Telekom/Voicestream deal.=20
The first phase of the new MSCI weightings comes into effect Friday, and sho=
uld involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities.=20
So far, this seems to have been discounted, although it could still help to =
keep a lid on the euro.=20
The lockup period for Voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their Deutsch=
e Telekom shares expires Dec. 1, which could prompt them to offload the stoc=
k, in effect resulting in sizable euro-zone outflows.=20
Benign inflation data from Switzerland out earlier Thursday - up only 0.3% i=
n November on the year - has paved the way for the Swiss National Bank to cu=
t interest rates at its next meeting Dec. 7.=20
"With the market looking only for a rate cut of 25 basis points, we would ex=
pect the Swiss franc to remain capped around current levels," said UBS Warbu=
rg analysts.=20

"Electrabel had anticipated the actual situation for the past month, and has=
 taken a number of measures to reduce its positions," an Electrabel spokesma=
n said. "Our exposure is totally insignificant."
Electrabel has stopped trading with Enron, and began reducing its trading ac=
tivities with Enron back in August, when news started to emerge of Enron's d=
eteriorating financial condition.=20
Electrabel has an asset-based trading strategy, not a policy of speculation,=
 he added.=20
The spokesman declined to detail the amount of Electrabel's liabilities with=
 Enron. Analysts are skeptical of statements power companies are making Thur=
sday about their limited liabilities to Enron, saying it isn't clear whether=
 the figures given represent gross exposure, or what the liabilities will be=
 if Enron goes bankrupt.=20
Enron is thought to account for up to 20% of all power trading in Europe.=20
Enron is widely expected to apply for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the do=
wngrading of its debt to "junk" status and the withdrawl Wendesday of Dynegy=
 Inc.'s merger plans.=20

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today expre=
ssed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken s=
teps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being exper=
ienced by Enron, including instituting a trading halt.=20
"Although we didn't completely cease trading with Enron until yesterday, in =
the course of our normal credit practices, we took steps to limit our exposu=
re to Enron. We currently have approximately $100 million in non- collateriz=
ed exposure to Enron. We are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation t=
o determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate," said Richard J.=
 Osborne, executive vice president and chief risk officer for Duke Energy.
Osborne was referring to Dynegy's announcement that it is terminating the me=
rger agreement with Enron and the decision by major rating agencies to downg=
rade Enron's long-term debt below investment grade.=20
"The market is larger than any one player and is very resilient. Enron's rol=
e and activities in the energy market have significantly diminished over the=
 past several weeks. And, market liquidity is provided by many active tradin=
g and marketing companies that have effective risk management practices and =
sound capitalizations," Osborne noted.=20
"We at Duke Energy are committed to our customers and fulfilling our contrac=
ts and services without disruption. We also continue to see strong growth op=
portunities ahead and are extremely confident in our ability to achieve or e=
xceed our financial targets this year and next," Osborne said.=20
The company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its st=
ated guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings=
 per share from a base of $2.10 in 2000. Based on the strong results reporte=
d for the first three quarters of this year, Duke Energy had previously comm=
unicated it will likely exceed 15 percent earnings growth in 2001. Yesterday=
's developments do not change that view.=20
Duke Energy, a diversified multinational energy company, creates value for c=
ustomers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and=
 expertise. Duke Energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and elect=
ric supply, delivery and trading businesses -- generating revenues of more t=
han $49 billion in 2000. Duke Energy, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., is a=
