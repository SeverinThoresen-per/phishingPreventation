The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for =
the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the clos=
e date to July 1).  Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be =
completed before the close.  Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations =
and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explain=
ed earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicin=
g and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in Jun=
e.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in foll=
owing up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding ac=
tivity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantiall=
y after June 30. =20
