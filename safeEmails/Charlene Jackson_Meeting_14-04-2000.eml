Sally,
Thanks for the voice-mail.  While we have selected a date, it is not cast in=
=20
stone.  If there is another date that works better and would allow more of=20
the individuals to participate, that is fine with me.  I just want to make=20
sure that the Program is being responsive.  Incidentally, I did not realize=20
that Rick would be out of town, so it is no problem to change the date.

You indicated that you would be willing to provide a few bullet points=20
regarding the issues you and the group would like for us to address.  That=20
would be great.  Please forward those at your earliest convenience.  =20

I will assume that you will notify the other individuals of the date and tim=
e=20
of the meeting, Wednesday, April 19th at 10:00 a.m.   If this assumption is=20
not correct please provide the names of the other individuals who will atten=
d=20
the meeting and I will call them.  Also if you decide it makes sense to=20
change the date, just let me know.

Thanks for your assistance.
