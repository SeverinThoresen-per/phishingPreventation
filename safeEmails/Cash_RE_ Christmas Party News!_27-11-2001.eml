Hey Gang:

Dave's staff meeting was attended by women in a party mood and Kirk with som=
e limited veto rights!  We have tentatively scheduled a casual family Christ=
mas party for Dave's Gang for December 8 at Alicia's house in the Heights.  =
This is a kid-friendly event with a street party twist - we'll start with a =
casual dinner at 5pm at the Goodrows then, weather permitting, travel by foo=
t, wagon, stroller, bicycles, scooters or similar modes to the Lights in the=
 Heights Street Party a few blocks away.

We'll send out better invitations next week.  But please mark your calendars=
 and inform your household event coordinators now.

Check out the attached link to Lights in the Heights for more info about car=
