Rick, I believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts -- almost eve=
ryone has emailed me with that information already, pursuant to my prior req=
uest.  I'll forward those to you for your information.  I would like to inst=
itute some limitations on training for the group, due to costs and out-of-of=
fice considerations, but I have not finalized those recommendations yet.  St=
ay tuned!  MHC
