Subject: Update

Can  someone please update me as to where we stand on:

1) Legal Review
 - Do we have a complete list of master agreements yet for all companies on=20
the mailing list?
 - Has legal reviewed the counterparty list and noted any with which they=20
think we cannot do business?
 - Has legal adjusted the above to reflect differing state laws? (i.e. has=20
not applied a broad brush to all states on account of restrictive laws in=20
some)?

2) Credit Review

Can someone fill in the blanks in the attached matrix of credit to-do items=20
with the current status and/or ETA of each item?

Profile =3D Collateral/Non-Collateral/R-O access status identified
Headroom =3D Credit limit to be used against sigma factors
Tenor =3D maximum deal length limit
List 1-4 =3D As per Bob's spreadsheet
List 5 =3D This is what I am calling the original list of companies which=20
credit rejected, but for which they were going to do some additional analysi=
s=20
to see if all of them really should have been rejected (the list of 400=20
"rejected" companies which credit sent to us).

  Profile  Headroom  Tenor =20

List 1  Done =20
List 2 =20
List 3
List 4
List 5

3) Sigma factors

Who is looking after this? When will it be completed for each Product Type?


Thanks,

Dave=20
