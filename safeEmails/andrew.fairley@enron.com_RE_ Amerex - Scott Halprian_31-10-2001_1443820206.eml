Keith,

If you would like to come in and see the office on the 9th I can sort that o=
ut no problem.
Scott was suggesting that you would be over, and that he would like to meet =
me with you at the same time.

Any interest in a few beers that night?

Andy,

Coincidentally, I will be visiting London November 9th-11th and thought I mi=
ght visit Enron's offices.

I am unaware of Amerax's penetration into the UK energy markets, but they ar=
e among the top three in North America.  As far as brokers go, Scott does a =
good job.  He is straight forward and honest and consequently was getting th=
e largest share of our business in the west.

If you are interested, I would be happy to introduce you to Scott during my =
trip.  My schedule is fairly flexible.

Keith=20

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some =
pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set =
up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here =
in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Andy
