Ricardo,
There are several thresholds for meeting the regulatory exemptions for=20
trading derivative transactions, the most common one is that the counterpart=
y=20
have $10,000,000 in assets.  If the counterparty does not have $10,000,000 i=
n=20
assets we will have to see if they meet any of the other tests.  We will nee=
d=20
to know what country the counterparty intends to trade from and what type of=
=20
legal entity it is.  We need to be sure that the counterparty is in a=20
jurisdiction, and is the type of entity, that has been approved for financia=
l=20
trading with ENA.  In order for us to prepare a master agreement for the=20
counterparty you will also need to coordinate with credit in order for them=20
to tell us what credit terms we need to include in the master agreement. =20

Also, because ENA does not trade Brazilian power I believe you will have to=20
work out an arrangement on the commercial side to have ENA enter into the=20
deal and back-to-back it out again to another appropriate Enron Entity to=20
manage the risk.  You will need to get the tax group involved to ensure that=
=20
we structure this properly. =20

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Regards,
Brent

Brent,

We are working on a financial swap transaction and need some information.=20
Remi Collognes suggested me to look for you.

Our customer is a private-equity fund that invests in "green-type" of=20
projects in Latin America. The largest shareholder is an European bank. One=20
of the projects is a biomass cogeneration facility in Brazil (sugar cane),=20
that will reach approximately 70MW after full completion. The SPC that owns=20
the project has already entered into a 10-year PPA with an LDC (CPFL).

However, the fund manager wants to get exposure to the Brazilian spot price=20
for the first three years. Therefore, he is looking for entering into an=20
off-shore financial swap agreement with Enron, having the Brazilian spot=20
price as the underlying object. In this transaction, he would be "selling" t=
o=20
Enron a fixed price and buying the floating spot price. He is also working o=
n=20
a letter of credit to place as collateral for the transaction.=20

This transaction is totally off-shore, and will not occur under Brazilian=20
jurisdiction. I understand that the customer and Enron will have to enter=20
into a Master Swap Agreement. Given that, my questions are as follows:

1. What is the threshold and what are the requirements from a legal=20
standpoint for a customer to trade with Enron?
2. What are the necessary legal procedures to close this transaction?
3. Is there any chance I can get a draft of a master swap agreement?

Please let me know if you or someone else can help me on the matters above.=20
Should you have any questions you can reach me by e-mail or call 55 11 5503=20
1326 in Sao Paulo office.

Thanks,

-Ricardo
