Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is=20
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I=20
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.=
 =20
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out o=
f=20
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So=
=20
