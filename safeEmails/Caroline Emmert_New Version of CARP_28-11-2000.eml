Glenn Anderson let me know that there is an updated version of the CARP=20
report in EnPower Stage, and he wanted me to test it before putting it in=20
production.   He would like to get it into production before month close=20
comes up.  I know there are other users who should also test it, so that's=20
why I am sending this note to all of you.  If you know of other users who=20
should test it, as well, please forward this message to them.

After you have tested it, please send a note to Glenn letting him know=20
whether or not you approve it.

Thanks,

Caroline
