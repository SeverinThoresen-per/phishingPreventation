APPROPRIATION BILLS WRAPPED UP

When President Bush issued his proposed fiscal year 2002 budget to Congress =
last April, investment in research and development was not a top priority in=
 most federal agencies.  Eight months and a major terrorist attack later, Co=
ngress and the President agreed to put aside their disagreements over fundin=
g levels for most federal programs until another day. =20

Here is a brief summary of how energy and space research programs fared in t=
he recent appropriations cycle.  Information on funding for research program=
s at the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards an=
d Technology, and the Department of Defense will appear in Update next week.

Energy

Funding for energy research and development programs are divided between two=
 appropriations bills - Energy & Water and Interior.  The Energy Committee o=
f ASME's Council on Engineering submitted testimony last spring on the energ=
y programs contained in both bills.  Copies of the testimony are available a=
t:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-21.html
and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-22.html

The Interior bill provides funding for fossil energy and energy conservation=
 R&D programs.  In its testimony to the House and Senate Appropriations Comm=
ittees, the COE Energy Committee recommended several key areas that it belie=
ved merited increases above the President's request.=20

In all of those areas - carbon sequestration, advanced gas turbines, and fue=
l cell research - Congress ultimately supported the ASME Committee's recomme=
ndations.  For carbon sequestration, the President had requested $20.6 milli=
on, the ASME Committee had recommended $29.6 million, and Congress ultimatel=
y appropriated $32.1 million.  The President had proposed eliminating the ad=
vanced gas turbine program; the Committee had recommended that funding be re=
stored to a level of $30 million, $1.1 million more than in FY 2001.  Congre=
ss decided on a level of $18.5 million.  For fuel cell research, the adminis=
tration had proposed $45.1 million, a reduction of $7.2 million from the FY0=
1 level.  The ASME Energy Committee had recommended $61.1 million, and Congr=
ess appropriated $58.1, which was higher than either the House or the Senate=
 had recommended in their individual bills.

In the Energy & Water appropriations bill, renewable energy research funding=
 was set at $396 million which, while $40 million less than the Senate bill,=
 was $20 million above the House-passed number, $120 million above the Presi=
dent's request, and $21 million above current levels.

Nuclear Energy Research received $250.5 million, which is $27 million more t=
han the President's request, but $9 million less than current levels.  The N=
uclear Energy Research Initiative received $32 million, which is $19.2 milli=
on more than the President requested, $15 million more than the House versio=
n, but $6 million less than the Senate recommended and $3 million less than =
the ASME Energy Committee recommendation.  The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimiza=
tion Program received $7 million, which is $2 million more than the Presiden=
t's request, the House bill, and current levels, but $2 million less than th=
e Senate bill, and $3 million less than the Energy Committee recommended.

DOE science programs were funded at $3.2 billion, an increase of $73.2 milli=
on over the budget request and $52.7 million above fiscal year 2001.  High e=
nergy physics was funded at the request level of $716.1 million.  Nuclear ph=
ysics also was funded at the request level of $360.5 million.  Biological an=
d environmental research received $527.4 million, an increase of $84.4 milli=
on over the request. Funding for basic energy sciences was set at $1 billion=
, a decrease of $1 million from the request, although that total includes fu=
ll funding for the Spallation Neutron Source.  The Advanced Scientific Compu=
ting Research Initiative was allocated $158 million, a decrease of $5 millio=
n from the request.  Finally, fusion energy research was funded at $248.5 mi=
llion, the same as the request and the COE Energy Committee recommendation.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Funding for NASA's R&D programs is included in the VA-HUD and Independent Ag=
encies appropriations bill.  National Science Foundation programs also are i=
ncluded in that bill.  ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D has tas=
k forces that prepared testimony on both NASA's and NSF's budget requests.  =
 Copies of the testimony can be found at:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/=
01-11.html
and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-23.html


Overall, NASA received $10.2 billion for its research programs, which is $34=
3 million, or 3.5 percent, more than it received in FY01.  Of that amount, $=
1.72 billion is allocated for the International Space Station, which is a $4=
40 million, or 15.2 percent reduction from last year.  Congress is increasin=
gly concerned about cost overruns on the station, and has been highly critic=
al of NASA's management of the project.  Among programs receiving substantia=
l increases were Aero-Space Technology, which received a 12.4 percent ($275 =
million) increase, for a total of $2.49 billion; and Space Science, which re=
ceived $2.84 billion, $224 million, or 8.5 percent, more than last year.


MATH AND SCIENCE PARTNERSHIPS AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NSF

When President Bush announced his education plan last February, he proposed =
a Math and Science Partnership Initiative at the National Science Foundation=
, emphasizing a need for better science and mathematics education across the=
 country.  Possible partners for the Math and Science Partnerships could inc=
lude the State Education Agency, a math, science, or engineering department =
of an institution of higher education, a high need Local Education Agency, b=
usinesses, and nonprofit and for-profit groups of demonstrated effectiveness=
=2E

The House and Senate Education Committees, when drafting their education leg=
islation, also thought the Math and Science Partnership program was needed, =
but placed the program at the Department of Education.  In the end, now that=
 the authorization and appropriation process is complete, there are programs=
 at both NSF and Department of Education.  The two agencies are in fact form=
ing a task force to address the issue. =20

The FY 2002 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations conferees only appropriated $=
12.5 million for the newly-established Math and Science Partnerships at the =
Department of Education, which were authorized at $450 million in the recent=
ly approved Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization Act.  However, =
the FY 2002 VA/HUD appropriations bill, provided another $160 million for si=
milar partnerships to be awarded by NSF.

In addition, the Labor-HHS-Education conferees encouraged states to continue=
 making science and math instruction a high priority by also using other fed=
eral funds available for teacher improvement.  A total of $2.85 billion was =
appropriated for overall Teacher Quality.  =20

GAO BEGINS NEW INVESTIGATION INTO FEDERAL OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY

In response to a request by Representative John Dingell, ranking member of t=
he House Energy and Commerce Committee, the General Accounting Office has be=
gun another investigation into the Department of Transportation's Office of =
Pipeline Safety, specifically focusing on OPS's approach to preventing terro=
rist attacks like those of September 11, and whether the OPS has sufficient =
resources and personnel to deal with such events.

On October 3, GAO released an investigative report on OPS that said the agen=
cy had made progress, but still had the lowest rating of any transportation =
agency in implementing National Transportation Safety Board recommendations.

For more information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.

BUSH NOMINATES ORBACH TO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF SCIENCE

President Bush has announced his intention to nominate Raymond Orbach to be =
Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Science.  The Chancellor of=
 the University of California Riverside since 1992, Orbach served for ten ye=
ars as Provost of UCLA's College of Letters and Science.   He has also serve=
d on numerous professional, scientific, and civic boards, as well as held vi=
siting professorships at institutions in several countries, including Tel Av=
iv University, the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, and=
 the Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielle de la Ville De Pari=
s.
=20
DOE's Office of Science is responsible for the department's civilian researc=
h in high energy and nuclear physics, fusion energy sciences, basic energy s=
ciences, biological and environmental research and computational science, an=
d ten DOE civilian laboratories.
