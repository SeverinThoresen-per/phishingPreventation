I want to keep you informed about my visa status.
My current H1B visa expires on 15th January, 2000.  My H1B visa extension=20
application has been submitted to INS by Milenia Soto, Enron's immigration=20
attorney.  I spoke with Milenia Soto yesterday and came to know that she has=
=20
not received the receipt yet, however, she told me that it is perfectly lega=
