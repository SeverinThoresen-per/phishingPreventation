Doctors say gay and straight men who are getting Viagra and combining it wit=

Large numbers of homosexual men, and a smaller number of heterosexuals, are =
combining Viagra with illicit drugs to achieve a potentially deadly "sexual =
high," a new study finds.=20

The men combine the popular impotence drug with illicit "club drugs" such as=
 ecstasy, ketamine, amphetamines, GHB, and "poppers."=20

The study, discussed last week at the Centers for Disease Control's HIV ( ne=
ws <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/searc=
h/news?p=3D%22HIV%22&c=3D&n=3D20&yn=3Dc&c=3Dnews&cs=3Dnw> - web sites <http:=
//rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=3DHIV>=
) Prevention Conference, focuses on high-risk behavior among gay men who use=
 Viagra to heighten their sexual experience.=20

San Francisco epidemiologist Andrea Kim, who conducted the study, says it an=
d other studies in California and London have shown that "gay men are combin=
ing Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexu=
al men" and that puts them at higher risk. Her sa common side effect of club=
 drugs is loss of erection.=20

"We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function, so the me=
n are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability," Kim says.=20

Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite, an inhaled stimulant comm=
only referred to as "poppers."=20

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emer=
gency room physician Dr. Daniel Keyes says that "amyl nitrite makes the hear=
t race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events."=20

Like Viagra, amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood p=
ressure. Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a perso=
n has a heart attack or stroke.=20

Although rare, another medical condition that can occur is priapism, a sever=
ely painful problem that can result in permanent damage caused by the penis =
being erect for many hours.

CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led pol=
ice to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did =
for a living, police said Wednesday.=20

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than=
 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behi=
nd the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the sou=
th end of the island.=20

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaura=
nts near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around =
the complex in full view of families dining out.=20

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked=
, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer=
 writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he d=
id for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.=20

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in h=
arvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to =
go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.=20

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they desc=
ribed as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation."=20

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complica=
ted watering system with a line running to each of the plants.=20

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the sys=
tem used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and=
 handed it to an officer.=20

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana =
for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a bett=
er life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a di=
sease, and for other "medically ill people."=20

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but=
 that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.=20

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed=
 them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.=20

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was c=
ooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicl=
es.=20

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is=
 not named because charges have not been filed.=20
