If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA=20
or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.  I=
f=20
you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charg=
e=20
on TCO at all. =20

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SS=
T=20
Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the=20
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).


Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it=20
has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough.

I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a
stray.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!
