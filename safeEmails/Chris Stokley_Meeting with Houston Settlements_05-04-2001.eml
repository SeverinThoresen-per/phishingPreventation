	While I agree with you that having you go to Houston would be productive, i=
t is a luxury that we cannot afford. We are currently four and a half months=
 behind on our actualization process, with both the internal and external cu=
stomers running out of patience. With also have Brett leaving this Friday an=
d Donna out until next week, I need you to focus solely on getting us actual=
ized for the months in question. We also have a deliverable to Seattle City =
Light by the end of this week. Until we get these items settled, I can not a=
llow the transition of duties between yourself and Virginia to take place as=
 we had planned. We all want this transition to happen, but we have to get t=
hese deliverables out the door.  I hope that you can understand that with al=
l of these issues on the VM plate, my answer will have to be no to your goin=
g to Houston.=20

Chris,

I understand that Virginia has been approached to head down to Houston and m=
eet with the Settlements group.  I would like to be part of that as well, if=
 that is alright.  There are still some things they do on their side that I =
would like to learn about, and I think that Virginia and I could collaborate=
 on a sharing of information meeting and both would get a lot out of it.

Let me know.  I guess the date hasn't been settled, yet, but I am available =
pretty much any time in the next few weeks.
