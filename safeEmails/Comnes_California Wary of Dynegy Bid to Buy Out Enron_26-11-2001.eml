California Wary of Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron
Energy: Both companies are prominent players in the state's power market. Th=
e move to combine their strength is raising some concerns.
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS
TIMES STAFF WRITER

November 25 2001

Dynegy Inc. of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street, as it rides=
 to deliver cross-town rival Enron Corp. from its self-inflicted ills and sa=
ve energy markets from serious distress through its proposed $9-billion buyo=
ut of the world's largest energy trader.

But in California, Dynegy has a different image.

Dynegy, co-owner of several Southern California power plants, has been the q=
uietest member of the "Big Five" group of energy producers commonly portraye=
d as villains by California politicians and regulators. Gov. Gray Davis and =
others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers "gougers" and "pir=
ates" who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity, preci=
pitating California's blackout-studded energy crisis. Partly because of the =
heightened political sensitivities to all things surrounding California's en=
ergy problems, the state is expected to play a central role in the proposed =
merger between Dynegy and Enron, antitrust experts and others say. The state=
's Attorney General's office already has begun scrutinizing the proposed com=
bination.

If it merges with Enron, another favorite Davis target, Dynegy would be a po=
werhouse in energy trading, electricity generation and natural gas transmiss=
ion. And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California, which=
 some find troubling.

"I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would c=
onsider this one carefully," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), one o=
f the architects of California's failed foray into electricity deregulation,=
 who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers. "If anything, =
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate market=
s than it was before."

Dynegy agreed on Nov. 9 to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about $9=
 billion and to inject $2.5 billion into crumbling Enron provided by cash-ri=
ch ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco-based oil company that owns nearly=
 27% of Dynegy. But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclosures=
 keep slamming Enron's stock price, indicating that investors have their dou=
bts that the deal will be completed as negotiated.

The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy, which is about a quarter of Enron's si=
ze, into the top ranks of energy merchants.

In California's energy world, Dynegy already is a key company. At every sign=
ificant twist in the state energy crisis, Dynegy was there, although not as =
visibly as some of the other power-plant owners and electricity resellers.

Enron and Reliant Energy Inc., also of Houston, and Duke Energy Corp. of Cha=
rlotte, N.C., drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates d=
uring the last 18 months as energy leaped higher. But Dynegy also was accuse=
d by the state's grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its elect=
ricity bidding practices and, to a lesser extent, by holding back some elect=
ricity from its Southern California power plants.

In addition, Dynegy signed long-term electricity contracts with the state th=
at have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative cla=
uses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs.

The California Independent System Operator, which runs the long-distance pow=
er transmission grid serving much of the state, has asked federal regulators=
 to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices. Cal-ISO has made the sam=
e request concerning the other major power plant owners: Duke, Reliant, Atla=
nta-based Mirant Inc. and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., which markets its pow=
er through an agreement with Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.

"Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar," said Doug Heller of the Founda=
tion for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a consumer activist group.

"Not only did Dynegy do very well, but particularly its trading and marketin=
g division did very well over the course of the last two years. It profited =
wildly."

For its part, Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation, saying it h=
as played a constructive role in the California marketplace, stepping forwar=
d to be one of the first companies to sign long-term contracts with the stat=
e when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of $300 million owe=
d the company by the state and its utilities.

"Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California," said Dynegy spok=
esman John Sousa. "The fundamental problem in California is that supply did =
not keep up with demand."

"Dynamic Energy"

Accused of Overcharging

Dynegy was created in 1984 as a natural gas trading operation known as Natur=
al Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas pr=
ices. Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson, the company has expanded into natu=
ral gas processing and distribution and electricity generation, changing its=
 name along the way to Dynegy, a word created by combining "dynamic" and "en=
ergy."

In California, Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating 2,800 megawatt=
s of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis. =
(A megawatt can supply about 750 average homes with electricity.)

The state's big investor-owned utilities were required to sell some of their=
 power plants by the landmark 1996 deregulation legislation. By the end of 1=
998, the Dynegy/NRG partnership had purchased three large power plants in Lo=
ng Beach, El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of 17 small "peaker" pla=
nts from Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

Under the arrangement between the partnership, NRG operates the power plants=
 and Dynegy markets the electricity from them. It is Dynegy's bidding practi=
ces in selling that power into state markets that put it, along with other e=
nergy producers, on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federal en=
ergy regulators.

Among the allegations:

* In a report released in March, Cal-ISO accused energy producers and resell=
ers, including Dynegy, of overcharging Californians by $6.7 billion between =
May 2000 and March 2001. Power suppliers have denied the allegations. The re=
port also found that Dynegy reaped about $32 million in "monopoly rents" bet=
ween May and November of last year, or profits beyond what a competitive mar=
ket would bear. That was the fourth-highest total for any company noted in t=
he report. Enron was ranked sixth, taking $27.9 million in such profits.

* Cal-ISO said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known a=
s "economic withholding," or bidding electricity at prices so high that they=
 would be rejected, thereby pushing up the price charged for the remaining g=
eneration sold into the market. Dynegy also did some "physical withholding,"=
 Cal-ISO said, meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies to dri=
ve up the price.

* Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoar=
ding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in 1998 and 1999, c=
ausing natural gas prices to soar. Dynegy executives testified that the char=
ge was untrue.

* When federal regulators ordered $125 million in potential refunds for the =
first four months of the year, Dynegy's portion was the largest among the po=
wer sellers named, representing slightly more than one third. Dynegy said it=
s prices were justified by high natural gas prices, emissions costs and othe=
r factors.

Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was "unfai=
rly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California market=
=2E"

"As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulator=
s and to industry officials, we remain ready and willing to generate and sel=
l power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are ab=
le to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obligation=
 to pay for those purchases."

A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegy's=
 assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market.

During the first three months of this year, after sky-high prices pushed Edi=
son and PG&E so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy po=
wer for their customers, Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price of=
 $239.63 per megawatt-hour for electricity. That was slightly below the aver=
age of $268.90 per megawatt-hour charged by all sellers.

Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market, represent=
ing about 4% of the state's generation.

But Cal-ISO, in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegy's authority to se=
ll power at market rates, said "Dynegy has profited systematically from the =
exercise of market power to the significant harm of California's electric co=
nsumers and economy." A decision is pending.

Officials reviewing the Dynegy-Enron merger will closely review the companie=
s' operations in California.

Although Enron owns no power plants in California, it is believed to have lo=
ng-term contracts with some generators, although spokesman Eric Thode refuse=
d to detail them.

In addition, Enron has a hand in 25% of the energy trades around the nation,=
 with a significant portion of that in California. Thode would not detail Ca=
lifornia operations, citing company policy.

Finally, Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas, which is used=
 to generate about one-third of the state's electricity, through its transwe=
stern pipeline, which crosses into California, and through natural gas marke=
ting and trading arrangements.

It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many ene=
rgy watchdogs worried. They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy can =
drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time.

A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bust=
amante, acting as a private citizen, described it this way: "The Dynegy trad=
ing floor, working with the trading floors operated by Williams, Mirant, Rel=
iant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used to in=
flate the price of electricity within their respective markets, as well as t=
hroughout the state of California."

"These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures, forwards, optio=
ns and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflating=
 the price of electricity within their respective markets," the suit charged=
=2E

"These defendants engaged in 'megawatt laundering,' in which they made trade=
s with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within thei=
r respective markets."

State Is Examining Proposed Merger

California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a m=
erger would have on California, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. The Federa=
l Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will sc=
rutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take no m=
ore than nine months.

Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said she p=
lans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the co=
mpanies own in the market to examine "inputs" into the market such as gas pi=
peline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy and En=
ron.

"It really raises many questions about how the market works," Bowen said.

Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger, said Gar=
ret Rasmussen, a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington, D.C., and formerly =
a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator.

The state, if it chooses, could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotiat=
ions over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Micros=
oft Corp., he said.

"While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers ... an action =
by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of succes=
s," Rasmussen said.

Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation

The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power =
contract with Dynegy, which contains the unusual provision that the state wo=
uld pay for any emission costs that the company incurred, said V. John White=
, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency & Renewable Technologies in S=
acramento. Dynegy's large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution control eq=
uipment, he said.

"The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegy's environ=
mental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the long-ter=
m contract," White said. "Dynegy has a Texas, the-least-we-can-do attitude a=
s far as the environment is concerned."

David Freemen, the former Los Angeles Department of Water & Power general ma=
nager who helped negotiate Dynegy's and other long-term contracts, said that=
 while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves, the agreements, =
now maligned as too expensive, were key to stabilizing the electricity marke=
t. Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process.

"There's a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and reac=
hed agreement--like Dynegy, Calpine and Williams--and those that were reachi=
ng for the moon and we didn't reach agreement," Freeman said. "Dynegy knew t=
hat they wanted to do business in California, and do it in a businesslike ma=
nner."=20
