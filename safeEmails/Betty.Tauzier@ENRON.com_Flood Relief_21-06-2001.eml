Words can never express my heartfelt gratitude for the funds you made availa=
ble to those of us who suffered losses because of the flood.

The experience was so overwhelming.  The devastation of so many was heart wr=
enching.  Your generosity is so awesome, and I appreciate all that you are d=
oing to help others as well as myself.

God bless you and thank you.

Sincerely,
Betty
