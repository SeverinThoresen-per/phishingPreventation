Dear Team, =20

I know that some of us have been regularly updating a file for Bob named "Pu=
lp-Newsprint-Corrugated" on the O:/ drive.  Should we not do this anymore?  =
Stacey may want to use that file as a template for the new one...just an ide=
a.

Thanks!
Vikram =20

In the interest of giving Bob Crane regular weekly access to our major marke=
t numbers, could you please help out in the following way:

I believe you have a spreadsheet that contains your basic market data (produ=
ction, shipments, consumption, producer ivnentories, consumer inventories, e=
xports, imports etc.). In future, when you update this spreadsheet with trad=
e association data etc., could you save it twice: once in your normal drive,=
 and once in a new file that Stacey will create, to be called Bob and locate=
d in the Industrial Markets folder on the O: drive.

Thanks,

Dave
