Jeff:
Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves=20
entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back=20
with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:

1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete=
=20
the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this=20
conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance whic=
h=20
allows for recovery of attorneys fees.

2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction=20
clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit,=20
execution, attachment or other legal process.

Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps=20
that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase=20
Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what=
=20
we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we=20
ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting=20
them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so i=
f=20
there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done=
,=20
that would be great.
Carol
