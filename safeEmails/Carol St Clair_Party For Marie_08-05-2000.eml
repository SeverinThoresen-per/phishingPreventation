I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for=20
Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it=20
won't happen.  Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your=20
house?  We were just going to limit it to the swap group.  Let me know what=20
you think. =20
