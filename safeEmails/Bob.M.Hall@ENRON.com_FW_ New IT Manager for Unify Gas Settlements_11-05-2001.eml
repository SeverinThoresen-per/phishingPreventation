Just to keep you in the loop.   I am addressing this we IT.

I have a problem with us pulling experienced personnel off the unify when
it's not working for the current users.  We have a major backlog of enhancem=
ents
and bugs that need attention. =20

Hi Bob,


I'm sorry you read about this proposed change in an email before I had a cha=
nce to communicate this to you in person.  This was one of the ideas we were=
 considering in order to accommodate Chris' focus on EIM/EGM requirements go=
ing forward.  I wanted to run this by you and Leslie before anything was fin=
alized.  We can talk about this next week and see what makes the most sense.=
  I understand your concern about bugs and enhancements that are in the back=
log.

I will schedule some time early next week for us to get together.

Thanks,

Ramesh

This move just gives me a little concern.  I was able to ask for another per=
son
to be looking at volume management that Matt currently has, and now he has
settlements also.  This appears to be a lot.  We have a long list of items b=
oth
bugs and enhancements coming once we are out of code freeze for all three pa=
rts.

Let's talk about this next week.
