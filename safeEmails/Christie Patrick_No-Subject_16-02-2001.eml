Hi Vince!

meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly=20
stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation a=
t=20
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to=20
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the=20
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30? =20
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested=

in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

Please note that the remaining videoconferences scheduled with Enron have
been changed to teleconferences due to the difficulties we have experienced.
The host has agreed and we will, therefore, continue with teleconferences in
the same locations/dates as noted above.

Any questions, please contact the FAP office.

Thanks,
