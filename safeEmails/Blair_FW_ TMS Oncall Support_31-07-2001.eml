Subject:	TMS Oncall Support

All,
After talking it over with Lynn Blair, and with Sheila Nacey's agreement, th=
e TMS Oncall support hours are being modified.  Instead of the current rotat=
ion that requires 2 developers to be oncall each working day plus a third pe=
rson fulfilling the responsibility on the weekend, the TMS team is experimen=
ting with a rotation of one oncall person for work days and one for the week=
end.  The TMS team will still continue to provide oncall support from 6:30A =
to the end of the last cycle.

The only noticeable change during this 6 week experiment will be the onsite =
support hours, which will now be from 6:30A to 6:00P.  Following is an outli=
ne for oncall procedure during this period:

1)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide on-site support from 6:30A to 2:00P
	At times when the Oncall does not feel comfortable about being able to comm=
ute to office before 6:30A, the Oncall will 	provide support from home until=
 he/she is able to hand off the responsibility to TMS team member onsite.
2)  TMS team, collectively, will provide the on-site support from 2:00P to 6=
:00P
	Before leaving, the Oncall person will make sure that one of the team membe=
r, already on-site, has accepted the 	responsibility for answering oncall pa=
ges
3)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide off-site support from 6:00P to the en=
d of processing for last cycle

There will be no change to the weekend oncall procedures.

John/Terry,
please make sure that all schedulers are aware of the above change.

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. =20

Thanks
