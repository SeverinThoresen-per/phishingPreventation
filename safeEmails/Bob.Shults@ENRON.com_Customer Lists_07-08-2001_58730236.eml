Brad/Jay,

Based upon discussions with legal, operations and IT we have come up with a =
recommended solution for the customer list issue.  Below is an outline of ou=
r recommended procedure for dealing with price hosting arrangements on Enron=
Online.  We will continue to hammer down the details but wanted your approva=
l prior to implementing this process.  We would like to implement immediatel=
y after finalizing details.

1. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft a new Password Application which a=
cknowledges third party price postings on EnronOnline.  Beginning immediatel=
y new customers will receive the amended Password Application. =20

2. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for a customer pop up box=
 which does the following: (1) Acknowledges the addition of third party pric=
e postings (2) requests permission to supply third party price posters with =
their company name (3) warrants that the acknowledging party has the authori=
ty to accept the new terms.

3. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for the third party GTC t=
hat amends the Password Application and ETA to cover the company who is post=
ing that product type on EnronOnline. Before a company is able to transact o=
n the third party product type, they will need to read and sign the GTC with=
 third party language.  If the third party has already signed an GTC type ag=
reement with the third party price poster, they will still see an amendment =
to the signed agreement which amends their Password Application and ETA to i=
nclude the third party when they first try to transact.  Before the customer=
 is able to transact they will need to read and sign the GTC amendment. =20

3. Jay will put language from 2 above in a pop up window that only goes to M=
aster Users.=20

4. We will put the pop up on for at least one day and then gauge the number =
of response to determine how long to show pop up.  Marketing will contact as=
 many master users as possible prior to pop up display.

5. We will distribute company names to third party price posters for profili=
ng.

6.  When third party postings go live we will contact Master Users to inform=
 them that they need to approve transaction status for third party product t=
ypes (normal process for new product type launches).

Please let me know if this is ok.
