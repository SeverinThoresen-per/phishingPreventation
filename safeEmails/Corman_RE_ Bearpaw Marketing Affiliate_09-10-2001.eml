I was referring to the fact that Bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of=
 NNG and is posted as such on the website.  Bearpaw has a transport contract=
 on NNG.

I want to clarify something from our Reg Roundtable earlier today. Bearpaw i=
s currently a "potential marketing affiliate" of NBPL, and so far has not  c=
rossed the line to actually trigger an event that would make them a full fle=
dged MA. We are careful not to trigger such an event. Bearpaw may be a MA of=
 NNG due to some contract activity on NNG, but that is not a problem for NBP=
L. Shelly, if you see it differently, please let me know.

    Bill
