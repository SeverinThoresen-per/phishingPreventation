Elizabeth,=20

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be des=
igned to give the marketers "talking points"  and the other is going to be a=
 technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of sca=
ry war stories.=20

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron pol=
icy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of "How En=
ron views the WSPP" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.  =20

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI sho=
uld be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI e=
xperts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparin=
g the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every =
amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements clo=
ser and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer =
to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like=
 the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes tha=
t a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements.=20

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide a=
n extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be foc=
using on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready fo=
r RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in=
 Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization i=
s spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract =
from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortun=
ate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does=
 add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organi=
zation is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ev=
er narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions.=20

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because o=
ur marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondogg=
les.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all ab=
out the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cou=
r d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult ques=
tions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to fee=
l loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP fo=
r being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become=
 even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over t=
o more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it ha=
s done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we no=
w should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff w=
rapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agend=
a.  =20

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise=
, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistan=
ce and much toxic upheaval is the only result.=20
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of peopl=
e sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts =
of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personal=
ities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  =
They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regiona=
l diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our hea=
dquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   =
pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these gu=
ys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the pol=
icy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint com=
mittee approach.   ----cgy =20
