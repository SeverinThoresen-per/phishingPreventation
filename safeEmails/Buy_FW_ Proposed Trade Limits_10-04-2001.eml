Rod and Dan,

As discussed in this morning's meeting, we have taken a look at the types of=
 trades that we feel appropriately relate to our underlying transport and st=
orage business (basis, spreads, fixed price) and recommend the following lim=
its for the trade policy:

VAR:			$2 million
Net Open Position:	15 Bcf
Maturity/Gap Risk:	18 Bcf


I will set up a meeting for later in the week to discuss the approval proces=
s related to the policy and procedures.

Kent
