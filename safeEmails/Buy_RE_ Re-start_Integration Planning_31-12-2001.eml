Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more det=
ailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their =
re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you h=
ave all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really n=
eed to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer=
 who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to d=
o the same thing.=20

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.=20

Thanks=20

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integra=
tion Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back pl=
ans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Severa=
l plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub=20
+       Development             Jay Webb=20
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster=20
+       HR                      David Oxley=20
+       Cash Management Tom Myers=20
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett=20

The rest will be completed shortly.=20

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different=
 focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  p=
lans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each=
 of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of=
 the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a sugges=
ted outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Pleas=
e decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually=
