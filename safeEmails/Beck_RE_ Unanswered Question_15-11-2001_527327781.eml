Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be gi=
ven to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings th=
at normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give co=
nstructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our =
time is focused on managing Enron's business.  HR should be sending informat=
ion out soon to all employees on the details. =20

The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company'=
s intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the proc=
ess that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to in=
dividual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for Februar=
y, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that. =20

I am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the com=
e up.  --Sally =20
