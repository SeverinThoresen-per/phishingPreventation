Brenda - All that is coming through to settlements on this is a demand=20
charge.  I have actualized
receipts and deliveries, and in "offered services" it says billing basis is=20
on delivery, which it should be,
except on mcf's not dth's, but it's still not coming through to settlements.=
 =20
What do I need to do?   Let=20
me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118
