Re:  First Collection Milestone Achieved

Several weeks ago, we told you we believed we had hit our first cash collect=
ion milestone, and indeed we have.  Representatives for the unsecured credit=
ors' committee and the ENA examiner are currently validating our cash collec=
tions and we expect them to verify the milestone very soon.  The bankruptcy =
court judge has also signed the official motion related to the retention and=
 LIP plans, so it is final with no additional follow-up with the court requi=
red.  Soon, all the pieces will be in place to make our first Liquidation In=
centive Pool dispersement.  Because it will be our first dispersement, we ar=
e taking the needed time to establish an accurate and equitable process for =
this and future payouts.  We plan to hold a meeting with all LIP participant=
s in the next week or two to walk through the procedures we've developed and=
 answer any questions.  We'll be in contact with you soon to schedule that m=
eeting. =20

Thank you,
Robert Jones
