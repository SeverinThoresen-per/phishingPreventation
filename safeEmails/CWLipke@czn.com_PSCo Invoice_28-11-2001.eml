I spoke to Amy before lunch... I need the $$ invoice from PSCo!!  She faxed
the volume (meter) statements which I needed also, but I need the summary
and the four individual (Bayfield, pines, Pagosa, La Plata) invoices showing
the reservation vols/ $$ and the commodity charges, etc. =20

Amy was going to call someone at the pipeline or I can try to call them to
express the urgency if you want me to.  Please help.
