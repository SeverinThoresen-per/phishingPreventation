Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dr=
eyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zon=
e 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee. =
 I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supp=
ly each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (4=
05-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their cont=
ract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1,=
 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Domini=
on, he prepared the termination letter. =20

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing=
 Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a le=
tter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.
