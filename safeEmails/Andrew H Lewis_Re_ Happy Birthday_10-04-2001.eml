Vicky,

Sounds like they've been working you to hard.  You certainly deserve a vacat=
ion.  I would like to hear about your adventures overseas.  My address is as=
 follows:


			Andy Lewis
			3131 Timmons Ln
			Apt. 1010=09
			Houston, TX  77027



I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give =
them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course, gett=
ing time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your trip,=
 and I look forward to hearing from you.

-Andy
