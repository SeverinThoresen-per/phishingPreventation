Last week they made $35,000 total.  They made $20,000 one of the days.  We=20
had some problems accessing this transmission and others were getting it=20
before us, so we talked about submitting more requests (I anticipated that=20
several traders would submit a request at the same time).  In Enron trader=20
fashion, they automated the submission, which then created the problem for=20
SPP.  Since the problem with SPP is now solved, they told me that they shoul=
d=20
be able to get this transmission most days when ERCOT is a better bid than=20
SPP, as well as on days when SPP is better (same process for coming into=20
SPP).  They said this will be valuable to them year round on most days.

P.S.  The FERC lawyer that SPP called is Stuart Fischer, who was my major=20
Hotline contact for Summer 99.  He gave me some helpful info about what FERC=
=20
had told MAPP with a similar computer problem on MAPP's DC tie line.  Then h=
e=20
said that he wants to talk about EPMI's other hotline concerns and problems!

A plug for the desk help!

Yesterday, SPP called FERC because the hourly desk was submitting 150=20
requests for the same transmission (within several minutes) over the DC tie=20
in order to meet the noon allocation.  I spoke with SPP and FERC and=20
compromised in submitting less requests, plus we changed our program to work=
=20
more efficiently.  This change still resulted in the hourly desk winning the=
=20
transmission (worth appr. $20,000 day).
