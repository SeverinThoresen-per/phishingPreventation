I don't have any firm bids but I have the following information. =20

In order for Sequent to purchase gas from us they require some sort of legal=
 document showing that Enron has title to the gas.  She won't be able to pur=
chase gas from us until next week.  Their notional bid for gas at the hub is=
 Nymex - $0.03. =20

I received Oxy's gisb contract this afternoon and have forwarded it on to le=
gal for review and comments.  I ask for a notional quote this afternoon.  My=
 contact had told me he would have a notional quote this afternoon.  However=
, he has been in meetings since 2:00.  I will call back tomorrow.  They have=
 inquired if they could by the gas in the ground and manage the transportati=
on agreement so they would have the daily flexibility.  I told them I didn't=
 think that was possible but I would check.  I also told him that we could p=
ossibly offer some daily flexibility with a daily deadline.

That's today's news.

We are serious, but we can't commit yet--we have to work out issues with B/L=
=2E  We think we can work those out over the next week.

Have they indicated any price range of pricing?
