Fletch-

We are moving all relevant Risk Management files over to the new environment=
, but will not be doing anything with specific files used only by the tradin=
g group.  If any of you had an templates or files that you used to follow yo=
ur positions or estimate your curve shift outside of the Curve Manager, you =
will need to identify and move those (or possibly have your analysts move th=
em?).

Let me know if you have any questions about specific Risk related files you =
would like to ensure are being moved.

Thanks-

Andrea
