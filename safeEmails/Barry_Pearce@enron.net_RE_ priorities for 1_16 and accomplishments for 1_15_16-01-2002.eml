1/15 -=20
curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with P=
wC.  I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on thi=
s at 10 today.  We have also had initial discussions with the different risk=
 groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our d=
eliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan =
to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the  make up of the DPR. =20

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information.  So f=
ar, we have only had one request for it.  My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA a=
re complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time.  Chris should have a com=
plete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!).  Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and =
Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems=
 fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31=
 as soon as all of the information is available.  She has also started the n=
et assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system=
 we can start pulling info by counterparty.


Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate=
), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the di=
fferent buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analys=
is

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.

Regards
