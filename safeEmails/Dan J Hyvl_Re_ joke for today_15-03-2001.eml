NEW LANGUAGE
-Submitted by PATRICIA L GOONETILLEKE

The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will=
=20
be the official language of the EU rather than German which was the other=20
possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded=20
that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 yea=
r=20
phase-in plan that would be known as "Euro-English".

the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of=20
the"k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the=20
troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like=20
"fotograf" 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to=20
reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments wil=
l=20
enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to=20
akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent "e"s i=
n=20
the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th"=20
with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year,?ze unesesary "o" kan be drop=
d=20
from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer=20
kombinations of leters.

After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor=20
trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze=20
