The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no=20
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should=20
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at=20
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is=20
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which t=
o=20
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides=20
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission=20
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability=20
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or=20
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY=20
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy=20
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect=20
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now)=
,=20
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the=20
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use=20
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push=20
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical=20
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overla=
y.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to=20
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator t=
o=20
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to=20
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use=20
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be=
=20
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted=
=2E=20
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes=20
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers. =20
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium=20
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced.=20

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market=20
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it=20
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to=20
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for=20
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then the=
y=20
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they=20
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestio=
n=20
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is=20
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient=20
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the=20
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide=
=20
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business. =20

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a=20
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on=20
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load=20
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.
