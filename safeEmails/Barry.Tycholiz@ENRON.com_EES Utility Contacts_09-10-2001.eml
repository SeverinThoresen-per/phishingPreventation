Louise, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer =
( George Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest.... t=
he reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on ga=
s structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customer=
s and EES would help them create or structure ..

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying t=
o promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help.=20

Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to dat=
e in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider the=
m a primary wholesale customer.

I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my pee=
rs was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my co=
mments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.

Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.

regards,=20

BT  =20
