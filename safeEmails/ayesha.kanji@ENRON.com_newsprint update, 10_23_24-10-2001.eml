Good Afternoon Team,
=20
Not long after acquiring the mill as part of its merger with Alliance, Bowat=
er will cut 300 of 1,000 jobs at the Coosa Pines mill in Alabama.  After pos=
ting weak 3Q01 results, Bowater is cutting costs.

For the 3Q01, McClatchy Co.'s  revenues dropped 5.5%, advertising revenues w=
ere down 6.5% from 2000 and circulation revenues declined 1.2%.  To keep cos=
ts down, McClatchy has reduced  the width of The Sacramento Bee's pages to s=
ave newsprint.  Its newspapers include The Fresno Bee, The Modesto Bee, The =
News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., The News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash., and the=
 Anchorage Daily News in Alaska.  As NA newsprint demand is already stagnant=
, let's hope other newspapers do not decrease their newsprint consumption.

I will be back in the office tomorrow afternoon.  Please call me at (832)721=
-3286 if you need anything.

Ayesha
