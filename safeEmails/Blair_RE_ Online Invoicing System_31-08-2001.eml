	Randy, I think it would be a good idea to do some training in Omaha.  But w=
e should
	coordinate it to cover all customers in the Omaha area.  Then we can do it =
in one trip.
	Thanks. Lynn

Debbie,
	All the reports will be available online, EXCEPT for the ones I do manually=
 and specifically for UCU, such as the Daily Allocation report.  However, th=
is report is now being emailed to Keith the day of close, thus preventing th=
e lag time in mailing and data entry on your part.  I am also looking into a=
utomating more of the information that we send you for commodity invoicing, =
such as the required screen prints.  Once this information is automated, I w=
ill also be able to send those via email or other methods. =20
	As we get closer to production for the system, I will speak with Lynn Blair=
 to see if I can set up a training session in Omaha for you, Keith and possi=
bly Joni.  I'll keep you informed.  Thanks.

Randy

Debbie,  =20
    I just wanted to let you  know that NNG will soon be implementing a new =
online invoicing system.  This will allow UCU to pull their own  invoices an=
d backup off the internet immediately as they become available,r  ather than=
 having the day lag for mailing.  Although the system is somewhats  elf-expl=
anatory, I think some training will be beneficial for everyone  involveddue =
to the amount of information/reports UCU receives. =20
    At this point, we are still  in the testing stage of the new system but =
I just wanted you to be aware that  this is the direction that the invoicing=
 is goingin the upcoming months.  As the system goes into production, I  wil=
l once again contact you to set up a convenient time and location for  train=
ing.  If you have any  questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thank=
s. =20
