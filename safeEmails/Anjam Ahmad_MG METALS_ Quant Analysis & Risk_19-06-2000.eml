Hi Eric,

Thanks for getting back to me - I believe there are a number of issues to=20
address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management=20
and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a (by no mean=
s=20
exhaustive) list:-

i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic=20
options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different optio=
n=20
pricing add-ins)
ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we=20
can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data=20
for this).
iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our=20
methods and systems and vice versa

These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with=20
relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the=
=20
process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative=
=20
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes=20
smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to=20
involve me.

Best regards,

Dear Eric,

I understand from Dale that you are co-ordinating the integration of MG=20
Metals into Enron Europe.  Dale and I thought it would be a good idea to=20
ensure that we are fully prepared from a quantitative research and=20
structuring perspective so that we can "hit the ground running" when they do=
=20
arrive.  I would be grateful if you could provide a contact person in MG=20
metals that may look after this area, or someone who may find it useful to=20
discuss and identify their possible future modelling requirements.=20

Thanks & regards,
