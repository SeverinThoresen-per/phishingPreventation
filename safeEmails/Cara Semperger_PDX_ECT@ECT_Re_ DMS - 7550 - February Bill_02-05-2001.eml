I believe the preschedule loss charge is valid for 2/9/01, as I see no loss =
schedule represented on the scheduling sheet.

Hi Amy!

I tried to return your call from yesterday this morning, but only got your v=
oice mail.

The February bill for $341.90 was for two days:  February 9th and 14th.  Feb=
ruary 9th (Tag No. 16259) was priced for 1 MW @ $207.99.  February 14th was =
a real-time transaction with no tag for less than a MW priced at $133.91.  I=
 checked our records and saw no energy return for losses to WACM from Enron =
at any time during February.

Please call if you have further questions.
