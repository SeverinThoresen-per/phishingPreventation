Thanks very much! I'll check it out.

Monika, could you forward to me the file with your market pulp originator ne=
wsletter in it? Some of our originators would like to send it out of the com=
pany to potential counterparties, and I would like to look at the wording to=
 make sure we can send it out: the wording for an internal document may be m=
ore frank and open than a document that's intended for external distribution=
=2E

Peggy, did I hear you say you got some legal language for a disclaimer for s=
teel? I wonder if we can use that on the market pulp and other originator le=
tters to make sure they can be used externally?
