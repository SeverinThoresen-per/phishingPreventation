B,

DCR:  405 E. 82nd St, # 4G, NY, NY 10028.

Unfortunately I am still on the treadmill of travel.  This weekend I have to
go to some Robinson siblings dinner that Chris is trying to start as a
tradition... real thrilled about that one.  Be glad you don't live
close.........I want to just stay home and sleep, but that isn't happening.
Next weekend, wedding in NJ, following weekend wedding in Alabama.

Definitely game for the turket trot....

Speak soon.
