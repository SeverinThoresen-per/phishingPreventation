I'm done!

I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading. I have to set up the=20
economics page but that shouldn't take long.

What about reversals from our currency book? Which way do the reversals from=
=20
the other books go?

The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physica=
l=20
position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.

I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully this makes things=20

Chris
