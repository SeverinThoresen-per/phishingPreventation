Update:  This morning I visited with Laura Rupp to check on the status of th=
is payment and she reported this was sent 12/21.  This afternoon I received =
a check from BP Canada in the amount of $5,443.08 which represents payment i=
n full for these PPAs.  This should clear City of Duluth's A/R.

I cannot believe I am so excited about getting money I have no control over!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (=

 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returnin=
g to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.
