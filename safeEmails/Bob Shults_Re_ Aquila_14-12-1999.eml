I have talked to Aquilla on several occasions (including today) and they=20
continue to say they are capable of playing by the rules.  I will talk to=20
them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade=20
physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).  They have=
=20
asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.  W=
e=20
do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do=20
not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a=20
messy situation.  I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or=20
myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can=20
check into it immediately. =20

All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila. =20
Mark Taylor will draft the agreements and Aquila has agreed to this.

We need to know what the resolution plan is to getting Aquilia straight for=20
trading Physical and Financial products.   Today we saw Aquilia Risk trade=20
Next Day Physical Gas again and we were asked to move the deal to Aquilia=20
Energy.  What is being done to get Aquilia Risk from continuing to enter=20
Physical trades on line?  My concern for this trade was that we brought it t=
o=20
Credit's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal=20
to Aquilia Energy until late in the day (4.45pm) which affects Logistics=20
ability to nominate for next day business.  Logistics has been made aware of=
=20
the late nom and will be working with the Pipe to get the nom in.  If there=20
are issues with this late nom from the pipeline we will let you know.

I'm not comfortable with the internal process of  counterparty name changing=
=20
of EOL deals and would like to get comfortable with how we are going to set=20
this process up.  I think there should be legal review of all deals that we=20
change and would suspect that some form of communication would need to be=20
conveyed to the counterparty. =20
