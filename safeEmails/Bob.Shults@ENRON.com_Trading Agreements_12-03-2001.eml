Bob:

It was nice talking to you today.  I wanted to pass along Derek's contact
information and vice versa.  Derek will be sending you our trading agreement
shortly, per your request.  Please note that the version we are using does
not differ materially from the version Enron reviewed during 4Q 2000.  Derek
Gamble is thoroughly familiar with our trading agreements and will be able
to answer any questions you may have for HoustonStreet.  Please do not
hesitate to contact me directly though, if I can be of any assistance.  As I
mentioned during our call, Enron is my top priority.

Best Regards,
John
