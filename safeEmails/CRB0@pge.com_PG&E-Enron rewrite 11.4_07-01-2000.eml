Dan:
How about this?

11.4 (2nd paragraph rewrite)
> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 11.5, in the event
> that a Force Majeure properly noticed by one Party under Article 11.2 (and
> causing the failure to purchase or sell Gas), results in the imposition by
> a Transporter on the other Party of Imbalance Charges or Operational Flow
> Order (OFO) or Emergency Flow Order (EFO) noncompliance charges or similar
> charges, the Party providing the notice shall reimburse the other Party
> for such charges to the extent the other Party, within a reasonable time
> period after receiving notice of Force Majeure is unable, consistent with
> the tariffs or procedures of the affected Transporter(s), to revise or
> correct its nominations in order to reflect the Force Majeure event or
> occurence.
>
Do you wish to keep the changes we proposed in fax in 16.3 or delete?

If this works, I will prepare 2 finals (US & Canada).  Let me know.
thanks,
charlotte
