John/Bill,

Canadian GD books (e.g.166860) are already set up in Tagg/Erms using MC.  Pl=
ease continue to use MC for the GD books and use MK for the P/B/I books.

I'll update the book names on our side to reflect the changes.  And the P/B/=
I books will be created today.

Please let me know when the corrections are made.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Bill,

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short na=
me and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871,=
 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we=
 also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that=
 they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I w=
ill be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as v=
oice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks=
=2E


John
