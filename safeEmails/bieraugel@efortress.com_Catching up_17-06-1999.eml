Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your law
degree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like you
are really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like
fun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,
they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I got
back from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'l
spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship in
the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm getting
pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two
years.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born
4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate
is too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.
Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.
My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.
When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is working
semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing
boats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers for
surfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is the
biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library
science and information technology.  He did really well and now has a job
with Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computer
geeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we can
work in a visit.  Possibly after March next year unless you're out in San
Diego while Im in the Gulf and you can look Michele up.  Keep in touch and
well work something out.  Take care Gerald.  Paul.
