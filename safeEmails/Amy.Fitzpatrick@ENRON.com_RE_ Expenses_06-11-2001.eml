Louise -

Tammie has checked and all but one of your expense checks for 2001 have been=
 cashed.  Tammie indicated that you should have received a check mid-Septemb=
er in the amount of $4,069.72 for your last expense reimbursement claim - th=
is check has not been cashed as of yet.

Do you still have it or would you like to have Tammie get it reissued?

Thanks!
Amy
