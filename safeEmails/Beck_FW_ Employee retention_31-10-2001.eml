Sally, Bob - just a thought about where we currently are and how we help mai=
ntain solid leadership for the future. As I looked around the room at your b=
reakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important managemen=
t roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, work=
 hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (college,=
 etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Others were=
 probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's the quic=
k hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly I'm in =
the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about the sever=
e impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans and how the=
 time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short time here (3=
 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a great Associa=
te and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediately to the com=
pany. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce that provides =
great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this has led to the gr=
eat success over the years. However at the end of the day the business requi=
res a level of maturity and experience that very effectively complements thi=
s young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things together and keep the=
 sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in their mid to later ye=
ars of their work life. During the good times no problem as bonus $'s and ot=
her vehicles take care of things. However we are possibly in a situation whe=
re those are limited or reduced to some extent for some extended period of t=
ime. =20

Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle =
aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value y=
ou add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retireme=
nt plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the company l=
ook like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the "quick hits" elsewher=
e? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we keep =
them here before they take another job that offers them additional security?=
 Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question about pe=
nsion I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement program we have=
 in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we'll give y=
ou this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash balance option=
 is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron's is rather =
weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%. Obviously th=
is all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considered over the yea=
rs and changing anything at this point is not going to happen. In addtition =
this probably goes against our culture in many respects and I'm not saying l=
ets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our workforce as we ha=
ve in the past and deal with employees that do not contribute regardless of =
age.=20

Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned =
when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loyal=
ty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certainl=
y have my concerns as I know you do also. =20

Thanks for listening - Bob=20
