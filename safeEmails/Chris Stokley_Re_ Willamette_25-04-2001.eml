I will look into what timeline that we can get these guys paid on and talk w=
ith you today. As far as the other issue, we are no where close to being abl=
e to take that project on. The current new hires are just to get us caught u=
p in the short term. After that, then it may be a do able item, but right no=
w all I want the new guys concentrating on is getting us caught up. I see th=
is hand-off taking place sometime in the 3rd qtr of this year, when we get t=
he rest of our staff in place.

Chris,

I just received a call from Willamette Ind. concerning our future business. =
It seems Aquila is making a proposal for Willamette's business.=20
Willamette is reasonably satisfied with their Enron relationship with the ex=
ception of the time it takes for Enron to settle California business.  They =
mentioned that timely settlement of the outstanding balances for November an=
d December would be helpful in discussions with their upper management.

I'm confident that Enron will retain Willamette's business, but it would be =
extremely helpful if we can get them paid for CISO business for November and=
 December before the end of April.=20

Let me know what Volume Management needs from Services to get Willamette pai=
d for Nov. and Dec.

On another topic, with your new hires coming soon can we shift the settlemen=
ts for Services Customers, like we've discussed, to Volume Management?


Regards,


Les Rawson
