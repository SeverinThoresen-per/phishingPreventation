OK, Updated rules on the pool. Here is how we are going to do it.

Everyone buys 'shares' in any team they want. Each share is $5 apiece. You h=
ave to spend a minimum of $20 to get in (let's pump the pool up). This will =
be done Friday, October 26. The payout formula has changed, however. It is n=
ow the following:

Winner of each game in the wildcard round and divisional round gets 5% of th=
e pot.
Winner of each conference championship gets 15% of the pot.
Winner of the Super Bowl gets 30% of the pot.

Since the Super Bowl winner wins earlier games to get to the Super Bowl, the=
y will end up with either 50% or 55%, depending on if they have to play in t=
he wildcard round.

The purpose of this is to establish some sort of value for 2nd tier teams. N=
ew Orleans, for example, may not have a chance (in your mind) as the Super B=
owl winner, but may get a payoff as a winner of a wildcard game, etc.

1) The pot will be established on Friday October 26. Nothing will be added t=
o it afterwards. The value of each team (as perceived by the market) can cha=
nge week to week, and by allowing people to 'pick' later, would dilute the e=
arnings, and de-incentivize people to make choices now, when it is riskier.
2) I will make my choice BEFORE any choices are sent to me. DO NOT send any =
choices to me today. You may start sending them tomorrow, and I will not loo=
k at them. I will NOT have prior information about which teams have small po=
ts and which ones have large ones. Obviously, that information could be usef=
ul.
3) After all choices have been made (by 4:00 PM Friday), I will send out a s=
ummary to everyone listing how much the pot is, which teams are picked and f=
or how much, how many outstanding shares there are. This information is to b=
e used to establish a market for bilateral trades. You may trade with whomev=
er you wish, how ever you wish. You can trade with people outside the pool. =
THIS IS YOUR OWN RISK.
All you have is a potential cash flow. You may trade those shares and cash f=
or other shares, for cash, etc; you may structure bilateral options, anythin=
g you want. But I have NOTHING to do with it, and it does not affect the pay=
out of the pool at the end. Figure your own hedges out. This can be fun.
4) In the unlikely event that a team wins a game(s) and establishes a payout=
 for cash, and no one owns shares in that team (ie - the Cardinals or someth=
ing), that money will be added to the Super Bowl winners pot. If the Super B=
owl is won by a nobody (very unlikely), we will have to establish a strategy=
 for that. I suggest one of 2 options - 1) Go down the list of Super Bowl lo=
ser, loser of conference Championship to Super Bowl winner, loser of confere=
nce Championship to Super Bowl loser, etc, until we find a winner, or donate=
 the money to charity for disaster relief. It's up to everyone.


So, let me know today that you are interested, but DO NOT send your picks an=
d money selection. That can start tomorrow, but I can't see the choices. Eit=
her call or email today, if possible!

Brad
