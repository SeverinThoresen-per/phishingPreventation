Good Morning Kim,

I rec'd the temporary password, etc to get into enron on line but unable to
access as we must have a firewall set up through our corporate data group.
So I need to ask you what is the most recent forecst cost for March Natural
Gas? also for April.

thanks,

p.s. "Happy Valentine's Day"

     Arnold Paxton
