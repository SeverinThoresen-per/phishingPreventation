Sally,

Someone brought up an interesting idea that might help motivate people and r=
etain them.  Recognizing that we are constrained from a cash perspective, do=
es it make any sense to still promote some people who deserve it so that at =
least they get recognition in terms of title and recognition by their peers,=
 however have their salary remain the same?

Just a thought.

Kevin
