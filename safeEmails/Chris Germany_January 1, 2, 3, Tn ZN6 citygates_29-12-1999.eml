Karen - All but S. Ct. and Boston Gas are good to nom.   Please let me know
k#'s.   Scott called me earlier and told me we are expecting a capacity piec=
e
of 1000 dth and we bought the remaining delivered.   Whom did we purchase th=
e
delivered from?   (I would like to call the supplier and give them the
breakdown so that I can get a contract number).

Noel - Also as per our earlier conversation, Yankee is giving me until 4:30
p.m. to turn in a contract # for their noms.   They are quoting their tariff=
=20
as
we have never turned our contract number in to them on time.    I need a
contract number for Tennesse and AGT for Yankee.   It is urgent.
