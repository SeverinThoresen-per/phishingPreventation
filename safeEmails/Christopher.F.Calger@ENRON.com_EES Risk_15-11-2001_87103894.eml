John,

Lots of stuff swirling around, but wanted to give you a few thoughts on me c=
oming to Houston, some business, some personal.

Business:
- Key functions and list of people?
- Immediate Priorities? fix stuff, minimize chaos, cost structure? project e=
xecution?=20
- Objectives for 2002 - what could this thing look like after 12 months? Sho=
uld we be in this business?  Do we price correctly?
- Reporting structure, book ownership, my relationship to you, Dave, etc., m=
anagement committee?
- Figuring out west power - Belden or other structure (I have not talked wit=
h him in the last few weeks)

Personal:
- Dealing with the risk of moving to Houston when Enron could still implode
- Mitigants: Bonus, retention stuff nailed down, prepaid relo or bridge loan
- Max relo package including buying house, house rental?, etc.
- Getting the family unit down there -=20

You have my complete loyalty and I obviously trust you, but these are extrao=
rdinary times.

Regards,

Chris
