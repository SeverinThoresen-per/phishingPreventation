Hello all, I just opened my email here in beautiful Aspen and read this.
Looks like he wrote it last night. Sorry to hear about this.

We are having a wonderful time here in one of your new houses. What a
beautiful house. Thank you so much for allowing us to do this. We will write
a formal thank you later. We hope to go for a bike ride today if weather
permits. Love. Bonnie with a rocky
 mountain high.
