George-

Here's the story.

Research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for JAVA=20
training by an outside person, weeklong classes for true Beginners and for=20
those with decent programming experience in other languages (esp C++). Vince=
=20
had pre-agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it. But, the response=20
they got was so "overwhelming" they reconsidered, for financial reasons, and=
=20
decided it would be better to just hire a Professor to teach a class for a=20
week here. The costs would be around $15,000, and there should be room for=20
around 15 people in the class. They have 6-8 people, and wonder if we might=20
have some people who would want to do it (a no-brainer- JAVA is a big-time=20
resume pad these days) and would be willing to share the costs with them.=20
What is your opinion on this? Personally, I think it's a relatively=20
inexpensive investment in our people, although, selfishly, it does increase=20
their 'market value' so to speak. (Of course, nothing keeps Directors from=20
going to the class as well :))
