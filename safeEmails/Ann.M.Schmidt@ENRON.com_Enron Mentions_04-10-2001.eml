LONDON -- BG Group PLC extended its reach in the Indian subcontinent and exp=
anded its exploration and production portfolio with the purchase of the offs=
hore Indian assets of U.S. energy group Enron Corp. for $388 million (422 mi=
llion euros).=20
Analysts applauded the purchase by the U.K. oil and gas company, saying it i=
s acquiring some promising assets inexpensively. The price works out to less=
 than $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent, given the proven and probable rese=
rves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of Enron Oil & Gas I=
ndia Ltd. "We value other Indian oil and gas reserves at $2.90 (assuming an =
oil price of $18), so BG appears to have paid a good price," said ABN Amro i=
n a research note.
A Bombay-based energy analyst reckoned Enron "probably undersold," noting th=
at earlier this year Indian state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., a partner o=
f Enron's Indian unit, had its $400 million offer for the assets rejected.=20
Enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in Indi=
a, and is attempting to exit the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's=
 largest private power plant, in which it has a 65% controlling stake.=20
The Indian unit's assets comprise a 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and the=
 Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, and a 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 explora=
tion license in the Gulf of Cambay off western India. The Enron unit is the =
designated operator of these developments.=20
Equity production from the fields amounts to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalen=
t a day, representing about 6% to 7% of BG's total output. For the year ende=
d March 31, Enron's Indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $60 mil=
lion on revenue of $160 million.=20
The acquisition complements BG's fledgling refining and marketing interests =
in India, which include holdings in western Indian distributors Gujarat Gas =
Co. (65%) and Mahanagar Gas (50%). It is also the driving force behind a pro=
ject to pipe liquefied natural gas from Iran to tap India's growing appetite=
 for gas.

NEW YORK -- As U.S. stocks staged their biggest rally since last spring, tec=
hnology stocks were leaders on hopes that the extended period of fundamental=
 deterioration might have begun to draw to a close.=20
Cisco Systems, which traded at a 52-week low just last week amid dismal expe=
ctations for sales and earnings, finished $2.47, or 22%, higher at $13.95 in=
 Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Other networking-products names also enjoyed some eye-catching gains. Extrem=
e Networks jumped 1.42, or 22%, to 7.84. Foundry Networks climbed 1.04, or 1=
6%, to 7.37. Ciena improved 2.52, or 27%, to 12.03. All trade on the Nasdaq.=
=20
The gains came after Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, told an audienc=
e at a broker-sponsored conference that the company felt comfortable with es=
timates for its earnings in the current quarter, which ends this month.=20
The Nasdaq Composite Index, sparked by the bulge in technology prices, shot =
up 88.48, or 5.93%, the index's biggest one-day improvement since the spring=
, and the fifth-sharpest improvement this year, as well as the 14th-best one=
-day advance ever. The index finished the session at 1580.81, which is just =
above where it closed Sept. 10, the day before the terrorists struck the U.S=
=2E=20
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which got a strong contribution from techn=
ology components like Microsoft and International Business Machines, climbed=
 173.19 points, or 1.93%. That was the ninth-sharpest one-day gain this year=
; the industrial average ended at 9123.78.=20
"There was a real nice tone to the market today," said Pat Davis, head of Na=
sdaq trading at UBS Warburg, said. "But I don't think you can say we've hear=
d all the bad news we're going to hear.=20
Over the past three weeks, Wall Street analysts had been systematically redu=
cing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in econo=
mic conditions. Only over the past several days had they begun to focus on v=
aluations, saying that, in some instances, stock prices looked attractive, e=
ven projecting weaker earnings.=20
Lehman Brothers, for example, jumped to the defense of some software names, =
and a number of those marked improvement. Shares of PeopleSoft gained 3.14, =
or 15%, to 23.68 on the Nasdaq, a 50% improvement over its Sept. 27 52-week =
low of 15.78. BMC Software added 74 cents, or 5.8%, to 13.60.=20
A number of storage-products makers marked sharp improvements, after Dain Ra=
uscher Wessels insisted high-quality names in the sector would be able to re=
alize earnings targets. McData, for example, rose 2.11, or 26%, to 10.15, wh=
ile QLogic shot up 5.89, or 33%, to 23.96, both on the Nasdaq.=20
Several other sectors of the market, including those that have suffered most=
 in the days since the attacks on Sept. 11, managed to mount recoveries. Sha=
res of Delta Air Lines gained 2.27, or 8.4%, to 29.36. Continental Airlines =
advanced 1.93, or 11%, to 19.32. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose =
1.45, or 7%, to 22.12.=20
Shares of several insurers moved higher on the prospects of higher rates. Ac=
e climbed 5.41, or 19%, to 34.31. Everest Re added 5.24, or 7.6%, to 73.80. =
XL Capital advanced 5.05, or 6.2%, to 86.45.=20
Nortel Networks wasn't punished for warnings that it would report a much wid=
er loss in the third quarter than analysts had been anticipating. Neverthele=
ss, the stock finished 25 cents higher, up 4.7%, at 5.54.=20
L-3 Communications added 4.22, or 4.7%, to 93.60, reaching a 52-week high. T=
he New York maker of defense communications products signed an agreement to =
acquire the Canadian aviation-services provider Spar Aerospace.=20
Sun Microsystems moved up 99 cents, or 12%, to 9 on the Nasdaq. The Palo Alt=
o, Calif., networking-products developer said it received a two-year, $100 m=
illion sourcing pact from News Corp.=20
Qwest Communications, which slumped to a 52-week low Tuesday, gained 1.60, o=
r 10%, to 17.20. CIBC World Markets talked up the stock, citing its valuatio=
n.=20
Eli Lilly fell 3.62, or 4.4%, to 79.25. The drug maker warned that sales of =
its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac have eroded faster than expected after=
 it lost its patent protection two months ago.=20
Shares of several independent energy marketers moved higher, helped by comme=
nts from Salomon Smith Barney, which said the recent selloff in the group le=
ft the stocks at attractive valuations. Enron gained 2.88, or 9.4%, to 33.49=
, Dynegy added 1.66, or 4.3%, to 39.96, and Duke Energy gained 37 cents, or =
0.9%, to 39.60.=20
Best Buy rose 3.70, or 9.2%, to 48.80 in what proved a strong session for re=

Enron to sell assets in oil, gas off India=20
BG Group pays $388 million; power plant is still on market=20
By MICHAEL DAVIS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
British natural gas company BG Group has struck a deal to buy Enron Corp.'s =
offshore oil and natural gas properties in India for $388 million in cash, t=
he companies said Wednesday.=20
These properties are the last of the oil- and gas-producing properties Houst=
on-based Enron retained after it spun off Enron Oil & Gas, now named EOG Res=
ources.=20
The deal marks another step for Houston-based Enron away from owning large p=
hysical assets. The company wants to focus on trading and making markets in =
a variety of commodities.=20
It is "another significant step for Enron in selling assets not integrated i=
nto its wholesale or retail energy businesses," the company said in a writte=
n statement.=20
Enron's other assets for sale in India include the controversial Dabhol Powe=
r Project, India's largest private power plant, in which Enron holds a 65 pe=
rcent controlling stake.=20
Reports surfaced Wednesday that Enron might be willing to sell its stake in =
the $3 billion project at a discount. Analysts have said for months now that=
 Enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer wi=
lling to make the right offer. Tata Power Co., India's largest private elect=
ricity firm, has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over Dabhol=
=2E=20
The oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the Tap=
ti natural gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles =
northwest of Mumbai and a 62.6 percent interest in the offshore block CB-OS/=
1 exploration license. All are on the west coast of India.=20
Production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8,200 b=
arrels of oil per day. Reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million=
 barrels of oil equivalent. BG paid about $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent=
=2E=20
The other partners in the Tapti and Panna/Mukta offshore operations are Oil =
and Natural Gas Corp., which holds 40 percent, and Reliance Industries, with=
 a 30 percent stake. The other partners in the CB-OS/1 license are Hindustan=
 Oil Exploration Co., with 17.36 percent, Tata Petrodyne with 10 percent, an=
d Oil and Natural Gas Corp. with 10 percent.=20
Enron acquired its natural gas reserves in India with an eye to using them a=
s fuel in the Dabhol plant.=20
In August, Houston-based Enron said it and its other foreign partners were r=
eady to sell their stakes in Dabhol for no less than $1 billion, an amount e=
stimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial inv=
estment in the project.=20
Dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and paym=
ent defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. =
It was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on India's west coast in J=
une after the board stopped buying power.=20
John Ambler, Enron spokesman, would not comment specifically on any possible=
 negotiations to sell the Dabhol project, but said the company favors sellin=
g its stake.=20
"We continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this=
 issue is for the government of India and/or Indian financial institutions t=
o acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant," Ambler said. "We are conti=
nuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase =
agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs."=20
The shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and w=
ould have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2,184 megawatts.=20
Other partners in Dabhol include General Electric and the Bechtel constructi=
on firm, which each own 10 percent.=20
The remaining 15 percent is held by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,=
 the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plan=
t is located.=20
BG's existing interests in India include holdings in western Indian natural =
gas distributors Gujarat Gas Co. and Mahanagar Gas. The company is also work=

Edison rates to remain high under utility's deal with state
By KAREN GAUDETTE
Associated Press Writer

10/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Consumer advocates warn that Southern California Edison=
 customers, already saddled with last spring's record rate increase until 20=
03, could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead.=20
The deal secretly negotiated with the state Public Utilities Commission this=
 week settles a lawsuit filed by Edison last November and is designed to kee=
p the utility from following Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest u=
tility, into bankruptcy.
It lets Edison pay off more than $3 billion of a $3.9 billion debt, in part =
by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for a=
t least the next two years.=20
Consumer advocates, however, said Wednesday that other consequences of the s=
tate's power crisis could send rates higher still.=20
The state's power-buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money i=
t needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollar=
s it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $43 billion=
 of long-term power already contracted for delivery.=20
The prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even mo=
re price hikes in the future dismayed some Edison customers.=20
"We can't stay in business," said William Ho, general manager of Top Hat Cle=
aners in West Hollywood, where the monthly electric bill has gone from $600 =
before the state's energy crisis to nearly $1,200. "We would have to raise p=
rices, and we're already heading into a recession."=20
Ho said Top Hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off dis=
play lights in the windows. But he added, "You can't press clothes in the da=
rk."=20
It's unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribut=
e without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in pow=
er-buying costs, said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform =
Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group.=20
Hoge and other consumer advocates said this week's deal amounts to a ratepay=
er bailout of Edison, which supported the state's failed deregulation plan.=20
"It's like saying I'm not going to beat you any harder, so it shouldn't hurt=
," she said.=20
John Bryson, Edison International president and chief executive officer, sai=
d the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay it=
s creditors.=20
Edison owes nearly $4 billion to hundreds of power companies, ranging from e=
nergy marketing giant Enron Corp. to the state Independent System Operator, =
manager of the state's power grid.=20
"The agreement means stability, predictability," he said during a conference=
 call with reporters Wednesday. "It means preserving and enhancing the infra=
structure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work."=20
The PUC said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its =
role as a power-buyer. Commission President Loretta Lynch said the agency ha=
d little choice in figuring a way to let Edison repay its debts and avoid ba=
nkruptcy.=20
"I think that this is a balanced compromise, but clearly it does allow ratep=
ayers to pay off some of the back debt," she said.=20
The state Department of Water Resources so far has spent $9 billion buying e=
lectricity for customers of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Die=
go Gas and Electric Co.=20
The shareholder-owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass=
 along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers. The state's 1996 d=
eregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers.=20
That price cap was the focal point of Edison's lawsuit against the PUC, with=
 the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from p=
assing the cost of energy to its customers.=20
Under the deal struck this week, Edison also must direct its available cash =
and an estimated $1.2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends =
toward paying its debt. The utility could be due refunds ordered by federal =
energy regulators, and that money also would have to help pay down the debt.=
=20
The agreement now goes before U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in L=
os Angeles, who could rule on it this week.=20
"Right now Judge Lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers. ... Will he=
 pull out $3.3 billion for Edison or will he protect the working men and wom=
en of California who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax?" sai=
d Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consu=
mer Rights, which organized a protest rally Wednesday outside the federal co=
urthouse in Los Angeles.=20
Heller estimated the settlement could cost Edison ratepayers $750 each over =
the next four years.=20

BG IS TO BUY Enron's oil and gas assets off India's west coast for $388m (po=
unds 263m) in a move that will make the UK-based oil and gas producer the la=
rgest foreign investor in the country's upstream energy market.=20
The deal will add 5 per cent to BG's total output, with 19,000 barrels of oi=
l equivalent a day, of which 60 per cent is gas. According to David McManus,=
 BG's executive vice president, it will be earnings accretive from day one. =
"There is currently a deficit between the supply of gas, which is currently =
all indigenous gas, and the need for gas within India," Mr McManus said.
Some analysts see demand doubling over the next 10 years, making India one o=
f the world's fastest-growing energy markets.=20
The assets being sold by the US group Enron include a 30 per cent stake in t=
he Tapti field and the Panna Mukta field north-west of Bombay.=20
BG shares closed down 2.5p at 261p in a mixed oil sector after the news. Mar=
k Redway, an analyst at Teather & Greenwood, said: "The logic is good and th=
ey're paying quite a low multiple at six or seven times last year's earnings=
, but [after the 11 September attacks in the US] there's a lot of investor n=
ervousness at the moment over exposure to this part of the world."

NEW DELHI, Oct. 3. BG India has entered into a conditional agreement to acqu=
ire Enron's offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $388 mi=
llion.=20
The contract signed on Tuesday night with Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd involv=
es purchase of the latter's 30 per cent stake in the Tapti gas field and the=
 Panna-Mukta gas/oil fields besides the 62.64 per cent interest in the CB-OS=
/1 exploration block.
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr Nigel Shaw, BG India Chi=
ef Executive Officer, said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeho=
lders agreeing to BG as the operator of the exploration fields.=20
The rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of Oil a=
nd Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a 40 per cent stakeholder in the Panna-Mu=
kta, Tapti fields, besides a 10 per cent stake in the CB-OS/1 exploration bl=
ock, seeking operatorship of the fields.=20
When contacted, the ONGC Chairman, Mr Subir Raha, said, "ONGC's position rem=
ains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields. We a=
re currently in talks with BG on the issue."=20
"We are in talks with the Government as well as ONGC on the issue. We are no=
t contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied,"=20
Mr Shaw replied when queried on the issue. He stressed that in case the othe=
r parties do not agree, the deal will fall through. "We will walk away in su=
ch an event," he said.=20
On the legality of ONGC's claim, Mr Shaw said, "under the agreement, at the =
point of change of control (from Enron to BG), the other stakeholders can ob=
ject to the transfer of operatorship (to BG). However, the contract is not c=
lear on the deadlock."=20
Mr Shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end =
of the month.=20
Currently, in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, Reliance Industries Ltd =
holds 30 per cent stake while ONGC holds 40 per cent equity. In the case of =
the CB-OS/1 exploration field, Hindustan Oil and Exploration Company holds 1=
7.36 per cent, Tata Petrodyne 10 per cent and ONGC 10 per cent.=20
The BG vision: BG plans to double the gas production capacity of the Tapti g=
as fields by 2004, according to Mr Shaw. Though not willing to reveal the qu=
antum of investment in the future, he said that BG would be committed to its=
 share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on CB-=
OS/1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in December.=20
"There is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of th=
e frustrations has been the lack of this."=20
BG will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with Gas Authority of In=
dia Ltd (GAIL) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of=
 the asset (exploration field). However, the venture will be free to find ne=
w markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields. Current=
ly, the fields yield 70 million standard cu.feet of gas per day and 8,200 ba=
rrels of oil per day.=20
BG has a 50 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd, a gas supply company in Mum=
bai. Further, it is in the process of setting up an LNG regassification term=
inal in Pipavav.=20
BG is not interested in buying out Enron's upcoming LNG regassification faci=
lity at Dabhol since it is setting up its own LNG regassification terminal a=
t Pipavav, Gujarat, Mr Shaw said.=20
Mr Shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery=
 from the domestic fields, there would not be any conflict of interest betwe=
en the gas sold from the LNG terminal and that from the exploration fields.=20
On the pricing front, the Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields enjoy a fixed price c=
ontract till 2004. Beyond this period, the pricing is internationally linked=
=2E=20
Once the deal is completed, BG India plans to initiate talks with Reliance I=
ndustries Ltd (RIL) and ONGC to second their personnel at the operating leve=
l of the exploration venture, according to Mr Shaw.=20
Further, it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in London a=
s well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum.=
=20
BG has so far invested $150 million in its ventures in the country.=20

British Gas to buy Enron's oil, gas assets for $388 m

British Gas India today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy th=
e assets of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd for $388 million. The assets include a=
 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas=
 fields as well as a 62.64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the CB-=
OS/1 block. All three are located on the west coast of India and are operate=
d by Enron.=20
However, British Gas India chief executive officer Nigel Shaw said the deal =
is subject to the condition that British Gas gets operational control of the=
 fields. "If we are not the operator, we will walk away from the deal," he s=
aid. The deal, signed in London last night, would require clearance from the=
 Indian government. Shaw revealed that British Gas India has already initiat=
ed a dialogue with the government for this.
But the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it ha=
s dried. The state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has a 40=
 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of =
the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by Enron Oil & Gas.=20
However, petroleum minister Ram Naik said "all issues will be sorted out in =
due course". "Enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal. We will exa=
mine the issue," he said.=20
According to oil industry sources, the operatorship is based on a consensus_=
and not on the percentage of shares held_among shareholders. The proposed sa=
le of Enron's assets does not "mean an automatic transfer of operatorship an=
d the shareholders will have to come to a consensus," ONGC sources claim.=20
What is more, ONGC had earlier unsuccessfully bid $350 million for Enron's o=
il and gas assets. ONGC has the first right of refusal, according to an ONGC=
 official. ONGC chairman S Raha was unavailable for comment.=20
Shaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not=
 lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of op=
erating the oil and gas fields.=20
"We are in active discussion with both ONGC and Reliance. We are hopeful of =
wrapping it up by the end of this month," Shaw said.=20
An ONGC official, however, said the state-owned company was aware of the dev=
elopment but had not been informed officially by Enron.=20
Shaw also disclosed that British Gas was willing to make further investments=
 to ramp up production at the Tapti and the Panna/Mukta fields.=20
"Further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree. We a=
re looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004," he said.=20
When asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise, Shaw =
said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars.=20
The three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meter=
s of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil a day.=20
An Enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a =
Reliance spokesman.=20
Enron Oil & Gas has 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas and Panna/Mukta oi=
l and gas field, ONGC has a 40 per cent interest and Reliance has the remain=
ing 30 per cent.=20
In the case of CB-OS/1, the other partners are Hindustan Oil Exploration Com=
pany with 17.36 per cent and Tata Petrodyne and ONGC with 10 per cent each.
