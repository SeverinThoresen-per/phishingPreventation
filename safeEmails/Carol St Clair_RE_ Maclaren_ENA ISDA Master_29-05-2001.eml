Hi Stephanie,

Maclaren doesn't have an entity which can act as a process agent in the US.
How about this as a suggestion:

"(c) Process Agent.  For the purpose of section 13(c) of this Agreement:

Process Agent for Party A shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party A at
such address.

Process Agent for Party B shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party B at
such address.

For purposes of this Part 4(b), a "senior officer" shall be any officer of
such party with a title of vice president or higher."

Regards,
Michael

Michael,
Attached for your review are clean and blacklined copies of the ISDA Master
Agreement.  Also attached is a proposed Amendment to the Enron Corp.
Guaranty.  If the attached meet with your approval, we will proceed with
the execution copies (pending completion of the Process Agent info).

I have asked Maclaren for one in NY, and will get back to you.  Do you have
a Process Agent in Quebec, as it doesn't help Maclaren that yours is in
Washington?

As I understand it, there are no outstanding issues - the credit issues
have
been resolved (I guess you have received this update since you are
preparing
the final drafts).  Once we clear the Process Agent point, the documents
can
be executed.

Regards,
Michael

Mike,

Can you supply me with the Process Agent information for Maclaren?  We are
preparing a final draft of the ISDA Master Agreement.
