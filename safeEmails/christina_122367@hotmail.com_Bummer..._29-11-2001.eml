sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?  I still plan on coming=20
into the office tomorrow.  Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out=20
and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!  (keeping=20
my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?  Maybe we=20
should do it downtown somewhere.  Comedy works first then dancing?  Keep=20
your chin up you handsome devil!
