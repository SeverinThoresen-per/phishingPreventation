At the end of my 3:00 meeting with Philippe and Greg today I will get clarif=
ication about the international travel.  It is hard for me to believe that P=
hilippe or Beth Perlman or Greg Piper will fly coach to London.  I will keep=
 you posted.  -Sally=20

I assume this (number 8)  coach class international travel does not apply to=

Also, what about London travel?
