I will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the se=
verance plan has not been adopted by all Enron entities domestically.  Simil=
arly, some Enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, =
etc.  So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications. =
 I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue.  Michelle

Attached is the latest draft of a memo outlining the changes to severance, v=
acation, et al.  While I know that we don't have a decision on severance, Mi=
chelle Cash and I have discussed most likely only being able to include a li=
nk to the restated plan.  If we do that, any language in the memo related to=
 severance will be very generic.  I've also added information about the susp=
ension of the Educational Assistance Program.  (Q: Rick, is the cut off date=
 Nov. 2002, or should it be 2001?)  Let me know your thoughts when possible.=
  We'd like to send this as soon as we get word from David that a plan has b=
een selected.

Michelle, when we know which plan is selected, we'd still like to have some =
summary language/talking points we can provide HR generalists and supervisor=
s to help them briefly explain the plan as they are talking with employees.
