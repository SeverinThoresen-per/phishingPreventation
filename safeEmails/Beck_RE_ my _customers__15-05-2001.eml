Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.  We can talk about ho=
w the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide i=
nfo to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.  W=
e will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.  --Sally=20

   I put some review customers in the system.  Don't feel all that great abo=
ut them, (from a commercial feedback standpoint)  Wondered if you feel these=
 are appropriate.  We may not hear from some of these people -- but it is wo=
rth a shot.

I am open to any suggesions you have

Beth
