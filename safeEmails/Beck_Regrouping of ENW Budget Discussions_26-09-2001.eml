Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling di=
scussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most se=
nse.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan=
 meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holi=
day, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to =
make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of da=
te, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and atten=
dees as follows:=20
