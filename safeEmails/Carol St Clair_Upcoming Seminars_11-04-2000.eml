I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference=20
room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May=20
25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something u=

with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we=20
plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global=20
contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what t=
o=20
do with the credit group.

Carol
