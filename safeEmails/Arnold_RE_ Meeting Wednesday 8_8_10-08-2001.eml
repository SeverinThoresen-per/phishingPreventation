John,
Thank you very much for your time Wednesday afternoon ,we appreciate it. You=
r feedback is very important to us as we continue to define the end product.=
 As discussed we too only see the value in the product  if we have mutiple "=
customers" participating and as I told you we have had many hedge funds and =
CTA's request a similar service. Over the next 2/3 weeks we will be presenti=
ng to a number of these interested parties and would be happy to keep you up=
dated on progress. I anticipate more aggressive "marketing" of the product f=
rom September onwards as we are still stuck in the summer vacation schedule =
and it is making serious "roadshowing" difficult.
Again thank you for your time and please dont hesitate to contact me with an=
y questions you may have or any further feedback you may want to provide (ei=
ther to Deutsche or Campbell ).
Regards,
Kevin
