Yep, I actually got in around 7:45 and it has been a very productive day.  I
am leaving here in about 10 minutes and I should be back around 2:00.  Cuts
off a big portion of my day.  I am hoping that I will not have to stay too
late tonight.

I have been kicking butt...but not bothering with the names.  Are they reall=
y
that important?  Ha!

How is your day going?
