For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additiona=
l 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3r=
d.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA=
 for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy
