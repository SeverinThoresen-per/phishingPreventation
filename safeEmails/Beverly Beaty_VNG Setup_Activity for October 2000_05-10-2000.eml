FYI ....

There were some minor problems with the setup of VNG on Transco, but they=20
have all been addressed
and corrected. =20

I have been in contact with Judy Hall at Transco and  Ellen Ingmire at=20
Williams and have fixed the following
issues:

10/1 VNG short 1712 at Emporia, ENA transport  RESOLUTION:  Transco pulled i=
n=20
a retro nom that was in Transit
 from the weekend that I sent from home.  It was overlooked in the confusion=
=20
by Transco.

10/2 No issues

10/3 No issues

10/4  After several attempts to load by Transco, we cut our transport by 1 d=
t=20
in zone 45 to allow room for FS to
 be scheduled.  We were overlapping entitlements.

10/5  All noms resent for ID 2 to correct any entitlement issues from 10/4=20
late due to system downtime in Unify and Sitara.

For your information, the breakdown of telescoped capacity is as follows:

Total Capacity:  35,930

 ENA   WILLIAMS
Z1 3400   2708
Z2 5000   3983
Z3 11600   9239

I spoke with Ellen at Williams and she is going to e-mail me each morning=20
with the volumes and/or zones she will be=20
nominating from in order for us not to overnominate the total entitlements=20
per zones.  This should be baseloaded for
the most part and further changes should not occur.

I apologize for the inconvenience any of this may have caused for VNG.  We=20
will remain on top of this issue throughout
the remainder of the deal.  I personally will make sure all of the Transco=20
issues remain resolved so this will not happen
in the future.

Thanks for your patience during this time of confusion.

Bev Beaty
