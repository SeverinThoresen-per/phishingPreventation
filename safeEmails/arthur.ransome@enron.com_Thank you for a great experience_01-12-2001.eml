Dear Ken,

Today I learned that effective midnight tonight I have been made redundant f=
rom my position in Enron Europe. I have worked for Enron for the last 10 yea=
rs and I can say that despite what has happened today, joining Enron was the=
 best career move I made. The past 10 years have presented opportunities tha=
t were beyond my wildest dreams. I appreciate everything that Enron has done=
 for myself and my family, and I leave believing that I did my best to retur=
n my gratefulness in some way. While growing up in a worling class environme=
nt my father taught me two great lessons in life, which I believe we all nee=
d to learn. The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you =
had better work for it. The second being that you should never understand th=
e meaning of the word "can't". I believe that I have been able to follow his=
 teaching in my career with Enron.

I leave Enron with tremendous experience and, most of all a feeling of belon=
ging to something that was once great. I truly believed in the company and i=
ts people. Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that =
Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangi=
ble assets. Enron's greatness was built by its people because we all have dr=
eams and ambitions to be a part of something great. Although I leave the com=
pany with great sadness I also leave with a great feeling of thanks and appr=
eciation.
