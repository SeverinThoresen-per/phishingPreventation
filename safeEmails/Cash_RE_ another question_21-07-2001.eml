Michelle,
I have run across a few agreements where the employee has signed the agreeme=
nt but not dated it.  Is this something that could potentially be a problem?
I think that, for our (exec comp) purposes, the agreement is not actually in=
 effect until it is signed by the person "offering" the terms.  Is this true=
?
Thank you

Dana
