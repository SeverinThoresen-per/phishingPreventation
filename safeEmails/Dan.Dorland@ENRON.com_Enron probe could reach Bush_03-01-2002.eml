Enron probe could reach Bush=20
Backed campaign: Senate committee to focus on directors' role, partnerships
Reuters, with files from The Associated Press=20
WASHINGTON - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faces further scrutiny on Capit=
ol Hill with another committee announcing yesterday it would probe the compa=
ny's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White H=
ouse.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on invest=
igations will subpoena documents next week and hold a hearing on Jan. 24.
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the larges=
t bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival D=
ynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who chairs the full government affairs committee, did=
 not rule out looking into connections between Enron and the administration =
of George W. Bush.
Enron was a major backer of President Bush's election campaign. "There are s=
ome interconnections here with the Bush administration, but that is not the =
focus of this investigation," said Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat.
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said the=
 investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse;=
 accounting firm Andersen, which audited Enron's financial statements; and t=
he company's use of complex financial partnerships.
Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by at least five co=
ngressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion and the departments of Justice and Labor.
Reports recently emerged that a week before filing for bankruptcy protection=
, Enron contributed US$100,000 to Democrats after giving nearly all its prio=
r donations this year to Republicans.
The money went to the organization that aids Senate Democratic candidates, b=
ut a recently hired attorney for Enron insisted the donations were unrelated=
 to congressional investigations.
Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented former president Bill Clinton and o=
ther high-profile clients, said the money was pledged months before Enron's =
collapse prompted the congressional inquiries. Rather, he said, the shift re=
flected the Democrats taking control of the Senate this year.
"Donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are follow=
ed by all major corporations," Mr. Bennett said yesterday about Enron's US$5=
0,000 cheques on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign C=
ommittee.
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock cl=
osed at US63=A2, up US3=A2 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday -- off f=
rom an August, 2000, high of US$90.56.
Thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and much of their retireme=
nt savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependen=
t on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month whe=
n employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock pric=
e plunged.
In other developments yesterday, Enron bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzalez put =
off ruling on whether to compel Jeffrey McMahon, Enron chief financial offic=
er, to testify about why the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in New =
York rather than Houston.
Dynegy and other unsecured creditors want Mr. McMahon to give deposition tes=
timony on Enron's choice of venue for the bankruptcy filing. They've asked J=
udge Gonzalez to transfer the largest bankruptcy case ever to Houston, where=
 Enron is based.
Enron opposes the request to order Mr. McMahon's testimony, calling it "unne=
cessary, unduly burdensome, and disruptive."
"Courts have repeatedly recognized that demands for depositions of high-rank=
ing corporate officers are often misused as a tool of harassment and should =
not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information," En=
ron said in a motion filed Monday seeking to quash the request.
