Dear Rick:

Just a quick followup to my voice mail of earlier this afternoon---

I represent an Executive Search Firm based in Atlanta and have been retained=
 by an international leader in the energy industry to pursue Director-level =
talent; as it happens, my client has recently indicated an express interest =
in speaking with you.  Since I'd imagine you've been inundated with calls an=
d e-mails similar to mine, in an effort to eliminate any confusion I should =
tell you that we tried to contact you yesterday (my associate, Michael Allen=
, left you a voice mail).

I understand that the environment at Enron must be a challenging one at this=
 point; however, if you're interested in talking/listening and are in a posi=
tion to take a short break, the President/COO of my client company is in Hou=
ston today and is curious as to whether you'd by some remote chance be free =
this afternoon or evening for a brief chat.  I realize that this is highly u=
northodox, but also feel that standing on ceremony is perhaps not always the=
 most prudent approach.

I'll wait to hear from you in regard to your interest level---and if you're =
not available today (as I'm assuming to be the case), we can obviously resch=
edule for a time that's a bit more reasonable.  Thanks---

Sincerely,

Marcy Brinegar
