John:
I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send=20
you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly=20
that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are=20
between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be=20
issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party=
=20
has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics=20
need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these=20
mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for=20
some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward t=
o=20
hearing from you.

> L/C provisions and Format (Exhibit A and Schedule 1)
> Legal requests that we include neither the LC Provisions nor Schedule 1 as
> Annexs to this ISDA.   Banks tend to have their own  formats, and should
> we ever change banks, we may not be able to comply with this provision if
> the bank is noncoooerative, thus causing us to violate the ISDA.  Instead,
> we would prefer that should margin be called and an LC is issued, that the
> format descrepancies, if any, be ironed out at that time.
