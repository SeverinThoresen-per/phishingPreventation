Calling it an error is unfair.  I am not prepared to offer her AND her husba=
nd a job by Friday.  She concedes that her role on the power side may be pro=
ject-like and therefore short-term.  I will keep in touch with her and open =
the door later.  London is being freaky about people finding homes ASAP, and=
 it doesn't match my timeframe.

As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meetin=
g. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's n=
ote, we are going in on Monday.

I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in th=
e organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita. =20

Thanks

Louise

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your bu=
dget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assu=
ming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're p=
utting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an an=
swer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any othe=
r candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in=
 touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she s=
till wants to come to Houston.

Brad
