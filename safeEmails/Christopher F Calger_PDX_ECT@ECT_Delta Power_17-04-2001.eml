Louise,

The lawyers are turning docs and expect to have the escrow account set up an=

ld us they will fund this week.  I was speaking with Dean Vanech on a separa=
te deal and he matter-of-factly said that he thought that we were done on th=
e turbines, just wrapping up the paperwork.  I will let you know if (i) anyt=
hing changes or (ii) the $ shows up.

Regards,

Chris
