	Charlie, let me try calling Delaine in the morning and ask her who is next
	in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue.  Let's see what
	kind of a response I get.  If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley
	may need to call.  I will let you know.  Thanks. Lynn

Do you want to contact Delaine or should I.  In light of Stan & Dave Neubaue=
r's, "get disputes on the table and settled quickly" direction I believe we =
need to bump this up a notch!  Should Mike Nelson or Shelly Corman call/writ=
e Greg Phillips?

Charlie
