Ed:
We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit=20
points with them:

1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.

2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light=20
and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.

3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.

4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a=20
creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee o=
r=20
its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses=20
(ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occu=
r=20
as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic=20
creditworthiness test.

I look forward to hearing from you. =20
