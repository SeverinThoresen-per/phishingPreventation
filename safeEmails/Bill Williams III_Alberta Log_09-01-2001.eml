Group,

Please use the Alberta Phone Log next to the PX trade app.  We need to recor=
d=20
the exact time and instructions from each separate conversation.  After=20
writing it down, please transfer your notes to the alberta power dispatch lo=
g=20
on their web site.  This log can be found at http://albertapower
Go to the admin tab, and use the dispatch log portion (this site is very=20
similar to the California Daily book site).  Like everything else, the more=20
detail the better.

Also, we need to make sure that mws are in the "merit order" before we=20
dispatch them.  So if Transalta offers us 5 mws, we only want to take those=20
if all 353 mws of ours are dispatched.  Otherwise we are not going to have=20
the pool taking our mws at the final bid price, and we will not be maximizin=
g=20
the value of our unit.

IF you have questions, and you should, please see me, Ryan or Monica.  I am=20
always available for phone calls and will explain whatever you may not have=20
picked up from the various emails or manual in your box.

Bill
