Three cheers for our neighbor, Brad Odom, who has successfully negotiated th=
e removal of the 18,000 sofas and other junk that had piled up next to the b=
uilding at the corner of Hopkins and Fairview!

This Saturday morning, Brad, and volunteers (anyone who wants to help - brin=
g your shovel and come along) will be landscaping the area, with funds donat=
ed by the owner of the property.  The landscaping is being done in an effort=
 to discourage future dumpings in this spot.

Over and above the call of duty - these are East Montrose residents!
