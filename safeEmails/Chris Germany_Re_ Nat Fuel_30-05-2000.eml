Chris, I have researched the buy and sell from/to AEC Marketing for 4/2000. =
=20
Here are the details:

Location:  7126-NFUL/TRCO LEIDY TRANSCO

  transport demand charge(4/2000)    =3D $56,078.82


Deal   227196 purchase 9189/day @ NX1 + .22 (3.12)   =20

Deal  219618 sell              6000/day @ Michcon Citygate G.D. M.I. +=20
=2E39(3.39)=20

It seems as though ENA is recouping the demand charge only on 6,000 mmbtu pe=
r=20
day.  Do you know if the additional reimbursement has been locked in? =20
Perhaps on the financial side?        =20
