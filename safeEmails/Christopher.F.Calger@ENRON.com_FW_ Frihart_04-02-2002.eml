I have had discussions with Bryant.  He was disappointed as to the reduction=
 in the equity because as he says "he is in this for the long run". However,=
 I can get him done at current structure if move 50/50 to 55/55.  Is that po=
ssible ? That adds a total of $10 k over a 2 year period with 50% cash ($500=
0) in the first year and 50% equity ($5000) in the back.  Seems like it shou=
ld not be a deal breaker.=20
