Subject: Deal Changes - Add Comments

Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section=20
of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make=
=20
big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of=20
course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in=20
case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Hello

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in=20
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to=
=20
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed=20
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when=20
we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Melissa
