David:
Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which=20
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern=20
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and =
I=20
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want=20
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't=20
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a=20
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a=20
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.


Thanks
David

How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the=20
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which=20
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritiz=
e=20
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we=20
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financia=
l=20
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next. =20
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated=
=20
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which=20
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Regards--VE
