I am talking to GFI for North America.  GFI originally called us concerning =
Europe but backed down and didnt want to pay. I will ask again if they want =
Europe.=20

Natsource Europe is in contract discussions with us for Europe and UK Gas an=
d Power.  They asked us to throw in coal and the coal group said no.  I have=
 tried to get them to change their position as this will add liquidity.  Ask=
 them why they do not want Natsource. They pay nothing for executions by Nat=
source.=20

TFS has not been contacted concerning Europe.  Feel free to contact them and=
 try to get a deal.  Call me to discuss.=20

According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expres=
sed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspe=
ctive, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Thanks,
Paul=20
