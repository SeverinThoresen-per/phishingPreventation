Hey,

I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting,=
 from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had you=
r email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return =
email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.

We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole t=
hing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative ret=
urns in the future!


So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B=
&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you hav=
ing some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie=
 or grab  supper some time.=20

Take care,

Don
