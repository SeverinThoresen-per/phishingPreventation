Sue:
Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's=20
baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do,=20
things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that=
=20
I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.

Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we go=
t=20
the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so=
=20
I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am=
=20
still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a=20
few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm=20
trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here=
=20
at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will=20
help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch. =20
Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few=20
weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time=
=20
off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being=20
uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is=
=20
good practice for when the baby comes.

Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger=20
pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is=20
still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team whic=
h=20
we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically ever=
y=20
day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping=
=20
that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on=20
cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for =
a=20
week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the=20
possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see=
=20
how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby=
=20
is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at an=
y=20
time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in=20
august.  Let me know what you think.

How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do yo=
u=20
want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either somethin=
g=20
on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.

What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying=
=20
what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I a=
m=20
going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the=
=20
rest of the year off.

I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to=20
catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

Carol
