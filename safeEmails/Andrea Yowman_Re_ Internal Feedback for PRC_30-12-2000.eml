Subject: Internal Feedback for PRC

I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent=20
Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names tha=
t=20
you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice=20
mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I=20
thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP. =20
Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to kno=
w=20
that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for=
=20
me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe=
=20
me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP=
=20
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally=20
