Cara,
I was out Friday, but totally agree on segregation of East and West Confirma=
tions.  Also, I agree that there needs to be a method to delete confirmation=
 records (either for mistakes on date, path changes requiring it, etc).  I d=
idn't get any records to go to the confirmation table on Thursday, so I'll l=
ook at the information on the transmission cells uploaded today.

I don't think repeating some of the errors we find is too big of a problem.

CB

Good Afternoon Everyone


PreSchedule Workspace:

I started uploading schedules last evening from the PSW to the Path Confirm =
Dbase.  The COB sheet took 1 hour and 12 minutes to run 40 lines, still arou=
nd 2 minutes per line.  This is an improvement, still slow for usefulness in=
 production.

I experimented with putting the transmission in the E column, to see if it w=
ill represent in the path or if it will blow up the app. The result of that =
was that it ran the lines and totally ignored anything extra in the E cell.=20



Path Confirmation:

We will need to automatically make sure that only East users see East Schedu=
les and West users see West Schedules.  I cannot comprehend the nightmare of=
 problems we will run into if we are not completely segregated.

If I run lines into the wrong date, or for some other reason need to delete =
entire records, how do I do that? I assure you this will happen.

*Something seems to have changed in the transmission cell uploading, Any inf=
ormation I put in the first set of Transmission cells is ignored. (Trans1 Na=
me, Trans1 deal, Trans 1 oasis).


That's all I am going to do for now,  we can pick things up again on Monday.=
  Do you think it would be good to do a quick rundown of what has been ident=
ified and what has been corrected ? I am worried that my testing might have =
to be repeated on some of the same items due to the volume of e-mails.

Thanks,

Cara
