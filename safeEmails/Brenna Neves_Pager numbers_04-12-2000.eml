In case you all don't already have this, Pete gave me the rotating pager=20
number for his group.  Hopefully this will enable us to get in contact with=20
someone on a weekend if the need arises.

713-515-1826.

I would only use this number on the weekends as we SHOULD be able to contact=
=20
someone during the week.

Thanks!

Brenna
