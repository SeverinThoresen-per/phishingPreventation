Janet:
I left my comments in your chair.  I think that we need to decide how these=20
provisions work with Article 8 of the EEI Master, particularly Sections=20
8.1(c), 8.2(c),  and 8.3.  My vote would be to replace the language in the=20
EEI master with the provisions that you drafted so that everything is in one=
=20
place.      Let me know what you think.
