	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ tota=
l?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also=
 in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and o=
utlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can=
=20
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet. =20

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are=
 identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had=
 anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Tha=
nks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ=20

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) =
to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from =
the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a recei=
pt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract =
with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the B=
ushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overr=
un (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt poi=
nt to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or ma=
ybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not ge=
tting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transact=
ion--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.
Ranelle

Subject:	Questions on MDQ=20

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and=
 see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question. =20

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do =
not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contrac=
t
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract =3D Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ.=20
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated =
on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the sh=
ipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything o=
ver will be=20
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
