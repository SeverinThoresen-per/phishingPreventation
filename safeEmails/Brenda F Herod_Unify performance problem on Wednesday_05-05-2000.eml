Subject: Unify performance problem on Wednesday

As you are aware, the Unify system experienced significant performance=20
problems Wednesday from approx 9:30 am - 11:20 am.  The duration of the=20
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before. =
=20
The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinkin=
g=20
that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve=20
performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was=
=20
actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to "bounce" the server=20
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.

The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a=20
particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an=20
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in=20
the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have=20
contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the=20
behavior is a "feature" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types=20
of changes at night during scheduled outages.

I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this=20
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.=
 =20
If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a=
=20
call.
