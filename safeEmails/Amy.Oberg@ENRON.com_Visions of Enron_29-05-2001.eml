Dear Mr. Skilling:

As part of Enron's Imagine the Future Day (4/24/01), a group of Ernonite's v=
oluntarily got together under the tutelage of Dr Peter Bishop (Chair, Studie=
s of the Future Program, University of Houston) to create scenarios of possi=
ble futures and their impacts on Enron. You once said, "I guarantee that if =
there is one thing Enron thinks about, it is what we'll do in the future." (=
ESpeak 2/29/00). With that in mind, you might find the following of interest=
 - our ideas and thoughts about Enron and the future. =20

The context created for envisioning possible futures for Enron was based upo=
n our opinion of Enron's core capability: our ability to effectively exploit=
 discontinuities in the marketplace. Enron has successfully exploited discon=
tinuities created by pipeline deregulation, resulting in the creation of Enr=
on; the Internet, resulting in electronic trading and on-line business activ=
ities/portals/exchanges; and telecom deregulation, resulting in bandwidth tr=
ading. Since Enron is so adept at this, we focused our activity specifically=
 on identifying potential future discontinuities and their implications to E=
nron. These are our conclusions:=20

Future: Rock Around the Clock =20
Description: Anytime you want it, anywhere you want it capability to transac=
t business/to do work.=20
Discontinuity/Trends: Builds on discontinuities created by the Internet and =
current technology trends of convergence, increased ubiquity, wireless and m=
iniaturization.=20
Enron In This Future: Is fully and entirely networked; primary revenue gener=
ation occurs via the communication wires. Business ops "rock around the cloc=
k", 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Employees are fully =
networked and fully connected, giving employees the choice of when and where=
 to work. Office space is no longer an issue because the employee IS the off=
ice. Employee uncertainties exist about privacy, lack of interpersonal relat=
ionships, and "wireless chains."
Wildcards: Major information systems disruption (global?) completely shuts d=
own business ops; Enron wires unknowingly become 24-7-365 facility for inter=
national wire fraud and money laundering. =20

Future: Not in My Region, You Don't=20
Description: The return of regional protectionism and increased government i=
nterference. Globalization is seen as too overpowering, prompting regions to=
 fight for a return of power and local sovereignty. The result is strong reg=
ional trading and political blocks that wield much influence. Their first ac=
tion: restrictions on international business activities.  =20
Discontinuity/Trends: Contrary to discontinuities created by the fall of com=
munism, and trends related to globalization and eroding boundaries; correspo=
nds with current trend related to increasing numbers of regional economic un=
ions (EU, CIS, ASEAN, Mercosur, NAFTA, etc).=20
Enron In This Future: Is ordered by international authorities to dispose of =
non-US based assets (at a loss) and is forced to vacate foreign countries. R=
etrenching back into the US occurs. Enron's competition becomes increasingly=
 intense and vicious as other multinationals retrench as well. This increase=
d competitiveness occurs at the same time collective group/industry action i=
s needed to counteract the action of the regional blocks, leaving Enron (and=
 others) struggling to find a balance.=20

Future: Regulation Re-run =20
Description: Power and telecom re-regulation occurs.=20
Discontinuities/Trends: Contradictory to current global trends toward privat=
ization of government services; supported by social and political reaction t=
o "CA style" market failures, perceived decline of competition due to provid=
er consolidation, perceived supply issues with water, gas, oil.=20
Enron In This Future: Goes "incognito", taking on a new identity. Government=
s seek to nationalize our assets.=20
Wildcard: propelled and facilitated by increased regionalism and protectioni=
sm (Not in My Region, You Don't).=20

Future: The Taxman Cometh - Even to Cyberspace=20
Description: Internet commerce has become so big, taxing authorities can no =
longer resist - taxes are levied on all Internet transactions.=20
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with current discussion by US and others=
 regarding Internet taxing; corresponds with the increasing power of the Int=
ernet as a purchasing mechanism.  =20
Enron In This Future: All of Enron's on-line transactions are now being taxe=
d. The volume of transactions still remains high; record keeping becomes a n=
ightmare.
Wildcards: Tax imposed is retroactive; government cannot track flow of funds=
 and ability to tax accurately is ineffective.

Future: Enron's New "Corporate DNA"=20
Description: rapid advances in biotech solutions lead to trading opportuniti=
es in biological "commodities."
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with: recent technological advancements =
in genome mapping and sequencing, and cloning; increased political/social di=
scussion regarding bio-ethics; increased business/social/political discussio=
n regarding bio-based intellectual property rights. Uncertainties exist rega=
rding the effect of biotech on human race/evolution.=20
Enron In This Future: Is the first biological commodities trader in the worl=
d. Focus is shifted from energy into the biotech realm. Move clearly positio=
ns Enron as a company of the BioTech Century. Enron structures the new bio-m=
arket and creates new types of bio-commodities paper. Biotech trading requir=
es a new type of trader with life sciences background; Enron forms relations=
hips with medical, nursing and other bio-based programs for recruitment.=20
Wildcards: biotech terrorism; worldwide epidemics; social opposition.=20

Historically, discontinuities such as these favor smaller companies because =
they are inherently quicker to respond. As Enron grows, we become more vulne=
rable to rapid market changes because it takes longer for us to "sense" them=
 and to react. While none of these discontinuities is certain of course, the=
re is merit in understanding they may occur so Enron can=20
"sense'" them and be prepared to respond early to the new opportunities they=
 may offer.=20

Of the futures this group constructed, Enron's New Corporate DNA is our most=
 interesting and merits further "flushing" for details. I'm sure this group =
could do that well, should you be interested. There could be significant opp=
ortunity for Enron in the bio-tech trading future.
