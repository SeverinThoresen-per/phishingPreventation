Hi Cooper,

Hope you had a good weekend. We were hoping to upload some metered volumes (=

 '0' in PETE) for the following days:

May 10 , 11, 12, 14 and 22.=20

Could you please re-scrape this data and give me call at ext. 6777 or fire b=
ack an e-mail when this data has been re-scraped.

Thanks alot,

Rob
