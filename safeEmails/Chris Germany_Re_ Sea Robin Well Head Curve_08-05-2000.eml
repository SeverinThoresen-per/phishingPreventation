Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.

I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea=20
Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La=20
curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the=20
following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;

Meter
4743
4747
4741
4754
4771
4753
4794
4728
4700
4749
4751
9740
6335
6333
4794
4700
4850
ISRP84
FSRP3
2SRP9


Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.

I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of=20
those ISRP meters.  The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool=20
and incur transport.  Therefore having two zone would more accurately=20
represent what is actually happening.

I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different=
=20
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility=20
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.  Currently=
,=20
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of=20
ISRP.  That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility=20
mappings.  Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to=
=20
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone. =20
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities=20
would have to change the zone on every single facility record.  Plus, we=20
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we=20
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities=20
made it's change.  So, let me know what your thoughts are.  What are you=20
doing in London???

Imelda,

I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone.  The only part o=

Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP.  I'm=20

David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR).  The Sea=20
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefi=
x=20
of ISRP.  However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the=20
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP.  I mapped the entire zone to the ne=
w=20
curves you sent us.  Given your message it seems like things might not be=20
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way.  Please=
=20
call me as soon as you get a chance.

I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but=20
as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve,=20
then everything will be peachy.

Dave - they called me on this to see if it was a meter mapping or a zone=20
mapping.  I said zone.....

Imelda and Karie,

The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea=20
Robin Pool/ISRP zone.  The curve is already set up in Erms.  Please do your=20
sitara voodoo to map the above location to this new curve.
