I know that the timing on choosing these interns was short.  Thanks for resp=
onding back to Jana so quickly.  And now most of them will be here next Mond=
ay!  Please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a=
 location, phone and computer (with necessary access granted) for these inte=
rns.  I want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introductio=
n to working at Enron. =20

This list excludes those that will assigned to EGM under Brent Price and his=
 team.  As soon as I get an updated list from Jana, I will schedule a meetin=
g for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a su=
ccess this summer.  All ideas will be welcome, so get creative before coming=
 to the meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally =20
