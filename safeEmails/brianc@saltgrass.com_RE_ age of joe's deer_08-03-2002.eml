I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen t=
hat 10 point I shot "on the hoof", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower=
 jaw for inspection, you would have said "Damn, that's an old deer."=20
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler forma=
tion (9" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, =
and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had ab=
out 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was m=
ore on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side=
, the younger one looked like a "thoroughbread Horse", while mine looked lik=
e a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we =
are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together ab=
out what "formula" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10=
 point was "Mature and on his way down" while the young one (Same deer that =
Keith has seen, too) is "Mature and on his way up". The last thing I have to=
 say about that was that the "Young" deer of the two was definitely the "dom=
inant" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my "ol' bastard" and th=
e old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesti=
ng by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two.=
 Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that yo=
unger sibling was gonna get the chance to "pour the Chili" while the old guy=
 snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the "stud", ate enough to surv=
ive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased d=
oes around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer need=
ed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a =
Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and d=
oesn't "disappear" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from yea=
r to year.=20
