ome feedback from her without
    her having to fill out additional forms if that sounds OK with you.  Tha=
nks. Lynn

Lynn, I have no problem with Shirley, however, since she has began working f=
rom home, I have had limited interaction with her due to our work schedules.=
  She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry).=
  Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team t=
hat I work with more closely, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

Randy
