Hey:
1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hour=
s when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearran=
ged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be leg=
al on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged tra=
ding is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE'=
s volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to IC=
E in the current state. =20
2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance,=
 a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the=
 2 trades additive. =20

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support th=
eir system, unless absolutely necessary.

Hi..=20
I hope you are all ok.. I am sorry for any losses that may have touched your=
 friends and family..

I looked at the ICE/LCH announcements.

I have a few questions:
1. Will ICE be able to work as a deal entry system as well as mechanism to p=
ost markets?

My concern here is that under the Deutsche proposal we would be able to do a=
 deal with you over the phone and then post it to their system.. and no othe=
r market participant would be able to see that transaction.. it would then g=
o straight to the clearing.

Currently, I'd say that only 2% of the time ICE has a tighter market than EO=
L.. this because they do not have the liquidity (and likely will not).

There is not a high probability we would ever contribute to this liquidity o=
ver our own system (Enron online) so the ability to deal directly with you i=
n still imperative.=20

2. Can margin at LCH be netted across products?

Looking forward to speaking.
Thanks and Regards,
Caroline
