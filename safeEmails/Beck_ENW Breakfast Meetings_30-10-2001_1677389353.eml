Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series o=
f breakfast meetings:
(example noted below from today's meeting)

Name			Title		Group 				Direct Supervisor


Jeff Gossett		Director		Operations - Gas Risk (EA)	Bob Hall=20

La Metrice Dopson	Sr. Director	IT Infrastructure			Jenny Rub=20



Mark, Greg and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled =
breakfast meeting.  The group description may be the most difficult to get, =
but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership=
 team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the deta=
ils - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just=
 make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the =
organization. =20

I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that wa=
s held this morning.  Thanks. =20

--Sally=20

Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited t=
o the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directo=
rs and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I=
 just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks.=20
