As we all know, our activation date of the AT&T DS3 is drawing nearer (proje=
cted date at this time is 05/31/01). Until that date we still have a large d=
ependency on the Terminal Server (TS) environment in Houston. If you have a =
TS issue, please follow the below steps:

=B7	Ask co-workers around you if they are experiencing TS issues
=B7	is it TS in general or a specific application
=B7	Contact a member of local IT support (Steiner's Team & Mike Tully)
=B7	Communicate your findings
=B7	IT support will troubleshoot and, if needed, escalate to local Developme=
nt team (Poston's Team) or TS support team in Houston (Hawthorn's Team)
=B7	Communicate to you status, resolution, and permanent fix (if applicable)

If you require to have the TS session reset extended for running the reports=
, please contact Andrew Hawthorn directly via email. This request has a 1 da=
y turnaround SLA. This process requires one server to be isolated for your u=
se which impacts others in the ENA world.

Dave Steiner and Andrew Hawthorn (TS Support Team Lead) and their respective=
 teams will continue to do their best to maintain a stable environment for y=
our business needs. When unseen issues occur, they will do their best to add=
ress them in a timely manner. Please continue to communicate your business n=
eeds through Dave Steiner. The one exception to this will be requesting the =
TS session timeout extended.

Following are agreed upon SLAs from the TS Support Team:

	NEW REQUESTS				SLA=09
	Application moved to TS	production		1 week=20
	TS session reset extended			1 day
	H:\ drive creation in Houston for TS		2 days

We all understand that there are times when unforeseen circumstances arise a=
nd the above notice is not possible. IT will work with you to do the best we=
 can to meet your requirements.

Please advise if you have any questions or concerns.
