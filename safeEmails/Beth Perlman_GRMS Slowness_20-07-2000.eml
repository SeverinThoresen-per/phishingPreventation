I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the=20
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there=
=20
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review=20
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to=20
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once=20
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share the=
m=20
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  W=
e=20
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front en=
d=20
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.

Beth
