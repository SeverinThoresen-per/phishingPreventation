Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on=20
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location=20
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this,=
=20
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the=
=20
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will=20
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance,=
=20
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a=20
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the=20
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need=20
access to EnPower production.=20

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548
Martha Stevens  MSteven x3-4742

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward=20
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina=20
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North=20
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I woul=
d=20
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know. =20
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have th=
e=20
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
