Mike,
Since the IT guys want to wait for the new software to put your cost analysi=
s on the plasma screens I am currently working on using Reuters so that we'l=
l have something in the meantime.  I had to call Lori Hernandez, Reuters con=
tact, and have her add some more products to Kobra.  As soon as she gets bac=
k to me I'll put that together and get it on the screens.  Let me know if yo=
u have other questions.

Aaron
