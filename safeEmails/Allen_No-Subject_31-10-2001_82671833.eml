Renee,

I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last=
 Thursday.  I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be mad=
e off-cycle. =20
However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct de=
posit.  Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
