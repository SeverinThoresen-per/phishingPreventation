Gary -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee =
contact information during Tropical Storm Allison & during recent system out=
ages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.  W=
hen systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I a=
m now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diske=
tte.

 Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-Enron ISP that co=
uld be accessed from our Home ISP if the Enron intranet or servers are down?

ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to=
 provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home p=
hone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the=
 collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonlin=
e. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either=
 ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) wh=
en first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the =
eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request.

While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact da=
ta (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases=
 disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If yo=
u are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number publ=
ished, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your pe=
rsonal contact information.=20

To access eHRonline, go to the ETS HRWeb link: https://ehronline.enron.com/ =
and select eHRonline. Employees must enter their SAP Personnel Number and Pa=
ssword to enter the system.  If you do not know your SAP Personnel Number or=
 Password, please contact the Integrated Solutions Center at (713)-345-4727.
