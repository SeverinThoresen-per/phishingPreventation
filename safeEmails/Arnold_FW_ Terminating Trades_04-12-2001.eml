Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispu=
te.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  =
It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether th=
e deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this? =20

Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so t=
hat we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I sp=
oke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after=
 we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even=
 though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?
