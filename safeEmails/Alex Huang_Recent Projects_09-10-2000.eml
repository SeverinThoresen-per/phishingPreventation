Hi Vince,
I have been working on and/or planning to work on the following projects:
1.  Finished a gas daily swing option model for commodity structuring=20
group (Sanjeev Khanna).  The model uses American Monte Carlo=20
Simulation and dynamic programming techniques.=20

2. Continue working on PSIM model. This includes reading power generation
and operation books as well as thinking about ways to model power plant and
its operation. The standard approach (i.e. turn the plant on if power=20
price>total
generation cost, else turn the plant off) is not particularly good if the=20
regional
demand is very high and the plant still has some un-utilized generation=20
capacity.
That is, the generation criteria is quite different depending on we model=20
power=20
plant from regional point view or from plant point of view.  Plan to have=20
meetings
with Tom and Lance.=20

3.  Started working on stochastic process parameter estimation.  I will=20
concentrate
on four processes: GBM, mean reverting, jump diffusion, and jump diffusion=20
with
mean reverting.  I have looked at Tanya's earlier  work and decided to=20
discretize
the processes slightly differently.  It is hoped that this will give a more=20
stable
estimation.=20

Best,
Alex
