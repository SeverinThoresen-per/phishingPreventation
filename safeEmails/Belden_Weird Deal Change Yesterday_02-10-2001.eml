Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book =
was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $180=
 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between FS=
P and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happe=
ned, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems =
are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P=
&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to curren=
t market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let the tradin=
g team know what happened.
