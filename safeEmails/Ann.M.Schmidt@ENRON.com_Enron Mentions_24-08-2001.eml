A television ad running these days in India shows a mother lapsing into a da=
ydream: Her young daughter is in a beauty contest dressed as Snow White, dan=
cing on a stage. Her flowing gown is an immaculate white. The garments of ot=
her contestants, who dance in the background, are a tad gray. Snow White, no=
 surprise, wins the blue ribbon. The mother awakes to the laughter of her ad=
oring family--and glances proudly at her Whirlpool White Magic washing machi=
ne.=20
The TV spot is the product of 14 months of research by Whirlpool Corp. into =
the psyche of the Indian consumer. Among other things, the Benton Harbor (Mi=
ch.) company learned Indian homemakers prize hygiene and purity, which they =
associate with white. The trouble is, white garments often get discolored af=
ter frequent machine washing in local water. Besides appealing to this love =
of purity in its ads, Whirlpool custom-designed machines that are especially=
 good with white fabrics.
Whirlpool hasn't stopped there. It uses generous incentives to get thousands=
 of Indian retailers to stock its goods. To reach every cranny of the vast n=
ation, it uses local contractors conversant in India's 18 languages to colle=
ct payments in cash and deliver appliances by truck, bicycles, even oxcart. =
Since 1996, Whirlpool's sales in India have leapt 80%--and should hit $200 m=
illion this year. Whirlpool now is the leading brand in India's fast-growing=
 market for fully automatic washing machines.=20
Whirlpool's success story stands out in a time when Corporate America doesn'=
t talk much about emerging markets. Things were different a decade ago. That=
's when Western economies had stalled, so expanding operations into the fast=
-growing, heavily populated lands of Asia, Latin America, and the old Soviet=
 bloc was a top priority. The approach to globalization then was brutally si=
mple: get in fast, strike megadeals with top officials, and watch the profit=
s roll in. Multinationals figured local consumers would snap up their produc=
ts at a premium. Thus AT&T promised some 20 ventures in China, from state-of=
-the-art telecom factories to research labs. Enron Corp. negotiated giant po=
wer plants and pipeline projects in India, Indonesia, and Bolivia. General M=
otors Corp. envisioned an Asiawide network of car plants, led by its $1.2 bi=
llion facility in Shanghai. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Many of these bets fizzle=
d or disappointed. Enron's $4 billion Indian power plant is a debacle. Other=
 multinationals saw that local competitors can catch up fast--and beat them =
in price and marketing. Tumbling trade barriers are making local production =
less essential. Meanwhile, a globalization backlash has forced companies to =
view their activities in poor nations in a different light. Exxon Mobil, Car=
gill, Freeport-McMoRan, and Royal Dutch/Shell became targets of local uprisi=
ngs over oil, mining, and other projects in Indonesia, India, and Nigeria. M=
cDonald's, KFC, and Philip Morris have endured withering criticism at home a=
nd abroad for aggressively pushing inappropriate products and ignoring local=
 sensibilities.=20
The financial crises that ravaged nations like Mexico, Thailand, Russia, Bra=
zil, and Turkey didn't help. Suddenly, ``emerging markets'' connoted excessi=
ve risk. Indeed, compared to the booming U.S. of the late '90s and a unifyin=
g Western Europe, emerging markets looked irrelevant to many execs. After ex=
plosive growth in the early 1990s, foreign direct investment by U.S. compani=
es in East Asia, excluding Japan, plunged by 74% to $1.33 billion from 1997 =
to 2000, estimates the U.S. Commerce Dept. The drops have been nearly as dra=
matic in Latin America and Eastern Europe.=20
But as Whirlpool and other savvy U.S. companies such as Kodak, Citigroup, an=
d Hewlett-Packard are proving, investing time and energy to understand socie=
ties in developing nations can pay rich returns. Rather than swinging for th=
e fences with megaprojects or costly takeovers, the smarter approach is to m=
ethodically build a presence from the ground up. Some of the best investment=
s are the most economical--small corner kiosks instead of full-blown stores =
or bank branches, say, or a tie-up with a savvy local player who owns a fact=
ory. Says Bain & Co. global strategist Chris Zook: ``Companies are trying to=
 figure out how to build on their strengths, as opposed to throwing a bunch =
of Hail Mary passes in the hope they connect.''=20
Above all, smart globalization requires extensive homework. Companies are st=
arting to work closely with bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, and social groups at=
 the grass roots. Not only is it easier to head off a local political backla=
sh by cooperating with local players early; multinationals are also finding =
they can save enormous resources--and develop products local consumers reall=
y need.=20
Whirlpool has learned many of these lessons. Eight years after launching its=
 global blitz in 1989, it took a $294 million writedown to shed two of the f=
our appliance plants it built in China. ``What we absolutely missed was how =
fast these markets would become saturated,'' concedes CEO David R. Whitwam. =
``We could build plants around the world, but where you fail is in the marke=
tplace.''=20
Now, Whitwam believes Whirlpool is on track. Besides its sophisticated marke=
ting and inroads with local distributors, the company reorganized its global=
 factory network. For all appliances, it devises basic models that use about=
 70% of the same parts. Then it modifies its machines for local tastes. Whir=
lpool has an incentive to get it right: Through 2009, it expects demand for =
big appliances in the U.S. to remain flat, while it projects demand overseas=
 will grow 17%, to 293 million units.=20
Similar dynamics are pushing other companies to renew their global focus. De=
veloping nations are still likely to grow much faster than the industrial We=
st for at least a decade (chart, page 136). What's more, most multinationals=
 today target mainly the richest 10% of the global population. They've yet t=
o reach the 4 billion who earn the equivalent of $1,500 or less annually. Fe=
w can afford a PC, car, or mortgage now. But many experts argue they will be=
 the greatest source of future global growth. That's why Hewlett-Packard Co.=
 has launched a drive to help stimulate computer use in villages from Centra=
l America to Africa (page 137). The HP program also is politically shrewd: I=
t promotes the beneficial aspect of globalization to the neediest.=20
Citibank's new campaign to broaden its traditional base of rich clients exem=
plifies the new approach to emerging markets. In Bangalore, India, it launch=
ed a program called Suvidha--Hindi for ``ease.'' It persuaded midsized compa=
nies to set up retail bank accounts for their entire staffs, from janitors t=
o top managers. To open accounts, customers need just $22. They get a card t=
hey can use to get cash, take out loans, pay bills at local ATMs, and buy gr=
oceries. In three years, Citi has gained 200,000 retail clients, doubling it=
s base in India, for about $10 million.=20
In corporate banking, Citi is targeting companies with revenues of $50 milli=
on or less. India's trucking business has been one priority. By opening offi=
ces in 23 cities offering credit, savings, and checking accounts, Citi now f=
inances 10,000 truckers--most with fewer than 30 vehicles. It also is gearin=
g up in Poland, Brazil, and the Philippines. Since 1997, small-business clie=
nts in emerging markets have risen sixfold, to 8.7 million. ``The lower segm=
ents of these markets is where the growth is,'' says Citibank CEO Victor J. =
Menezes. Such markets earned Citigroup $2.7 billion in net profits last year=
=2E=20
Other U.S. companies are finding they can get ahead working with small entre=
preneurs eager for new ways to make money. That's one reason emerging market=
s are a bright spot for Eastman Kodak Co. While Kodak has struggled in the U=
=2ES., in Asia, sales were up 9% last year. Much of this is because of Kodak=
 Express photo supply and development shops, often owned by entrepreneurs su=
ch as Qiu Xing, 28. The Shanghai native, who says he had ``always been a pho=
tography buff,'' invested $48,000 to open his shop in January. In a deal wit=
h a Chinese bank, Kodak lets Qiu use his developing equipment as loan collat=
eral even though he hasn't fully paid for it. Kodak also supplies monthly st=
aff training. Qiu takes in $5,000 a month and makes a 25% profit.=20
Kodak has 6,000 Expresses across China and expects 10,000 by yearend. Its ma=
rket share in China has doubled since 1995, to 60%. ``We moved so fast, our =
competitors didn't have time to act,'' boasts John Tseng, a Kodak general ma=
nager for Asia.=20
In these turbulent times, when political and currency crises rock government=
s from Jakarta to Buenos Aires, it's hard to tell when emerging markets will=
 be the predictable lands of opportunity CEOs once foresaw. But that was alw=
ays an illusion--and it's time Corporate America figures out what really wor=
ks. ``The next round of global expansion is as much about imagination as abo=
ut resources,'' says University of Michigan management guru C.K. Prahalad: `=
`Putting a billion dollars down does not involve imagination.'' With the mis=
takes of the '90s behind them, the winners will approach the world in a smar=

Group of Utilities In West Says Rates Now Are Too Low
By Robert Gavin and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A coalition of Western utilities -- including some that pushed successfully =
for price caps on wholesale electricity earlier this year -- now is complain=
ing that prices have fallen too low.=20
At least three utilities are requesting retail rate increases to cover power=
 costs from earlier in the year, in part, because low wholesale prices mean =
they are no longer able to completely offset those costs with power-sale rev=
enue. Prices have been falling for months, and dropped even further after Ju=
ne 19 when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed regionwide whole=
sale price limits.
Early this week, 14 Western utilities asked FERC to reconsider its order, co=
mplaining now that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help California, but h=
urt utilities in neighboring states.=20
Under the FERC order, Western power generators may charge no more than $92 p=
er megawatt hour, currently, for power sold into the California market and s=
lightly less outside the Golden State, unless they can prove their generatin=
g costs are higher. Traders, including utilities that bought too much power,=
 are held to the capped level no matter what their costs. But the caps are s=
omewhat moot since energy currently is trading at far less on the open marke=
t.=20
Power prices in February, according to Platt's Energy Trader, a daily public=
ation of McGraw-Hill Cos., for two important Northwest pricing points ranged=
 between $220 and $400 per megawatt hour. By yesterday, midday electricity f=
or delivery at the same points was selling for $33 per megawatt hour.=20
Portland General Electric bought power last winter for late-summer deliverie=
s at $200 to $250 per megawatt hour, says Robin Tompkins, assistant general =
counsel. "Now we're having a hard time unwinding those positions."=20
Portland General, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston, is asking for a record 3=
0% increase in residential rates, which would take the price to roughly eigh=
t cents per kilowatt hour from about six cents, and a 45% to 60% increase in=
 commercial rates. That is because the Portland, Ore., utility only is able =
to supply half the power its customers need from its own power plants. For t=
he rest, it must go to the open market and make purchases.=20
When it resells power it doesn't need, it now is forced to do so at a loss, =
says Ms. Tompkins. That isn't at all what it expected during the time of yea=
r when prices typically reach their zenith. It puts further pressure on rate=
s, she adds.=20
The drop in prices back to the 1999 level is prompting rate increase request=
s from other utilities. In May, for example, Avista Corp., Spokane, Wash., a=
greed to defer rate increases needed to recover more than $100 million in un=
anticipated power-purchase costs. The idea was the utility, with 313,000 cus=
tomers in Idaho and Washington, would recover those costs over the next two =
years by selling excess power once drought-stricken hydroelectric generating=
 conditions improved and its new 270-megawatt natural-gas-fired plant came o=
n line next year.=20
But Avista now is seeking a 36.9% rate increase in Washington and 15% increa=
se in Idaho because the utility no longer believes wholesale prices will be =
high enough to pay off earlier power-purchase costs. This week, Puget Sound =
Energy, a unit of Puget Energy Inc., Bellevue, Wash., asked Washington regul=
ators to grant an 18% residential rate increase to recover some $84 million =
in power costs, saying falling power-sale revenues mean ratepayers have to p=
ick up a bigger share of costs.=20
Washington Public Counsel Simon Ffitch, who represents ratepayers in utility=
 cases, says the rate increases "appear to be an effort to shift the risks o=
f power-cost fluctuations to ratepayers from stockholders."

AFRICA & THE AMERICAS: Enron issues veiled sanction threat to India=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and KHOZEM MERCHANT

Energy giant Enron has issued a veiled threat to India that it could face ne=
w US sanctions unless the company and its partners get back the full Dollars=
 1bn (Pounds 600m) in costs incurred building a power plant there.=20
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, sa=
id: "There are US laws that could prevent the US government from providing a=
ny aid or assistance to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate pr=
operty of US companies."=20
The warning comes at a sensitive time as the Bush administration is trying t=
o improve its long-strained relations with India. Two weeks ago Richard Armi=
tage, US deputy secretary of state, predicted an early lifting of the sancti=
ons imposed in the aftermath of India's nuclear tests in May 1988.=20
Enron launched arbitration proceedings earlier this year after its Dollars 2=
=2E9bn Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the =
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to =
pay bills that now total about Dollars 45m. It said Enron's tariffs - four t=
imes greater than those levied by domestic power producers - were too expens=
ive. But Enron says the basis for calculating the tariffs was in the contrac=
t and asked the Indian government to buy its stake earlier this month.=20
Mr Lay's demand for full-cost compensation is regarded as optimistic by some=
 bankers in Bombay. One executive at a foreign bank said a more attainable s=
olution would be one "that allows Enron to get out at 70 cents to the dollar=
", suggesting a significant writedown by Enron.=20
Mr Lay said in the interview: "If they try to squeeze us down to something l=
ess than cost then it basically becomes an expropriation by the Indian gover=
nment, and that would send an incredibly damaging signal to the internationa=
l capital markets and investment community as to making any future investmen=
ts in India."=20
His threat is likely to irritate the Indian government, which is eager to re=
ach a face-saving compromise amid a strong domestic anti-Enron lobby, withou=
t disturbing warming bilateral ties with Washington.=20
Mr Lay is known to have warm relations with the Bush administration, which h=
as its roots in the company's home base of Texas.=20
Mr Lay said the Indian government had indicated it wanted to solve this prob=
lem quickly and amicably. Both sides are working with an international recon=
ciliation team. But Mr Lay said the alternative of continuing with arbitrati=
on remained. "We have very, very tight contracts, and we'll enforce those co=
ntracts," he said. Interview, Page 22=20

NATIONAL NEWS: US power trader may buy Hatfield mine=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By MATTHEW JONES

Enron, the US power trader, has emerged as the leading contender to buy Hatf=
ield colliery near Doncaster, which went into liquidation earlier this month=
 with the loss of 220 jobs.=20
The news follows the government's decision late on Wednesday to grant a four=
-week stay of execution to the mine by pledging Pounds 200,000 to keep it op=
en on a care and maintenance basis.=20
The 80-year-old pit, which appeared in scenes from the film Brassed Off, was=
 the last producing mine in north Doncaster, once the hub of the English coa=
l industry.=20
It had been negotiating a contract to supply coal to Drax power station, own=
ed by AES of the US, but went into liquidation on August 13 after failing to=
 secure loans needed to expand production. Enron has been talking to Hatfiel=
d Coal Company, the mine's private operator, since before it collapsed. An o=
bserver close to the negotiations said Enron was continuing to show interest=
 and had resumed coal supply talks with AES.=20
UK Coal, Britain's largest deep mine operator, is paying Pounds 1m a year to=
 keep the adjacent Thorne colliery mothballed. The group has said it may dev=
elop the site as a replacement for Selby colliery, which is due to close by =
the end of the decade, but it is under pressure to cut costs and has ruled o=
ut a purchase of Hatfield.=20
The mine had been due to be capped and abandoned on Tuesday. But Brian Wilso=
n, energy minister, agreed on Wednesday to provide Pounds 50,000 a week for =
the next four weeks to keep the mine shafts ventilated and drained. The deci=
sion is thought to be the first time public money has been used to delay the=
 closure of a privately owned mine since state coal assets were sold off in =
1994.=20
Industry experts believe Hatfield has reserves of 15m-23m tonnes of coal but=
 would need investment of about Pounds 45m to access them. Ian Roxburgh, chi=
ef executive of the Coal Authority, which has assumed ownership of the under=
ground workings, said: "Once maintenance of mine shafts ceases they would qu=
ickly fill up with water and gas, making the costs of re-starting production=
 prohibitive."=20
The official receiver disclaimed its lease for the mine on Wednesday but ret=
ained ownership of the surface site and responsibility for disposal of the c=
ompany's assets. Sanctions threat, Page 6=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Returning hero fights to stop free-fall IN=
TERVIEW KENNETH LAY, ENRON CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE:=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY

When Kenneth Lay, chair-man and chief executive of Enron, returned to the to=
p job at the US energy group, he was touched to receive a standing ovation f=
rom the 1,400 staff at his first meeting with employees.=20
The level of support for Mr Lay's second stint in the top job has encouraged=
 him, and he vows to leave the company "substantially bigger and more profit=
able" when he resigns as CEO in 2005.=20
During his first 15-year stint at the top, Mr Lay transformed Enron from a r=
egional natural gas pipeline company into a leading electricity, natural gas=
 and communications company.=20
Market capitalisation rose during his tenure from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 70b=
n. The company reported revenue of Dollars 101bn in 2000.=20
Mr Lay's replacement, Jeffrey Skilling, lasted just six months in the job un=
til he resigned last week for "personal reasons".=20
Mr Lay said in an interview with the Financial Times that he believed Enron =
stood a good chance of continuing to grow 20 per cent a year, enabling it to=
 double its net income about every three and a half years.=20
He plans to appoint one or two top executives, fairly quickly, to the Office=
 of the Chairman to help guide that growth. The appointee(s) will be on the =
shortlist of those who eventually will be considered for CEO.=20
Mr Lay is considering Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation =
Services; Mark Frevert, chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Greg W=
halley, president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services; D=
avid Delainey, chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services; and John Sherriff,=
 president and CEO of Enron Europe.=20
"There is no big rush on this CEO appointment," Mr Lay says. "The board has =
made it very clear that we are going to take our time. I have extended my co=
ntract through 2005. I'll stay that long if needed. I'll stay longer if need=
ed." And he will continue to review the ranks for the best replacement durin=
g that period.=20
In the meantime, Mr Lay will have to grapple with controversies in its India=
n, California and broadband operations.=20
Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity board=
 over a power project, India's biggest foreign investment. It is among sever=
al energy traders facing questions in California over accusations of a manip=
ulation of power prices - charges it denies.=20
The group has also been hit hard from poorly performing broadband operations=
=2E But perhaps even more pressing is the stock price, which has fallen more=
 than 55 per cent since the start of the year.=20
Mr Lay said he would do the best he could to stop the free-fall, spending as=
 much time as possible meeting portfolio managers and analysts to make sure =
people understand the growth potential of the company.=20
Enron's main profit centre is its North American operations, where its energ=
y wholesale business is key. But he notes the company is transferring its bu=
siness model to other countries in Europe and eventually to Japan, as well a=
s to industrial markets, including coal, steel and pulp and paper.=20
Because of the company's rapid growth, many analysts say they remain confuse=
d about facets of the new "Enron model" - something Mr Lay is eager to recti=
fy.=20
"The business model is basically a matter of physical volumes delivered," Mr=
 Lay says. "Physical volumes of natural gas, electricity, coal, metals, what=
ever, but physical volumes delivered . . . We're doing the very same thing t=
hat the physically integrated company is doing, but we're doing it, in many =
cases, with other people's assets."=20
Those assets include everything from pipelines to power plants to transmissi=
on lines to coal freighters. Enron owns some and leases or rents others.=20
"The customer wants to buy so much natural gas or electricity, and we delive=
r it," Mr Lay says. "And we deliver it at the lowest possible price and in t=
he most reliable way possible. That is how we are competitive."=20

Enron's Lay Raises Possibility of Sanctions on India (Update1)

Enron's Lay Raises Possibility of Sanctions on India (Update1)

     (Adds analyst's, negotiator's comments in eighth, 12th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Kenneth Lay said the Indian government could be subject to U.S.
sanctions unless the top energy trader and its partners recover $1
billion they invested in an Indian utility, the Financial Times
reported.

     Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co., which runs the $3
billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. It is
owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its
sole customer, in unpaid bills for 8 months. The board in May
stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive.

     ``Ken didn't make any kind of threat,'' Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said, adding that Lay was responding to a question about
what might motivate the Indian government to help break the
deadlock.

     Palmer said the company hasn't been in contact with the Bush
administration regarding any form of U.S. sanctions against India.
Spokesmen for both the White House and the State Department said
they knew of no request from Enron for such action to be taken.
Lay was a major donor to the Bush campaign.

     Enron began looking to sell its stake in the project after
the negotiation panel failed to get other buyers for its power.
Eight Indian states said they would buy electricity but at less
than half the price charged by Dabhol. Enron said it has invested
$875 million in the project and is ready to sell to the government
its stake at cost.

     ``There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government
from providing any aid or assistance or other things to India
going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of U.S.
companies,'' Lay said in the Financial Times.

                          Nuclear Weapons

     Enron spokesman John Ambler said that while Lay stopped short
of saying that India has expropriated Enron property, the company
would consider it expropriation if it was denied recovery of its
costs after asset values were diluted by government action.

     ``First, Enron's assets haven't been expropriated yet. And
expropriation is not even allowed under the Indian law,'' said
R.K. Pachauri, director at Tata Energy Research Institute. ``The
power purchase agreement has provisions to solve any dispute. You
can't toss that (the contract) aside.''

     Pachauri was on a five-member panel that suggested ways to
reduce Dabhol's power tariff. He quit after the committee was
asked by the Maharashtra state government to renegotiate the
project as well.

     The Clinton administration imposed sanctions against India
and Pakistan in May 1998, after the two traditional enemies tested
nuclear weapons within days of each other.

     The sanctions were partially lifted in late 1999. The
Washington Post quoted Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage
saying earlier this month that the Bush administration and
Congress were planning to begin work in September to accelerate
lifting the sanctions. No final decision has been announced.

     ``The dispute (between Enron and Maharashtra) is a commercial
one and has nothing to do with the economic sanctions'' on India,
said Madhav Godbole, who headed a committee set up to resolve the
payment dispute. ``The parties are governed by the power purchase
agreement'' that provides for arbitration as a way to solve the
dispute.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 30 cents to $36.96. They
have fallen 56 percent so far this year.



Enron Plans To Buy UK Hatfield Colliery - FT

08/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is interested in buying Hatfield, a U=
=2EK. colliery near Doncaster in north Yorkshire, and is in talks with AES C=
orp. (AES) to supply coal to that company's 3,870-megawatt Drax plant, the F=
inancial Times reported Friday.=20
Enron declined to comment on the report.
Industry experts estimate that reserves at Hatfield, totaling 15-23 million =
metric tons, will cost GBP45 million to exploit.=20
Hatfield is an 80-year-old mine that was due to be closed Tuesday, but was r=
escued by government funds to be maintained for a restart. Before going into=
 liquidation on Aug. 13, its operators were negotiating a contract to supply=
 coal to Drax.=20
U.K. Coal, the largest operator of deep mines in Britain, may develop a moth=
balled colliery at Thorne, but pressure to cut costs has ruled out a purchas=
e of Hatfield.=20
Coal has enjoyed a renaissance in the U.K. power industry this year as the p=
rice of gas, the fuel with which it competes most directly, has stayed stubb=
ornly high.=20
In addition, many of the larger coal-fired plants subdivide into units that =
offer more flexibility than corresponding gas-fired plant. These are consequ=
ently able to dominate the higher-value end of the power market under the Ne=
w Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March.=20
Officials at AES did however confirm contact with Enron over Hatfield.=20
"We have a strong relationship with Enron and they have, in a preliminary di=
scussion, expressed interest in long term deals to supply coal, if they buy =
Hatfield," said John Levons, Commercial and Fuel Business Leader at Drax.=20
"We can contract with domestic producers because the plant is fully fitted w=
ith desulphurization equipment, so the higher content of sulphur doesn't aff=
ect us as much," he added.=20
Since AES purchased the plant one year ago, around 90% of Drax's coal comes =
from domestic sources, and all new contracts are with domestic producers.=20
Drax is a modern station that could be operational for 30 to 40 years.=20

Tony Duplisse is pointing at perhaps the ugliest light fixture ever to illum=
inate a palm tree.=20
"There's no light coming out, and it's just not very pleasant to look at, sa=
id Duplisse, standing near the swimming pool at Toscana, an apartment comple=
x in Irvine where rents run $1,200 to $1,800 a month.
Duplisse has a list of 2,000 light bulbs, fixtures and signs on the 566-unit=
 property that will be replaced or tossed in the trash.=20
"Look at this," he said, pointing to an innocuous exit sign, lighted red at =
high noon. "We've got 350 signs like this, and this is just one property.=20
It's unbelievable.=20
Conservation by consumers and businesses is one of the primary reasons Calif=
ornia has breezed through the summer with no rolling blackouts.=20
That's why companies like Chicago-based Equity Residential Properties Trust =
, whose chairman is billionaire Sam Zell, created a funky new job -- "utilit=
y czar" -- putting one man in charge of trimming millions of dollars from th=
e company's power bills.=20
"I didn't set out to be the utility czar," said Duplisse, an Oklahoma native=
 and former semipro rugby player. "When my boss sent out the e-mail naming m=
e utility czar, I knew I was in for an endless barrage of ribbing."=20
Duplisse got tapped for the job this year after he saved the real estate inv=
estment trust a tidy sum on water bills at 75 properties in Arizona.=20
Other large apartment owners in Orange County, including ArchStone Communiti=
es and Western National Group, both of Irvine, are taking similar steps to c=
ut costs.=20
When politicians and big energy users touted the 1996 deregulation law, they=
 said it would lower energy costs. But that hasn't happened in California. I=
nstead, deregulation has pushed prices higher and been a boon for a burgeoni=
ng industry known as energy services.=20
The same generators and marketers that sell or swap power with California --=
 Enron Corp., Duke Energy and Dynegy Inc. -- have created separate business =
units to sell products and advice to corporations, hotels, apartment complex=
es and retail chains that want to lower energy costs.=20
"This is just the beginning of the industry," said Craig Goodman, president =
of the National Energy Marketers Association, a trade group that lobbies for=
 full deregulation of the energy and natural-gas markets. "There are strong =
margins and savings in cutting energy costs, both for the energy marketers a=
nd for companies."=20
Duplisse, who previously worked for Walden Residential Properties in Dallas,=
 believes the energy crisis, which is sweeping the country along with hot we=
ather, forces conservation. "If you combined lighting, gas and water savings=
 over the last few years, we'd be saving hundreds of thousands of dollars," =
he said.=20
During a one-day stop in California recently, Duplisse toured nearly 14 prop=
erties owned by Equity Residential, driving from Burbank to Valencia to Bake=
rsfield, then back to Los Angeles and Orange County. The company owns seven =
Orange County properties, including Merrimac Woods in Costa Mesa, Regency Pa=
lms in Huntington Beach and Villa Solana Apartments in Mission Viejo.=20
With 78 properties in Southern California, Equity Residential also is cashin=
g in on rebates paid by taxpayers for installing energy-efficient lights.=20
As utility czar, Duplisse takes bids from contractors who do the work of rep=
lacing lights and changing fixtures. For example, by replacing just one halo=
gen light in a swimming pool -- which are energy gluttons -- with a metal ha=
lide, a high-powered fuel source, the company saves $30 a year.=20
The new light also lasts longer and typically generates more light.=20
Duplisse's team of five managers-turned-energy experts track the number of l=
ights at each property, the wattage levels, and the savings achieved by repl=
acing them.=20
Multiply those savings by thousands of lights, and the money saved will prob=
ably make the risk-averse shareholders of Equity Residential sit up and take=
 notice.=20
"In terms of the scope of energy, there's nothing bigger," Duplisse said, ex=
plaining how replacing light bulbs at Toscana will cut $87,000 from the prop=
erty's yearly electricity bill.=20
After California, the energy team will move on to the Pacific Northwest in a=
n effort to get ahead of an expected natural-gas crisis there this winter.=20
The team expects to canvass the company's 983 properties in 36 states over s=
everal years.=20
What does he think of the deregulation? Duplisse shakes his head.=20
"I'm real apolitical. I can't make heads or tails of it," he said. Then he h=
eld up a copy of USA Today, with a blaring headline: "Energy Crisis? What En=
ergy Crisis?"=20
"We're smart enough to know better," he said.

Calpine Corp., the San Jose-based power company, said Thursday construction =
is under way for the 750-megawatt Pastoria Energy Center in Kern County.=20
Thirty miles south of Bakersfield, the $400 million project is located on pr=

LOS ANGELES -- Privately owned City Light & Power Inc., a company that opera=
tes and maintains the street lights in Long Beach, Calif., is considering ma=
king a bid for Edison International, parent company of the state's second la=
rgest utility, City Light & Power executives said overnight Thursday.
Denver-based City Light & Power could announce its intentions as soon as Mon=
day. Chief Executive William F. Simmons flew to Sacramento Thursday to begin=
 lobbying California lawmakers, the executives said.=20
City Light & Power is being advised by Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barney=
, which have valued Edison International (EIX) at $5.6 billion, or $17.18 a =
share, executives said.=20
City Light expects to bid for the entire company -- which includes insolvent=
 utility Southern California Edison and unregulated unit Edison Mission Ener=
gy -- although it could sell off some assets later. City Light & Power is in=
vestigating whether it could raise financing for the transaction, which woul=
d have to be done in cash.=20
Edison had a market cap of $4.62 billion, or $14.18 a share, at Thursday's c=
lose.=20
In 1999, City Light & Power teamed up with Enron Corp. (ENE) to support a pl=
an by City Manager Henry Taboada for Long Beach to buy Edison's distribution=
 system. The city ultimately decided instead to negotiate a better deal with=
 Edison.=20
In the mid-1990s, City Light won a $60 million contract to operate and maint=
ain the city of Long Beach's street lights for 25 years. Long Beach is South=
ern California Edison's largest service area, with 175,000 customers generat=
ing roughly $250 million a year for the utility in 1999.=20
Enron made an aborted effort to compete for retail customers in California i=
n the late 1990s. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company wasn't invo=
lved in any plan to bid for Edison.=20
An Edison spokesman said the company wouldn't comment on the proposed plan.=20

RWE May Make Bid for Azurix, Gelsenwasser, Paper Says (Correct)
2001-08-24 01:59 (New York)


     (Corrects spelling of Azurix in first paragraph.)

     Essen, Germany, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG, the German
utility that bought Thames Water Plc for $9.8 billion last year,
may bid for Enron Corp.'s Azurix Corp. water unit, Handelsblatt
said, citing unidentified people close to the company.

     Buying the U.S. company would add about 1.5 billion deutsche
marks ($700 million) in annual sales, the newspaper said. Azurix
also owns Wessex Water of the U.K., which RWE would probably have
to sell for antitrust reasons, the paper said, citing analysts.

     RWE has said it's exploring acquisition possibilities in
Europe and overseas to expand outside its home market. Still, RWE
may also be interested in acquiring Gelsenwasser AG, a German
water company majority-owned by E.ON AG, Handelsblatt reported.

     Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt, whose Thames Water purchase
last year was the No. 2 cross-border European utilities takeover,
wants to take the company beyond the German power market, where
growth is limited and increasing competition hurt earnings.



Enron May Buy U.K. Coal Mine From Liquidator, FT Reports
2001-08-24 01:34 (New York)


     London, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. of the U.S., the
top energy trader, may buy Hatfield colliery, near Doncaster,
northern England, which went into liquidation on Aug. 13, the
Financial Times reported, citing an unidentified person close to
the situation.

     The mine was due to be capped and abandoned on Tuesday, but
on Wednesday the U.K. government agreed to provide a 200,000-
pound ($290,000) grant to keep the shafts ventilated and drained
for four weeks, the newspaper said.

     Hatfield Coal Co., the private company that owned the mine,
went into liquidation after failing to obtain loans needed to
increase output, the FT said. It had been negotiating a contract
to supply coal to the nearby Drax power station, owned by AES
Corp. of the U.S.

     Enron was talking to Hatfield before it collapsed and is
still interested, the paper said. It's restarted talks with AES.
U.K. Coal Plc, Britain's biggest coal-mining company, has ruled
out buying Hatfield, the FT said.

     Britain's power industry burned 18 percent more coal in the
first five months of this year, after a 14 percent rise in 2000,
according to David Price, who edits the magazine Coal U.K.


Enron's Portland General Seeks Power Rate Increase, WSJ Says
2001-08-23 23:54 (New York)


     New York, Aug. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Portland
General is among utilities requesting that retail electricity
rates be increased as wholesale power prices drop in the western
U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported.

     Enron joins Puget Energy Inc. and Avista Corp. in asking that
prices be increased to cover the cost of supplying electricity
earlier this year, when wholesale prices soared. Lower wholesale
prices means they can't recoup those costs by selling excess
electricity they now have, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     Portland General bought power last winter for delivery in
late summer at $200 to $250 a megawatt hour, the paper reported,
citing Robin Tompkins, a lawyer for the company. Portland General
is asking for a record 30 percent increase in residential rates
and an increase of as much as 60 percent for businesses, the Wall
Street Journal reported.

     Avista is seeking a 36.9 percent increase for rates in
Washington and 14.7 percent for power in Idaho. Puget Energy's
Puget Sound Energy has asked proposed a plan to Washington state
regulators that would raise customers' bill and allow it to
recover $84 million for power bought this year.

ompany and its partners get back the full $1 billion in costs they incurred =
in building the plant.=20
"There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing a=
ny aid or assistance or other things to India going forward if, in fact, the=
y expropriate property of U.S. companies," Enron Chairman and Chief Executiv=
e Officer Ken Lay told the newspaper in an interview.=20
Enron said earlier this month that it would be willing to sell its majority =
stake in Dabhol Power Co. for $1 billion, which it said represented the cost=
s that it and partners General Electric Co. and Bechtel Group Inc. had incur=
red.=20
"If they try to squeeze us down to something less than cost then it basicall=
y becomes an expropriation by the Indian government," Lay told the Financial=
 Times.=20
Another Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said the company had not made any type=
 of request for help in the dispute from the U.S. government, nor filed a fo=
rmal complaint.=20
"We may have briefed somebody but we have not asked for any help...Nothing h=
as been expropriated," he said.=20
Palmer said Lay has not discussed the Dabhol dispute with President George W=
=2E Bush. Lay has supported Bush since his days as Texas governor and has ma=
intained close ties with him since he has been in the White House.=20
Palmer said the comments attributed to Lay in the Financial Times were accur=
ate but were made only after Lay explained at length that he believed Indian=
 authorities had every reason to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of =
both sides.=20
Dabhol Power Co., in India's Maharashtra state, has been locked in a long an=
d bitter dispute with its sole customer, a state-owned utility, over high ta=
riffs and payment defaults.=20
In a visit to India last month Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian =
affairs Christina Rocca said efforts were under way to scrap economic sancti=
ons Washington imposed on India in 1998 in protest at India's nuclear tests,=
 but she took a swipe at the country's investment climate.=20
She took India to task for protectionist trade policies, its investment clim=
ate and its failure to provide an effective system for the protection of int=
ellectual property.=20
She said the problems clouding India's investment climate could be summed up=
 with a five-letter word, "Enron". It would be difficult for international i=
nvestors to view India favorably until the Dabhol dispute was resolved, she =
said.

Energy Glut Fears Put Power Firms' Finances In Focus

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As energy industry insiders continue to fret that pow=
er generators may be building too many plants, bankers and other advisers ha=
ve begun telling power companies to take a hard look at how they manage thei=
r cash.=20
"Overcapacity" is the latest concern to befall the power industry, leading B=
arron's to suggest in a recent cover story that the country might be headed =
for an electricity glut.
Bankers working with major wholesale power companies are telling them to bet=
ter manage their assets. In particular, the bankers are taking a hard look a=
t how power companies plan to sell the power a new plant will generate. They=
're also looking at how cash is allocated to back-up credit exposure in the =
event a trading partner defaults or the market turns, as well as at how the =
companies fund projects at other business units.=20
"As the giddiness of the 'build it and they will come' mentality fades, the =
ability to finance new power plants gets a little tougher," said Gerald Keen=
an, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who specialized in energy company st=
rategies.=20
Banks are getting stingier with extending credit in light of the growing num=
ber of loan defaults, Keenan added, particularly in the telecommunications s=
ector.=20
So far, the more cautious environment isn't affecting largest power trading =
companies, but smaller energy trading companies may be having a harder time =
allocating capital among their businesses, advisers said.=20
Some of the larger firms involved in power trading include Enron Corp. (ENE)=
, American Electric Power Co. (AEP), Reliant Resources Inc. (RRI), PG&E Corp=
=2E (PCG) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK). Smaller names with less than 1% marke=
t share include Sempra Energy (SRE), FPL Group Inc. (FPL), DTE Energy Co. (D=
TE) and Avista Corp. (AVA).=20
"The internal competition for capital, which fuels the company's need for ex=
ternal capital, has been heightened by the significant amount of capital req=
uired for active energy trading businesses," said Nick Lewis, head of CIBC W=
orld Markets' power technology and growth investment banking business.=20
And though rating agencies may not do formal research on some of the smaller=
 power trading firms, they follow them enough to know the risks to these com=
panies. John Kennedy, associate director of utilities, energy and project fi=
nance ratings at Standard & Poor's said smaller trading firms often lack the=
 geographic diversity and asset bases that are associated with high credit q=
uality.=20
Cash Concerns And Transmission Woes, Too=20

The news is even more dire for online energy exchanges such as Houston Stree=
t Exchange and RedMeteor.com because venture capital has dried up for these =
firms, and the companies are not yet profitable, said Michael Walker a senio=
r manager at CapGemini Ernst & Young's energy trading practice.=20
According to industry consultants, surprisingly large amounts of capital are=
 required to build power trading businesses.=20
"The problem is the (power) market is not particularly liquid or transparent=
," said Phil Giudice, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting. He s=
aid energy trading companies, particularly the smaller ones, must always be =
careful about what market positions they are taking because the losses can t=
ally quickly if the market turns.=20
Additional risk also arises from bottlenecks that occur when transmission li=
nes make it impossible to move power from one region to another. Those bottl=
enecks also make it more difficult to assess the supply needs of a region.=20
"Increasingly, analysts and bankers are looking at companies in the generati=
on and trading business who are more sophisticated in their ability to manag=
e and optimize risk, and are viewing generation assets as financial options,=
" said David Johnson, a partner at Andersen's risk consulting practice in Ho=
uston.=20
Johnson said he expects the sophisticated traders will be the ones who will =
be successful in obtaining credit even as funding conditions become more str=
ict.=20
