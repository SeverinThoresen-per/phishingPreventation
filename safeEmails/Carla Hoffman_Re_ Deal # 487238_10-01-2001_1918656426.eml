Wait - do you mean 287238 and 287289? Or are we really talking about 487238=20
and 487239? I can't find 287289 in the system; but I want to make sure befor=
e=20
making any moves that I'm looking at the right deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that=20
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES=
=20
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding=20
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had=20
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side t=
o=20
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi.=20

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

Carla

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGE=
T=20
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price=20
should be 29.90. =20

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that=
=20
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number=20
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!
