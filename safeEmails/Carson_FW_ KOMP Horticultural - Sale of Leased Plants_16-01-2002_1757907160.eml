The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants h=
as been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased p=
lants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing th=
e plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plant=
s to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KO=
MP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, fo=
r those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase,=
 KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plan=
t (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allow=
ed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on=
 the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
=B7	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for=
 desk-top plants.
=B7	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in =
chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.=20
=B7	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building=
 Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. =20
=B7	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate s=
ticker when they are removed from the premises.=20

al.   =20
