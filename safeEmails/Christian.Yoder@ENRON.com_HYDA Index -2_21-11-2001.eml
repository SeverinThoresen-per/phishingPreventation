Monday   -2

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 20 is  -2.

The bad news contained in the 10Q did not lead to an immediate junk bond dow=
ngrade.  This implies that Mr. Banker,  who lent us the  $9b that, (surprise=

r to stay his release of the raised guillotine a day longer, permitting us, =
we hope, to withdraw our neck from the block and continue to negotiate with =
Mr. Banker for the vintage Enron "blend and extend" package.=20

llowed by a rapacious sea gull in hot pursuit.       =20
