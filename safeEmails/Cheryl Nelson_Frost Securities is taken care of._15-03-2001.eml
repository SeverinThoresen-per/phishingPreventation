Between last night and this morning, I talked to Brian Coad and figured out=20
what was going on.  The file confirms that someone in Risk Management put=20
this deal on hold in November.  I talked to Jason by phone last night and he=
=20
confirmed that this is what happened.  I had placed calls to Frost since=20
working on the project but the lawyer did not rush to call since he has been=
=20
out of the office until their business folks started pressing them this=20
week.  So, I completed a legal review & figured out what the remaining issue=
s=20
are that need to be resolved with counsel.  (One of which was a convulated=20
SEC issue that we figured out last night). I sent Brian a final draft and he=
=20
is implementing those changes in a draft for his counsel.  His counsel is ou=
t=20
of the office until Monday but Brian put us in contact.  I would predict tha=
t=20
we will settle on the final terms on Monday, make minor changes to the final=
=20
draft and get it executed by then.
