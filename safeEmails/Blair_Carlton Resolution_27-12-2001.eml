	We finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 =
dth Carlton Obligation.

	KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward.  We told KN that the=
y will have a penalty
	of $25.00 per dth for each day they did not nominate.  18 dth x 25.00 =3D $=
450/day x 3 days =3D $1350.

	We also told them we have been leaving messages since Saturday.  We left me=
ssages at=20
	3 different offices.  KN admitted to seeing the posting but "did not unders=
tand" the obligation
	and they did not call for clarification.

	If you have any questions, please let John (Ext. 7429) or I (Ext. 7637) kno=
w.  Thanks. Lynn
