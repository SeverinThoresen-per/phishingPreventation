cken is available, I'd be pleased to have him accompany me.

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.


Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung
