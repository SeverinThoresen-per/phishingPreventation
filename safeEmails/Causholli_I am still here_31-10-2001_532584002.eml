Hello Jim,

It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again. I am still=
 working for Enron, but I moved away from Oregon. Now me and my husband are =
living in Houston, Texas.=20
I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away=
 from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there. In Portland I =
wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time. I got=
 tired of that job because of shift work. This summer I joined the forests p=
roducts department and right now I do analysis for the traders. I ahve taken=
 a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take som=
e more. My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader t=
o work with derivatives but we will see what happens. Right now I am learnin=
g about the market, and how it functions.=20

I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in Houston. I nee=
d to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at=
 night after work. We will see how this goes. i have to prepare myself well =
for the future.=20

That's all on work side.=20
Moving to Houston was quite a change. The  weather especially. Right now tho=
ugh the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s. I love it. K=
oli likes Portland better. Houston is a much bigger city and a little more d=
angerous. I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school. I miss busi=
ness school at OSU and studying for finance classes. I want to go back to sc=
hool eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach. I would love to be =
a professor.=20

So how are you? How is your wife? Your kids? Is anything new happening? What=
 about your parents in NY? Are they OK from all that has happened? =20
What about OSU? Anything new there? How is prof. Moulton? Say hi to him from=
 me. What about the students? Are you still demanding of them? You know I re=
member that I put a lot of work in your classes.

We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families. My parents ask me a=
bout you all the time. They had the greatest time when they visited me here.=
=20

well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often. Let me know how=
 thigs are going with you,

say hi to your wife from me
best wishes,
Monika  =20
