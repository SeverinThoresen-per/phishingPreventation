 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in=20
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our=20
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar=20
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 %=20
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so,=20
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this,=20
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim=20
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we d=
o=20
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt
