TOWN HALL MEETING TO BE HELD WITH REPRESENTATIVE HOLT

ASME, in conjunction with AIChE, will host a Science, Engineering, and Techn=
ology Town Hall meeting with Congressman Rush Holt (D-NJ) on Tuesday, Januar=
y 22, 2002, at the Ramada Inn in East Brunswick.  This forum will provide an=
 opportunity to discuss with a member of Congress current public policy issu=
es involving science, engineering, and technology.

Registration deadline is January 16, 2002.  Contact Patti Snyder at snyderp@=
asme.org for program and registration details.


DASCHLE ENDORSES DOUBLING OF CIVILIAN R&D

Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle called for doubling of civilian R&D fundi=
ng and making the R&D tax credit permanent in a speech on the economy Friday=
=2E  Calling for a "balanced research portfolio," he noted that the National=
 Institutes of Health "should not be the sole objective of U.S. science and =
technology policy."

His speech can be found at http://democrats.senate.gov/%7Edpc/releases/2002-=
1-4a.html

STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS

ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an a=
nnual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss techno=
logy-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technolog=
y-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opport=
unities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how=
 schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and tech=
nology entrepreneurs.=20

The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.  For program and registr=
ation details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/
If you have additional questions, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisinge=
rr@asme.org.


OMB REPORT TARGETS LIST OF AGENCY REGULATIONS
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently published a report that l=
ists federal regulations (including several environmental regulations like t=
he new source review regulations under the Clean Air Act) it believes should=
 be reviewed for possible changes.

The report also compares the cost and benefit of complying with health, safe=
ty, and environmental regulations, and proposals to improve the regulatory p=
rocess.
For more information, please contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org.=20


A DAY AT THE CAPITOL TO BE HELD IN CALIFORNIA

ASME's Region IX will host the 5th Annual Day at the Capitol in Sacramento, =
California on February 5.   The program will focus on three issues: energy, =
transportation, and engineering licensing.  Visits will also be scheduled fo=
r the participants with Chairman and Ranking Members of the appropriate comm=
ittees of jurisdiction, as well as some individual visits with Assemblymen a=
nd Senators. =20

DOT PROPOSES RULE TO REDUCE EFFECTS OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE ACCIDENTS

On January 9 The Department of Transportation published the first portion of=
 a proposed rule aimed at reducing the harmful effects of natural gas pipeli=
ne accidents.=20

DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), published a note =
in the Federal Register, to define areas of high consequence where significa=
nt or considerable human or property harm would result from a gas transmissi=
on pipeline accident.

The proposal is addressing integrity management programs for natural gas pip=
elines with a two-part rule.  The majority of the rule should be published s=
ometime later this year. Integrity management refers to the periodic inspect=
ion, testing, and repair of all pipeline segments that could affect high con=
sequence areas.=20

RSPA's philosophy toward gas pipelines builds on current class location regu=
lations that require the operator to know what people would be affected by a=
 pipeline rupture.  The agency's primary goal is to protect highly populated=
 areas from a gas release.

Public comment on the proposed rule will be accepted until March 11, 2002.  =
For information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.


APPROPRIATIONS WRAP UP CONTINUED

Last week, R&D funding at the Department of Energy and NASA were detailed.  =
This month, the highlights of the FY2002 National Science Foundation (NSF), =
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Departmen=
t of Defense (DOD) budgets are summarized.


National Science Foundation

The NSF Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal Research an=
d Development, provided testimony to the appropriate House and Senate Approp=
riations Subcommittees.  The testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/=
gric/ps/2001/01-23.html
In addition, ASME joined 80 engineering, scientific and professional societi=
es; corporations; and universities in asking Congress for a 15 percent incre=
ase in the NSF budget for FY 2002, which would continue the momentum toward =
doubling the agency's budget by 2006. =20

In the end, Congress increased NSF's budget 8.4 percent ($373 million) to $4=
=2E8 billion, still significantly more than the 1.3 percent that had been re=
quested by the Administration.  Of the total budget,  $3.6 billion will be a=
llocated to the Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget line, an increa=
se of 7.6 percent, or $256 million.  Within the RRA budget, engineering prog=
rams will receive $468 million (8.5 percent), a significant boost over the P=
resident's request of $431 million.


Department of Defense (DOD)=20

For the second year in a row, the DOD Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Co=
mmittee on Federal R&D, delivered oral testimony before the House and Senate=
 Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found=
 at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-16.html

Basic Research and Applied Research, which provide a significant share of fe=
deral support for several key science and engineering disciplines, both rece=
ived significant increases in funding.  Basic Research increased 5.5 percent=
 to $1.389 billion, while Applied Research increased 12.5 percent ($459 mill=
ion) to $4.135 billion.  The Advanced Technology Development line of the bud=
get increased 11.4 percent ($457 million), for a total of $4.456 billion.


National Institute of Standards and Technology

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Task Force, of ASM=
E's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D, provided written testimony on th=
e Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 appropriation to the appropriate House and Senate Ap=
propriation Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found at: http://=
www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-10.html=20

The Advanced Technology program, which provides matching grants to corporati=
ons to fund high-risk research, was increased 26.9 percent ($39.1 million), =
for a total of $184.5 million in new funds.  Combined with carryover funds f=
rom last fiscal year, the program will have $217.6 million in fiscal year 20=
02.

While the administration had attempted to suspend the ATP program unsuccessf=
ully, it requested a significant increase (11.3 percent) for the Scientific =
and Technical Research and Services (STRS) budget, which funds the NIST in-h=
ouse laboratories and the Baldridge National Quality program.  In the final =
bill, Congress provided only a 2.9 percent ($9.2 million) increase for this =
budget, for a total of $321.1 million.
