Jim,

Sorry that it has been so difficult to connect.  I did, however, want to sha=
re with you my brief, but extremely good, work experience with Chad Landry.=20

Chad joined Enron Investment Partners a couple of weeks ago.  During his fir=
st week, he became an immediate contributor to the group by picking up the a=
nalyitical and modelling tasks needed to support a pending decision concerni=
ng an existing portfolio company.  He very promptly gathered the necessary i=
nfo and completed a model that was thoughtfully constructed and accurate.  H=
e is clearly a self starter and demonstrated a good udnerstanding of finance=
 fundamentals.  When he had questions or needed help, he asked for it.  I en=
courgage this, particularly when there is a tight timeframe, so that valuabl=
e time is not lost.  Chad has demonstrated a real interest in his work and c=
ommitment to excellence. =20

I wanted to to have these data points in preparation for the upcoming PRC me=
eting.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any addit=
ional information.

Thanks,
Barbara Paige
