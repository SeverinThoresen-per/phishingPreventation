Nominations and voting for seats are ongoing as we speak.  I assume you want=
 Charles Yeung to have a voting seat on TAC.  If that assumption is correct,=
 I will use my contacts in Ercot to try to get him the votes he will need to=
 win a place on TAC.  I have already been promised the necessary votes for a=
 board seat from the other market participants because of my participation i=
n the battle to increase the number of REP seats on the board.  (We were vic=
torious, by the way, Independent REPS now have three seats on the Ercot Boar=
d.  The other market segments will no longer out number the REPS - all segme=
nts have equal number of seats on the board.)  I'll let you know how the ele=
ctions progress.=20

The joint meeting of the Electric Restructuring Oversight Committee and the =
PUC is scheduled for December 5, 9:00 a.m. at the Capital...room E1.030. Thi=
s is the meeting Wolens discussed in the last legislative oversight committe=
e to review the progress of the pilot and final decision for opening the mar=
ket as scheduled on Jan 1.  No details of the meeting are available yet...I =
will forward them as soon as possible.  Thanks, Jean   =20

Jean,

When is the board meeting to vote? I want you to run for the spot as I think=
 the people you know and the relationships you have built with the Austin cr=
owd will benefit us.


Please let me know what is going on. Charles is up in Austin for the Thursda=
y meeting on balanced schedules and I plan to attend.

Talk soon,

Doug
