I don't see what the confusion is all about

We now live in a country where I have no President but I do have ...

1) a dead Senator from Missouri going to Congress.
2) a fake President played on TV by Martin Sheen.
3) a new Senator from New York who used to be the wife of the boss
of the man who may be President.
4) a Governor from Florida who is the brother of the man who may be
President and son of a man who was.
5) a sitting President whose wife now will be hanging around the same
men who voted to remove him from office.
6) a senior Senator from South Carolina who, under our current
Constitution rules, could be appointed to be President in this standoff
despite the fact that he is 98.
7) a potential Vice President who, because he did not take his name
off the Connecticut Senate race, could end up being the deciding
factor in how the Senate is composed.

And finally ....
8) A state where a Republican Secretary of State and a Democratic
Attorney General try to determine the outcome of 25 electoral votes
without appearing to be partisan.

Any questions? Frankly, I don't see what the confusion is all about!
