In my dealings with Accenture, they have acted as if this is the agreement t=
hat governs them.  I don't know which Accenture group is involved, however. =
 Either way, I believe that it is time for an updated agreement, with better=
 rates.  Have you been working with Global Strategic Sourcing on this?

Michelle -

This is the same agreement I referred to in my e-mail.  I understand this ha=
s been rolled to apply to the Accenture LLP group, which is a group that is =
separate and distinct from AA LLP.  If it is AA LLP's position that the belo=
w agreeement is effective, that is fine, but I am not sure this is the case.

Mark, I understand that this is a copy of the latest agreement between Enron=
 and Andersen Consulting.  I agree that a new master would be a good idea.  =
