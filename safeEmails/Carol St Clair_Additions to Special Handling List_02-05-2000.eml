Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections=20
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff=20
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if=
=20
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the "or otherwise" language in=
=20
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to gettin=
g=20
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few=20
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this=20
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening=20
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial=20
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to=20
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with=
=20
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying=
=20
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will=
=20
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z=
)=20
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation=
=20
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit=20
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex =
A=20
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a respons=
e.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an=20
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they hav=
e=20
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA=20
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.
