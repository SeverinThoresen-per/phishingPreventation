Sally,

I wanted you to know that I responded to this e-mail and I will also talk=20
with Jeff Sorenson today.  While I am here, I will meet the Weather team and=
=20
introduce myself.

Today and tomorrow are critical days as far as the Book-Split Project is=20
concerned.  I will give you an update this afternoon or when you arrive on=20
Thursday.  There is quite a lot of discussion surrounding the MTM of=20
Transmission.  We have now agreed that we should MTM all of Transmission and=
=20
not "cherry pick," and now it's how to handle the mechanics.

Talk with you soon,
Todd

I did speak with Mark and had Tim meet with him also.  Tim and Michael sat=20
together and further discussed the P&L and associated processes.  On Monday,=
=20
Tim accepted the position and I informed Sally, but obviously did not give=20
you the update.

When I return, tentatively May 15, I would like to get a copy of the resumes=
=20
which you have and will post the position again.  Thank you for holding=20
things together and after Tim has 2-3 weeks with Michael, he should be able=20
to move to Structuring.

Pencil in lunch for that Tuesday or Wednesday that I return,
Todd

I haven't heard from you lately.  Understand you spoke directly to Mark=20
Tawney.  I assume Tim Norton is a go for replacing Michael Nguyen as Risk=20
Book administrator for Weather on a full time basis.  I plan to withdraw the=
=20
job posting from the board.
