You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Flo=
rida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at D=
isney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pr=
etty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.

RECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.

Behave yourself girl.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.
