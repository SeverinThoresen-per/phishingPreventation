Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the =
updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I con=
tacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a=
 business reason and director level approval is required before any restorat=
ion work can begin.=20
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sh=
eet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales =
decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. I=
n addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track pot=
ential imbalance activity on NNG's system.=20
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the rest=
oration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can co=
ntinue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Depar=
tments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.
Thanks,
Mike
