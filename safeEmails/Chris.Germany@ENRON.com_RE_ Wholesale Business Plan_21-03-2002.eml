Just to give all some background.

We would like to understand the business plan for ENA, so that we can plan s=
taffing, etc.  For example, in Retail, the business plan is to sale the book=
s of business by May 31.  That allows us to make plans for each functional a=
rea to determine staffing gaps, etc.

We are looking for the same on Wholesale.

Chris - Can you help us with that?  If not, we will need to reschedule the m=
eeting.

Let me know.

Brenda
