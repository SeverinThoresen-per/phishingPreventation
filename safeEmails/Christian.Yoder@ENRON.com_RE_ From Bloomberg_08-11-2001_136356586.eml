I am sorely tempted to venture into remarks that would be unbecoming of the =
professional ethics I am sworn to uphold.  This is like being in the Oregon =
State penitentiary and finding out the prisoner down the cell block is a chi=
ld molester.  The regular inmates have ways of dealing with this particular =
kind of specie. Every morning,  our whole reason for walking into the buildi=
ng that houses the business establishment we toil for  is about not letting =
our business hubris get out of legal and ethical control, and now, we see th=
is.  One of our own crossed the line, a line that seems so dark and vivid no=
w, but which, in the back rooms full of   illusions of omnipotence, and what=
 one's imagination is constrained to not crystalize as the image of literal =
dope smoking,  seemed to be such an insignificant little technicality.  This=
 is a dark and wretched day for our profession. ---cgy =20
