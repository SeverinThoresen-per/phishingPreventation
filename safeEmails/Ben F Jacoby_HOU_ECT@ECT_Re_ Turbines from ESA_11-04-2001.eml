Louise:

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I'm on vacation this week, and d=
id not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon.

Brett and I have been working through our respective groups on finalizing nu=
mbers for the Ft. Pierce turbine. I expect that we should have numbers tomor=
row. The only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating=
 change orders and spare parts between the two MHI turbines which are presen=
tly under one contract. By tomorrow, we expect to have a proposed cost alloc=
ation and will then present it to Brett for his review and approval.=20

With respect to the second MHI unit, Dave Duran, Ozzie Pagan and I have a ca=
ll scheduled tomorrow to discuss the Homestead project. On the development s=
ide, we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid-May.=
 We are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two MHI =
501Fs. At least to this point, our proposed site has not raised the type of =
controversy we have experienced in Broward County.

Lastly, I wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local appr=
ovals for our Midway site in St. Lucie County. Greg Krause ( a director in m=
y group) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this. Thi=
s project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in=
 Florida.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben=20

Subject:	Turbines from ESA

As I see it, the information below outlines our current turbine position.  P=
lease could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between=
 North America and South America on the transfer of the Mitsubishi turbine f=
or Fort Pierce, we will be transferring a second turbine across from ESA to =
ENA for the Homestead project. =20

I recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for Homestead but=
 I assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we real=
locate further from ESA.

Please complete both transfers this week and let John and I know the numbers=
 at which transfer occurred.

Thanks

Louise
