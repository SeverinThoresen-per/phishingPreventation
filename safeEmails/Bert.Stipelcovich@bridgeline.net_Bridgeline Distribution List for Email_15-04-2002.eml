A new distribution list has been created in the Global Address List for Brid=
geline. In fact, it was used to send this email.  :-)
=20
It is named "DL-Bridgeline List" and is available for selection from the Glo=
bal List. We requested the name "Bridgeline" but Enron email protocol requir=
e the present format for new distribution lists.
=20
The list includes all Bridgeline personnel and will be kept current by Laura=
 or myself.

Thanks,
