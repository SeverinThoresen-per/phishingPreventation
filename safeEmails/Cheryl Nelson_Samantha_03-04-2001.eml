Mark, I forgot to tell you that I made it out to see Sam last night and to=20
give her the contributions.  She was speechless as were the rest of her=20
family members there.  She said it gave her a lot of strength to know that s=
o=20
many people care.  Sam lost a ton of weight but she is starting to eat=20
again. =20

I was talking to Tana today and Tana made a great suggestion that we get=20
together a small group to take her to lunch one day a few weeks before she=20
comes back to work.   Tana reminded me of a statement Sam made about=20
preferring to meet in small groups first rather than being overwhelmed by=20
lots of people.  So I think she might like meeting in a small group of folks=
=20
from work so that when she comes back its not the first time she sees=20
everyone. =20
