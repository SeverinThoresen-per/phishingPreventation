Thought I would get that other one off really fast before you wanted to call
and kill me!  I am so funny....I just don't know what to do with myself!

Anyway, I was downstairs a little bit ago and I could not do my hello.  She
was on the phone the entire time.  Oh well, there's always tomorrow.

By the way, picked up the picture of you and I in the suite.  It's actually =
