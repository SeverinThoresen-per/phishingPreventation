Mark, =20
I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent  me at the conferenc=

because I am flailing around wildly in  as much as I can about certain=20
Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,  =20
Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as=20
Shakespeare's, the  Catalans,  the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish=20
Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.  I=20
have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval=20
history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the=20
battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?=
 =20
I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map. =
=20
On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming=20
out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one=20
considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they=

upon the ingenuity of the Engish.  =20

Anyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back=20
into the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that =20
we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits an=
d=20
articulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those=20
policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the=20
Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of=20
it?  I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles=20
can be a little more fun.  --cgy
