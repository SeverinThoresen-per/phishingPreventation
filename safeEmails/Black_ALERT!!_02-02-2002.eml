There will be a UBSWE Migration TONIGHT....please make sure that you LOG OFF=
 before you leave today. =20

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Pass=
word.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enr=
on rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your passw=
ord, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....ema=
il will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW =
TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  A=
ll material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO document=
s or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be=
 transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbo=
x, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as a=
ccess to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thanks for your immediate help in this matter.
