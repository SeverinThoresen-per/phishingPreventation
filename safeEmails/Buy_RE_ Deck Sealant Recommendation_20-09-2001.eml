Cut the present sealant with a razor knife and remove deck.
The remaining sealant can be scraped off with a plexiglass or acrylic
scraper (this allows you to easily remove the sealant without scratching
the gelcoat).
A new light tan or beige silicone sealant can be ordered through most
marine suppliers or your local Boston Whaler dealer (sorry, no factory
direct).
Whaler uses a silicone from Starbrite Co., Whaler part# 1081694 or
Starbrite's vendor part number 82180.
Please call 1-800-Whaler-9 or check the dealer locator on the Whaler
website for the location of your nearest Boston Whaler dealer for parts
pricing and availability.

I am planning to remove the large deck plate on my 25' Whaler Revenge
(1989). There is a sealant there now. How do I remove and what is your
recommendation for a replacement sealant. I am going to replace gas
hoses, both fill, vent and engine supply. Thanks for help. Rick Buy
