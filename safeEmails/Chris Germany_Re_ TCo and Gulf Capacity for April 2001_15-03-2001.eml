Subject: TCo and Gulf Capacity for April 2001

Chris,

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be=20
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.  We have talked t=
o=20
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them:

CMD & CVA
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you. =20
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001. =20
New Power will execute it at that time.  This should happen late this week o=
r=20
early next week.

CPA
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.  Can you=20
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon a=
s=20
possible effective April, 2001?

COH
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and=20
corresponding SST contracts.  They both expire in March 2001.  Therefore=20
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.

There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH 8-35=20
Pittsburgh (K#:  67694) that should be permanently released to New Power at=20
max rates effective April, 2001. =20

There are, I believe, about seven contracts (K#'s:  68918, 68915, 69148,=20
69693, 68916, 68917, 69149) with primary receipt point(s) in the Toledo agg=20
area.  The primary delivery points are 5-2 Parma, 5-7 Sandusky, and 7-4=20
Alliance.  These contracts need to be permanently released to New Power at=20
the following rates:
 68918 - $5.171
 68915 - $5.171
 69148 - $5.171
 69693 - $5.171
 68916 - $5.181
 68917 - $5.181
 69149 - $5.181

Let me know that this okay.
