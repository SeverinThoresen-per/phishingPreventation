Liz,

I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in t=
he mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She rei=
terated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Alm=
aty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that=
 -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.  =20

This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive =
INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November =
or early December. =20

I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group. =
 What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal giv=
en your health concerns for Oksana.


Shelley
