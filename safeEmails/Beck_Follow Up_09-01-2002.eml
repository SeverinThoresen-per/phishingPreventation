Sorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears a=
nd it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.  Certainly if you feel=
 more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best f=
or you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you fee=
l is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we ha=
d never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead =
in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was suc=
h a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgivin=
g, but that was with Cindy, Richard, Brigeda, Chris and Cara staying in our =
home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to t=
he contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home. =20

What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over=
 the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with th=
e timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it =
was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising =
and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down t=
o the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a fr=
ame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and=
 have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to =
complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these t=
hings, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfo=
rtable and complete for you by the time of your visit.=20

I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay i=
n the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should ma=
ke that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be se=
t ahead of time for everyone. =20

I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to t=
ake the day off from work, and the plan was that David would join us so that=
 the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  David has taken some office =
space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we =
can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), befor=
e having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  J=
ust let us know.  --Sally=20
