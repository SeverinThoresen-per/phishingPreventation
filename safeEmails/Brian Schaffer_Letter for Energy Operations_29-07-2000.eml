Dear Energy Operations:

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to=20
express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have=20
demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.=
 =20

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go=20
forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the=
=20
best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are=20
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashe=
n=20
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will;=20
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist=
=20
us in acquiring the "necessary tools" and breaking down any "barriers."  SJB=
C=20
is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to=20
help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a=20
private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns,=20
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective=20
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with th=
e=20
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC=20
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest=20
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we=20
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it=
=20
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not=20
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts=
=20
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and=20
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that, only by=
=20
open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank=20
you.

Sally=20
