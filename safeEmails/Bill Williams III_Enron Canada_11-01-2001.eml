Group,

I wanted to passback some important feedback from the Enron Canada group=20
concerning our notes on restatements.  In the notes section of the calgary=20
website (see my previous email), we need to input the mws dispatched in EVER=
Y=20
call we have.  Enron Canada considers it very important that we have every=20
call in the log.  For example:

Entry #1; 01:33...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us up to 358 mws from=
=20
352 mws, Transalta excess energy now in merit.
Entry #2; 01:34...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 358=20
from 352 mws.

and then later on in the evening.

Entry #3; 03:21...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us down to 352 mws=20
from 358 mws, Transalta excess energy no longer in merit order.
Entry #4; 03:22...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 352=20
mws from 358mws.

So basically we need to say the time and mws for each call, and whether or=20
not the excess energy (anything over 353 MWhs) is in or out of merit.
We also need to be sure to identify restatements because of plant derates, a=
s=20
well as the cause of the derate.  This information is VERY important to our=20
custormer (Enron Canada) for settlements and payments to Transalta. =20
Consequently it should be important to us.  You should all be familiar with=20
the systems by now.  If you have any questions, please ask me.  I would like=
=20
to prove our competency on these issues.

Thank you.

Bill
