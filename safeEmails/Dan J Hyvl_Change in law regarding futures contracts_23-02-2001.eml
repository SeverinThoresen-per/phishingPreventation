Bob Bruce has set up a meeting with Ken Raceler to go over the changes that=20
went into effect 12/21 of last year.  They will meet on March 5th from 1 to =
3=20
p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.  He says that eventhough they=
=20
are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.  He=
=20
did say that space was not a problem.  I told him that you and I did want to=
=20
attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we=20
still need to be watchful of.  i.e. who is an "eligible contract participant=
"=20
under the revised law.  What representations need ot be made, if any, by the=
=20
customer?
