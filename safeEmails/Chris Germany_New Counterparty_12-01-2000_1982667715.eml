I need to have a CES counterparty set up in global please.

Customer Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP)
  12500 Fair Lakes Circle, Suite 200
  Fairfax, VA 22033-3804

I don't think CALP has assigned the contract to ENA.

I have a copy of the agreement if anyone needs to see it.

Thanks
Chris G 3-4743
