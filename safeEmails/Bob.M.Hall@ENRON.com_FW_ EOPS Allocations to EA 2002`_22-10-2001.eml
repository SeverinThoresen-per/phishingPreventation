Is this the Energy Ops schedule you are referring to?

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we c=
an provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at th=
e cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lowe=
r level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a furthe=
r allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  =
If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later w=
e can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please=
 call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is prelimi=
nary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaki=
ng it out.

Thanks,

Kevin
