John,=20

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of=
 moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone =
in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, =
in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the othe=
r tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as =
practicable, so we can facilitate the migration.=20

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resou=
rces and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through tha=
nksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be r=
econciled which would increase the cost.
