Fred:
Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:

1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe u=
s=20
for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?

2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to=
=20
us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if=20
that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchas=
e=20
Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the=20
difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco"=20
language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.

Let me know what you think.

carol
