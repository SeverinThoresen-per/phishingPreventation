Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a va=
lid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one =
summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact =
Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (=
it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cu=
t in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with =
you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this ques=
tion tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting=
 by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.=
  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and m=
yself will be around.=20

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all al=
ternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and ex=
penses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is a=
s follow.  Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organizatio=
n?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov
