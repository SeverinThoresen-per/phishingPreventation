Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which prov=
ides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my cont=
ract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, =
or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provisio=
n on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, =
as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly =
more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts an=
d mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances fa=
cing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought thes=
e last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I wo=
uld use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the re=
mainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees =
this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for m=
e to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will r=
eceive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your familie=
s face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power t=
o serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am stil=
l very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working =
with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful pl=
ace in the energy industry.

Thank you.
