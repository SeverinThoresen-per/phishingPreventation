Ben,

Went up to Philly for the holiday. Jeanne and I hung out at Gioffre's on
Sunday for the Eagles-Redskins game.  He is doing well. Spoke with JV, he is
still enjoying being single and grabbing everything he can.

We are going skiing in PA in January, and we hope to go out west sometime
this ski season.  Actually, McGrath and Dolan are living in San Fran and
they said they might get a house for the ski season somewhere.  Sounds like
a good time.

I think 'W' will pull it off.  This whole thing is a crazy mess and I can't
wait for it to be done.  Gore was actually scary last night on TV.  I can't
believe the D's nominated him as their candidate.

Let us know if you are coming to DC. Talk to you later.

Luke

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away
for Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5
sisters.  M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since
college - pretty scary.  If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming
to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should
diffinently get together.  I will work on that when the time comes.
Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into
complete retirement with all this contesting.  How is everything going?
What are you guys doing for the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to
do some skiing in Beaver Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all
is going well and I'll be better next time about getting back to you.  Good
to hear from you!
Ben
