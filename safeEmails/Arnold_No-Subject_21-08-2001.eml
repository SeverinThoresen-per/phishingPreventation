With the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is s=
acrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time s=
haring of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize th=
is tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their comp=
uters all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one mess=
age every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what co=
unterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Informat=
ion we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if=
 we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.
