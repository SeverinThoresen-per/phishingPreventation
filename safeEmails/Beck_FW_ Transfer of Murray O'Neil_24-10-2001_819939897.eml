I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of =
senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that M=
urray was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.=
  I asked Christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in Houston=
 this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't =
on the list.  Does he report to you?  Hope that I didn't start a series of e=
vents that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had =
been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records w=
ere not correct.  --Sally=20

Murray should report directly to Beth Apollo in SAP.   I was made aware of t=
his today by Christina Valdez.   Would you please forward a SAP Web Based Fo=
rm indicating the change in supervisors for Murray from Tim Belden to Beth A=
pollo as soon as possible and let us know when the form is submitted so I ca=
n confirm that it has been processed into the system?
Thanks for your help in this matter.
