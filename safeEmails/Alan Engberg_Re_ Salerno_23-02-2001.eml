It appears that this deal, once complete will be approximately $80k=20
positive.  The value of litigating is primarily in maintaining discipline in=
=20
the industry regarding the enforcability of financial contracts (as opposed=20
to physical contracts were the current norm is for a buyer to walk from his=20
contracts whenever he perceives the availability of a better alternative).

Andrew/Britt - can you please provide an estimate of what sending this=20
message will ultimately cost in legal fees?

Thanks,
Alan

How does this deal look now in light of the surprising recent price increase=
s=20
in PE?  Are the projected cash flows worth pursuing at this time?

I just wanted to provide you with a quick update on this matter.  We sent a=20
demand letter to Salerno about a month ago, but have heard nothing. I have=20
made several calls to Salerno's Bob Lampo, but he will not return my calls. =
=20
Therefore, we are preparing a lawsuit, which we will file here in Houston.  =
I=20
have asked Britt Davis in the Enron Litigation Unit to prepare the lawsuit. =
=20
Alan, I have told Britt to give you a call if he has any questions.

Truth and justice will prevail.

Andy
