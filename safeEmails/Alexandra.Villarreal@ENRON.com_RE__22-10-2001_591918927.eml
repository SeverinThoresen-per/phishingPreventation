You do not have to apologize to me.  I understand completely.  It is stressf=
ul for me as well.  I hope your little friend doesn't bother you too much.

By the way, if you don't feel like picking me up at the dealership I underst=
and.  It is a fairly long drive for you.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we wer=
e going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my room.=
  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you came =
by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i guess=
 i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get me w=
rong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.  i th=
ink it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over though.  th=
ey probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me who was =
feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but i dont r=
eally want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i still feel so=
mewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at my house - a=
nd with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel strange.   l=
ike this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy being with yo=
u,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attached.  i am sor=
ry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thing you need to =
hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are - and you probabl=
y dont know what your plans for the future are as your marriage is concerned=
=2E  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for an answer or expl=
anation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand where i am coming fr=
om.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that i am experiencing=
?

i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my lit=
tle friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.   i=
 feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to know=
, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

well i hope that the rest of your day goes well.=20
