3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
	Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of=
 which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron beli=
eves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate rese=
rves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items,=
 individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact o=
n Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County Distr=
ict Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Housto=
n Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defen=
dants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs=
 were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts=
 with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was =
severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) se=
parately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defend=
ants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =
"Panhandle program," a special marketing program established in the early 19=
80s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the =
Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enro=
n Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase=
 contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other produce=
rs' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a=
 class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texa=
s Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was imprope=
r and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the P=
laintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including =
the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have str=
ong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.=
  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate reso=
lution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its finan=
cial position or results of operations.

	On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Building =
in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily inju=
ries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Comp=
any, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distrib=
ution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. E=
nron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named =
as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico A=
queduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultant=
s Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numero=
us lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and=
 the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful d=
eath, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly c=
aused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cau=
se of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate further that issue, =
but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether ea=
ch plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful=
 damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agreed on a fund for se=
ttlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases i=
nvolving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the United States District=
 Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have yet been scheduled for=
 trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron be=
lieves that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materia=
l adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE)=
 ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility=
=2E  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a gene=
ral rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining in=
vestment in Trojan.=20

	The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigat=
ion in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeal=
s and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the =
OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Uti=
lity Board (CUB).

	In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of t=
he OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment=
 in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from=
 the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Tr=
ojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements o=
f the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE=
's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers,=
 either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of o=
ngoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agr=
eements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's withdrawal, th=
e URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.  The=
 URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and=
 the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its invest=
ment in Trojan.=20

	Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances =
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters w=
ill not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results =
of operations.

Other Contingencies
	Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and lo=
cal environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require =
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the oper=
ation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.=
  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result i=
n increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not =
expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results =
of operations.

	Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remedia=
tion on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur materi=
al expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

	Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for whole=
sale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a comb=
ination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in availa=
ble hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-reliance on t=
he spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California's regu=
latory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but fro=
ze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs=
 of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public utilities=
, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Compa=
ny (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certai=
n obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase c=
osts and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have defaul=
ted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations,=
 including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (=
the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System Operator (the In=
dependent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities.  In addition, PG=
&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptc=
y.

	Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation =
in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in =
restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiative=
s are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible t=
o predict their outcome at this time.

	Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities,=
 the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energy in=
 California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of thes=
e entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities and b=
elieves that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and ot=
her credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to d=
evelopments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involv=
ed, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predict=
ed, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact=
 on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

	India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol Powe=
r Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constructin=
g an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasificati=
on facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its invest=
ment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-recours=
e to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electrici=
ty Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Government of M=
aharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors o=
f payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power pur=
chase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The contract disput=
es relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity=
 and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI to sa=
tisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents and (b) MSEB=
's statements that MSEB has "rescinded" the PPA and MSEB is therefore no lon=
ger bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Phase II lenders ha=
ve stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the constructi=
on contractors have terminated the construction contracts for non-payment.  =
There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to i=
ts favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settl=
ement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in clear violat=
ion of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pursue all available lega=
l remedies under the project documents.  As a result of these disputes, the =
740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB.  Further, Dabhol h=
as suspended construction activity on Phase II.  Enron does not believe that=
 any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact =
on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.
