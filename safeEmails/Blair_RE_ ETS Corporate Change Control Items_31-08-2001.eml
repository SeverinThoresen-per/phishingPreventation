Is there a reason why the work on September 4th to the VPN can not be done d=
uring the normal maintenance window provided for this type of outage?
This outage is presently planned during core business hours and ETS Customer=
 Service has Home Office Workers that gain access through VPN. This will cau=
se them not to be able to provided our customers with any assistance.=20
