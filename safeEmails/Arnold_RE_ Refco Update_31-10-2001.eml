Gentlemen

We met last week with their management and CTO. We have determined the hardw=
are and software requirements for the deal.  We are in the process of drawin=
g up a term sheet and proposing a financial structure.  We have set a meetin=
g for Nov 12 in NYC to get into the details of financial terms and structure=
=2E

The deal is going well and we are working with the following hi-level parame=
ters:
Initially 8 Nymex look-a-like-products: Natural Gas (prompt, prompt+1, promp=
t+2), WTI (prompt), Gasoline (prompt, prompt+1), Heating Oil (prompt, prompt=
+1)
2 customer buckets with different spreads and volumes: Institutional and Ret=
ail
Volumes for Institutional will be 1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and=
 0.2 contract possibly to match Nymex mini concept, Volumes for retail will =
be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match Nymex mini concept
Data feed with price and volumes sent from EnronOnline to Refco system custo=
mized and powered by EnronOnline software
Initially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers, 500 sim=
ultaneous
Refco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral wi=
th Enron
Refco will pay Enron a one-time license fee for a 3 year contract with an ad=
ditional annual maintenance & support fee
Enron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and Refc=
o will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held.

Obviously, the above parameters are the preliminary thoughts and subject to =
change and negotiation.  We are just beginning to model the potential revenu=
e and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come =
out of this exercise.  There are also a number of alternative technology sce=
narios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with.

Please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments.

Regards

John Cummings
