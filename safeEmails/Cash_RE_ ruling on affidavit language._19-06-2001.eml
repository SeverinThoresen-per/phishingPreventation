That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If s=
o, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could c=
ontact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquir=
ed.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, partic=
ularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company throu=
gh Novarco.

We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see=
 if that approach still is warranted.

Novarco (one of the companies identified on John Ashman's affidavit as a han=
ds off account) is being aquired by a company that is not on the list.  Ther=
e is some language in the affidavit (3c1) which appears to extend the list t=
o the companies identified and their "subsidiaries, affilitates, heirs, and =
assigns"; would a buyer be considered one of these?
