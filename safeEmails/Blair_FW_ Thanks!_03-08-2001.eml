	Shelley, I thought I would pass this on to you.  It is not too often we get=
 to pass on good comments.
	I will include this info in the year end reviews as well since we are still=
 working on the report Ken refers
	to.  Also this is another example of why we need a business objects person =
in our group or connected
	with out group.  Thanks. Lynn

I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the =
TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as I've worked--and strug=
gled--on the TW Daily Balancing Report. I have made repeated phone calls to =
Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the gro=
up as I've tried to understand TMS and TW's systems and scheduling peculiari=
ties. I have worked with Amy Mulligan, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, Christine=
 McEvoy and Bert Hernandez.

In particular, I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been =
especially helpful in my endeavours. Bert and I spent many hours on the phon=
e discussing TW's scheduling intricacies. He has been very patient with me a=
nd always made himself available to me to answer my questions. He was able t=
o discuss in great detail many TW transactions, including why and how transa=
ctions appear the way they do, and what the transactional data means. He eve=
n went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions aros=
e, rather than referring me to someone else, and never failed to follow-up o=
n a question I had.

In short, I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help.

The report is still being finalized, but Marketing and Gas Control have alre=
ady employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline=
 activities. Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizin=
g information from the report, and the Commercial Support and Financial Acco=
unting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work.

Again, I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in=
 the development of the report, and I wanted to give them the appropriate re=
cognition. I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP,=
 lest I forget. I also believe that good news shouldn't wait. We don't alway=
s hear enough of it!

Thanks again!
