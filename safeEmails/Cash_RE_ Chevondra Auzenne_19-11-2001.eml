I agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain.  This has g=
one on too long.

This is really great news!  I think that we need to let her know that Dale i=
s interested in having her transfer to his group but we still have the outst=
anding issue of the promissory note.  We need to let her know that she needs=
 to take care of that matter or she will not be able to retain her employmen=
t with Enron.  Since she has had it for quite some time we need to give her =
a short window to comply.  What do you think?

Valeria/Michelle -  Chevondra was offered a 30-day trail period working for =
Dale Neuner and if she was successful in her efforts, then she would have an=
 option to officially transfer to Dale's department.  The trial period was c=
omplete as of November 15th and Dale has contacted EGM HR requesting the tra=
nsfer of Chevondra into his group.

However, there was a contingency in Chevondra's transfer.  She was to sign a=
 promissory note (for outstanding personal calls on a company cell phone), a=
s well as return the company cell phone.  Shanna and I are unaware of  the c=
ell phone or the signed promissory note being returned at this time.=20

Could you please provide the recommended next steps? =20
