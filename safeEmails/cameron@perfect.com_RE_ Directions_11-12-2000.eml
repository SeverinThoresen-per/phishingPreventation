Can we do a little planning tonite for this weekend?


Cameron:

Here are the directions to the place in Stinson.  Can you email to your
invites?  Did you invite John E?

We have the place from 5 PM on Friday evening till 10 AM on Sunday morning.

Address:
11 Sonoma Patio
Stinson Beach

If you're coming from the City and take Panoramic over Mt. Tam, then when
you hit Highway One, make a right and head north toward town.  Go through
town and make a left on Calle del Arroyo.  If you see the lagoon on your
left, you've gone too far.  After making a left on Calle del Arroyo, make a
left on Sonoma.

If you're coming from points North, then you'll be heading south on Highway
One toward Stinson.  After you've passed the lagoon on your right, you'll
eventually come to Calle del Arroyo.  If you arrive in the town of Stinson
Beach, you've gone too far.  Make a right on Calle del Arroyo, then a left
on Sonoma.
