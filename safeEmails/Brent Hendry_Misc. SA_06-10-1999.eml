Sara,

I hope you are having a good vacation and are not looking at your emails=20
until you return.  I just wanted to get you up to date on a couple of items.=
 =20

Bolivia--Randy asked if we have ever done any research on whether we could d=
o=20
derivatives in Bolivia.  I told him I thought we had checked on this and=20
determined that Bolivia was not one of the countries that  had been surveyed=
,=20
but that I would check with you to be sure.  I think he is asking since we=20
are looking at doing physical deals there and the next thing the business=20
guys always want to do is financial trades. =20

Colombia--There is a new group of commercial guys who want to do electricity=
=20
trading (and gas trading???) in Colombia.  I have passed this request on to=20
Mark who is looking at it.  I think we will run into the same problems we ha=
d=20
last year with the gas trading proposal.  Susan Baily found the Colombia=20
financial and physical trading survey for me to give to Mark and I faxed som=
e=20
other memos I found in my files here.  There is a lot of memos on structures=
=20
that had to do with the earlier trading vehicles and joint ventures which I=20
did not send.  I also did not send the memos relating to our efforts to get=20
financial trading allowed.  Bob Carter worked a lot on that issue but the=20
commercial interest died before we saw any tangible results with the Colombi=
a=20
political process.

Brazil--Don lobbed a bomb last week to Randy and then casually mentioned it=20
to me after the fact.  Don asked Randy to set up a swap vehicle in Brazil so=
=20
that Don can do his financial trading with Argentina from Brazil.  This is=20
some speculation on my part but I think Don doesn't like the current=20
structure of having to run his financial trades with Argentine counterpartie=
s=20
through Houston.  He does not have the ability to direct and control the=20
process of negotiating and trading for Argentina through ENA which is=20
problematic for him since for tax reasons we are telling him anything of=20
substance has to come from ENA in Houston.  Don asked Randy, who asked Andre=
a=20
Bertone, to set up a swap vehicle in Brazil to trade with Argentine=20
counterparties.  Obviously Don could control the negotiating and trading fro=
m=20
Brazil and his operational problem is solved.  As you know this may create a=
=20
whole host of other problems that cannot be solved as easily.  I will discus=
s=20
with Andrea today my initial thoughts on the issues raised by this=20
proposal.   First the tax issues may make Brazil a difficult place to make=20
any money on a trading operation, tax will need to be brought in first thing=
=20
to analyse the structure.  Second, we may not be able to trade cross border=20
swaps without regulatory problems, we will need to speak with Antonio Felix=20
and others at Tozzini to start reviewing the structure.  Third, there may be=
=20
significant currency issues involved that need to be reviewed at the same=20
time we look at the tax and regulatory issues.  If we are able to overcome=20
these issues then we will need to review the substantial legal and=20
operational issues raised by such a structure.  The ISDA agreement, which=20
would be in English, would need to be reviewed by local counsel to ensure=20
that all of the substantive provisions including arbitration, limitation of=20
liability and collateral structures would be enforceable in Brazil when=20
entered into with Argentine counterparties.  Operational issues such as who=20
will be responsible for the negotiation of masters, drafting of confirmation=
s=20
etc. would also need to be addressed.=20

Argentina--I think the Acindar swap issue has gone away.  Pat emailed though=
=20
that they are now looking at an option structure.  I do not know what they=20
mean by "option" or what the new structure would be.  I will let you know=20
what I find out.

Call when you get back and I can update you on where things stand.

Brent
