OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES=20
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this dea=
l=20
in Sitara with a zero volume.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool). =
=20
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production=
=20
or pool gas on CNG?
