Dear All,

I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office=20
during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be=20
available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Tradin=
g=20
and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go=20
through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation,=20
probably on Monday.

TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES
It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarne's team to help=
=20
us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in=20
trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves=
=20
and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity=20
desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly=20
forward volatility curve have been developed.

ORIGINATION:
Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts=
)=20
etc. perhaps with Didrik.

ENERGYDESK.COM
To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com=20
systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the=20
discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for=20
this I hope to meet with Trond).

EXOTIC OPTIONS:
If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which=20
should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.

I will be in the Oslo office from Friday afternoon, and available all day=20
Monday and Tuesday.  I will be staying at the Grand Hotel and probably=20
contactable on my mobile: 07747 86813.

Look forward to meeting you soon!

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. I will be contactable on my mobile for any urgent queries from London=20
customers: 07747 868131, or reachable through Catherine/Maret (x2570)
