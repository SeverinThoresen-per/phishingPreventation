Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal=20
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005,=
 allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days p=
rior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 mill=
ion, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a cha=
nge of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to=
 the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if =
the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," ac=
cording to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he=
 became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.
