 can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and v=
isiting portland every few weeks

Louise,
=20
On reflection, when I sent you my HR team list yesterday, I made decision in=
 order to get within 9, I would cover Portland and Calgary HR from Houston. =
Before we proceed on the basis of that team I need Chris and Tim to agree th=
ey are ok with this. Milnthorp says he's happy, so long as estate or our new=
 parent provides payroll and benefits services (which I believe they will).
=20
I would be happy to keep Julie Kearney on my list but I really don't know if=
 I can drop one of the others which would obviously push my team to 10 overa=
ll (this is down from 14 or 15, depending on which list you look at)..
=20
David
