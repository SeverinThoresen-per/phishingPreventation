As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically address=
es Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems =
and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To=
 that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the "Op=
erational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeting th=
is commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Ser=
vices, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson. =20

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is=
 to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improv=
e the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines =
for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our=
 challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure t=
o operational risk.  =20

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operationa=
l risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of t=
he business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal,=
 for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or re=
port card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, =
as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication o=
f risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative asse=
ssments and quantitative measurements. =20

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team=
 has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
=09
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  T=
his approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to =
identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with=
 a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmatio=
n that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, Cr=
editAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the abili=
ty to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsh=
eet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuation m=
odels and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor interco=
mpany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report=
 variances=20
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational=
 risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team. =20

Thanks,

Rick Buy
