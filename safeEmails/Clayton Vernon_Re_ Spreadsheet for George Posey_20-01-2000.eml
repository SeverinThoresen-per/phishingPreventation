Vince-

Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.

First off, it appears from the data that a special "appeal" for fund giving=20
was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps=20
tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating=
=20
obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression=20
analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:

giving this Sunday =3D $4403

+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since=20
Jan. 5, 1997)

+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order=20
autoregressive effects)

+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas

+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999

- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday

- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving

- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)

The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3=20
years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for=20
2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.
