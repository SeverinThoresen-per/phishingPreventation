FAA OPENS MOST CLASS B AIRSPACE TO VFR

AOPA KEEPS FOCUS ON REMAINING CITIES, SPECIALTY OPERATIONS
The FAA on Sunday afternoon released a notam announcing the phased reopening=
 of 12 more "enhanced Class B" (ECB) areas to most VFR operations. Last week=
, most VFR flights were allowed to resume in 15 other ECB areas. This leaves=
 three metropolitan areas-New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Boston-where =
VFR remains prohibited.

"This is an important milestone and fantastic news for VFR pilots," said AOP=
A President Phil Boyer. Restoring VFR flight in ECB airspace has been an AOP=
A priority for weeks. "But now our focus must turn to restoring operations i=
n the three remaining metropolitan areas and in getting the news and traffic=
 reporters, banner towers, and other specialty operators back in the air eve=
rywhere."

Much like the release of airspace last week, this release will be phased in =
over three days. The first five will be reopened on Monday. The opening will=
 follow the schedule below:

Monday, October 22, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Atlanta, Georgia; Las Ve=
gas, Nevada; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida, and San Francisco, Cal=
ifornia.

Tuesday, October 23, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Denver, Colorado; Detro=
it, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San =
Diego, California.

Wednesday, October 24, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Chicago, Illinois, an=
d Orlando, Florida.

The procedures for these cities are the same as those established for the 15=
 areas opened last week. Aircraft flying in enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace =
must have an encoding transponder and squawk 1200 (or as assigned by ATC). A=
ircraft without a transponder must get a waiver from ATC for each flight in =
ECB airspace. If equipped to do so, pilots flying in ECB airspace should mon=
itor the guard frequency of 121.5 MHz. The notam also asks pilots to operate=
 their aircraft in a "normal" manner, avoiding aerobatics as well as circlin=
g or loitering.=20

See AOPA's "frequently asked questions <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsite=
ms/2001/011019faq.html>" for more information on rules applicable to enhance=
d Class B airspace.

The full text of Sunday's notam is below. While this is an official FDC nota=
m, AOPA recommends that pilot check the latest notams prior to any flight op=
erations. In recent weeks, some notams have been modified repeatedly or resc=
inded. AOPA will continue to post updates promptly on AOPA Online <http://ww=
w.aopa.org/>.
