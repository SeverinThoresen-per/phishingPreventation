I spoke with Ed sacks, our credit person, about the form of LC that your=20
credit person circulated.  We both agreed that the LC form for the EEI Maste=
r=20
and the ISDA needs to be the form that we attached to the drafts that have=20
been sent to you given that the drawing conditions match the LC language tha=
t=20
is in each Master.  Please talk to your credit person about this and let me=20
know if this is okay.
