Stephanie, I just want to follow up on the fuel supply discussion we had for=
=20
FAPSA (the paper plant in Mexicali).

I would like to recover the cost of the gas pipeline, which I'm including in=
=20
the capital costs of the plant, through a fuel supply agreement that we can=20
mark to market.

The ideal terms would be for 20 years, an Index price plus SoCal transport=20
price, plus $0.22 / MMBtu to Enron project company for an amount of=20
approximately 3000MMBtu / day.

I look forward to receiving a draft copy of a standard fuel supply agreement=
=20
so I can familiarize myself with standard market LD terminology.

Thanks,
Matt
