In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  T=
here are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headc=

EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we ar=
e meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These busines=
s units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our m=
eetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW b=
udget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures f=

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations =
to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, R=
isk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are provid=
ing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than tha=
t provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informe=
d choices regarding the services that they receive. =20

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review =
in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of=
 these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and Octo=
ber 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to fin=
alize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions =
to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT M=
aintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been =
included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as w=
ell.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in ind=
ividual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001=
 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to b=
e relevant. =20

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital do=
llars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (produc=
ts or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular =
level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business. =20

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates =
licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail =
on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, lin=
e of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital s=
pend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize=
 IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on w=
hich projects to undertake in 2002.  =20

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to fi=
nalize them,  please call one of us. =20
