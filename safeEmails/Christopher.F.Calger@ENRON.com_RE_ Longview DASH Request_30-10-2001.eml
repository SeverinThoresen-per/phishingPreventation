Louise,

Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-N=
ext banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contra=
ctual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, bu=
t we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following=
 clarifies:

Cash Payments to Date:=20
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067

Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when th=
e vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones

Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150=
K=20
  =20
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the requ=
est at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equi=
pment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make=
 sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before=
 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inc=
lusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 mill=
ion in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 mill=
ion (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in ca=
ncellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material r=
ecovery potential for money spent.
