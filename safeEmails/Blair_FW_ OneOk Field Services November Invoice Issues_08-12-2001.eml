I've talked with Vernon.  I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of to=
wn 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with =
Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max o=
verrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff=
 exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-=
to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month. =
 If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may hav=
e to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than t=
he deal permits.

Affects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently en=
tered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the fir=
st 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.
In practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual=
 path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16=
A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6=
000.

Another Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up =
to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For exam=
ple, on 108489, MDQ=3D73,500 so 5%=3D3675.  Is it your intention to discount=
 only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=3D110=
,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?

Rita,

Not to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contrac=
t for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).  So the=
re is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized ov=
errun classification. =20

I wouldn't want to do a discount because of "full rate equivalent" issues. I=
 like the exception better with a note in a file or something to explain it.=
  But I defer to Steve on this.

Importance:	High

Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma

1) just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated =
incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box.
2) I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in q=
uestion, setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate.  Then it would not=
 look like a discount.  However, there is no way to attach a comment to an e=
xception.

Considerations:
The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount (but this is=
n't really a discount).
The discount (but not the exception) would show up on the 592 report - but n=
obody reads that, anyway.
When they nominated as max rate overrun, it got scheduled.  Since they had a=
 right to firm service, they would have been scheduled if they had nominated=
 correctly, so they didn't really get an unfair advantage over other TI.

Steve & Dari - what do you think?

Lynn,

Earlier this month, I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominate=
d 100% of their firm commodity as overrun.  I pointed this out to Joe Linhar=
t and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month.  Joe informed=
 me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior t=
o that date couldn't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier=
 for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out co=
rrectly.  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC man=
dated reporting, I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best =
solution either. =20

Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we =
have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity=
 invoices go out on the 10th?

Thanks!
Vernon
