Scott,
Legal's position is exactly as Rob Cass explained on his email below. You ca=
n=20
also confirm it with whether Gerald Nemec x33512 (he created both, GTC &=20
P. Desc.) or  with Mark Taylor.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks,
Carlos

Subject: Re: New Product Type: US Pipeline Capacity Release =20

I believe that it would be Legal's position that we not ignore the reference=
=20
to the "General Terms and Conditions" since it serves as additional terms to=
=20
the "special terms" of the transaction.  GTC's allow for resolution of=20
payment failure, force majeure, liability, etc.  To include it in the=20
description guarantees that those terms are included.  Without the inclusion=
,=20
the product description would have to be expanded to include many (if not=20
all) of the terms contained in the GTC. =20

Eventhough the transaction may not be "confirmed," the Counterparty may elec=
t=20
to request the GTC at any time.  Reason?  The GTC resolves potential=20
conflicts and defines the rights of the parties.  The counterparty may not=20
necessarily require a confirmation.

Ultimately, Legal will need to approve the action if the GTC is removed from=
=20
the product description, but I would be interested to know on what basis the=
y=20
would allow the GTC to be dropped from the description.  These are my=20
thoughts (recommendations?).

The product description specifically designates a GTC -if we are not=20
confirming the transactions should we make this reference?  Other than that,=
=20
it seems ok.  For those that have not been involved in the discussions, this=
=20
type of transaction will not bridge automatically from EOL to Sitara.  It=20
will have to be monitored and entered manually.  Since this will be a=20
capacity release deal, the pipeline contract number that we a releasing will=
=20
be a crucial piece of information when entering the transport capacity deal.
