Lynn,

On Aug 14, Ranelle Paladino told me that Dari and herself would be preparing=
 a letter to terminate the Mountain Energy contracts due to their inability =
to demonstrate creditworthiness.  I was suppose to receive a copy of the let=
ter by now.  I will contact Ranelle.

FYI

As you know, Mountain Energy Corporation, a shipper on NNG, filed Chapter 7 =
bankruptcy.  They have three small reservation invoices each month totaling =
together less than $2000 per month. =20

Per Dari Dornan's instructions, I mailed them a certified letter to demonstr=
ate creditworthiness on July 12.  Mountain (or someone) did receive the lett=
er on July 18 and did not respond to Paul Cherry nor I by July 26, as stated=
 in the letter.

Ranelle Paladino and Dari will working with Michele Winckowsi in Certificate=
s to terminate these contracts.



Larry
