Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to he=
lp follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cy=
cle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is di=
fferent on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocatio=
n is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule v=
olumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confir=
ms.=20

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting U=
nsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operatio=
nal available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after ea=
ch cycle.=20
Please let me know.
Thanks Ramona
