Tom,

The only active spreadsheet we have right now in the East is POWER-SS-R1B-PR=
C.  The POWER-SS-R3B-PRC will be zeroed out tomorrow....the option actually =
ended in August, but the spreadsheet was never zeroed out and re-entered int=
o RiskTrac, so that last day's position is still sitting in RiskTrac. =20

The time frame between 7 and 11 a.m. in AdHoc is irrelevant because once we =
calc in the afternoon (which "writes" daily info to AdHoc), the AdHoc table =
should not change until we calc the following afternoon.  You can be sure th=
at you will only capture the previous day's historical data unless IT is doi=
ng some sort of testing and it utilizing AdHoc.  This happens very rarely bu=
t when it does, we will make sure to keep you in the loop.

Let me know if you have further questions!
Thanks!
Casey

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak =3D (20,162), Off-peak =3D (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11=
AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not =
as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we =
be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current d=
ay's?

Thanks.
-Tom

I was incorrect about Alberta ENA, it should be zero but where is Alberta?  =
It should have a big position.

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective dat=
e 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to gen=
erate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct?=20
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other=
 names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom
