Louise:

I know this is a difficult time for Enron given the incident at Teeside, but=
 I wanted to let you know that Principal Investments actually has an investm=
ent in a company called Serveron (www.serveron.com) which makes a product th=
at monitors transformers for risk of failure.  This product/service may be a=
 worthwhile investment at our facilities given the unfortunate accident of t=
oday and our desire for a superior safety record.

Regards,

Charlie
