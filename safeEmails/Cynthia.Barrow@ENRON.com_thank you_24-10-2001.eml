Before the day gets away from me, I wanted to once again tell you how much I=
 truly appreciate you and your dedication to our company, shareholders and e=
mployees.  You did an outstanding job today.  You caused tears in my eyes du=
ring the last employee meeting and today when you shared your heartbreak rel=
ated to what we are now going through my heart again went out to you.

There is so much I could say, but I think to sum up how I feel is simply to =
state again that I appreciate you and value your integrity, commitment and h=
onesty.  I know there is probably so much you wanted to say, but for sound b=
usiness reasons simply can not share today.  To be honest, I did walk away n=
ot fully motivated for the next struggle.  It is not a lack of trust, confid=
ence or commitment, but it is simply a natural human response to another blo=
w to our reputation that simply takes time to fully absorb and then move on =
in a postive and productive manner. =20

You and all of Enron are in my prayers and I know that God will continue to =
keep his hand on you (and us) and guide us all through yet another personal =
growth opportunity.

Respectfully
Cynthia Barrow
Sr. Director of Benefits.
