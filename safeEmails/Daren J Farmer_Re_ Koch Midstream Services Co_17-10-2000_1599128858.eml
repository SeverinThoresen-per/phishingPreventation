Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say=20
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I=20
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the=20
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the=20
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard=
=20
back from anyone.=20

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this=20
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can=
=20
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets=
)=20
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You=20
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct=
=20
contract in place for the deal.
