If you have any questions on the El Paso Electric stuff that we have just im=
plemented, please let me know.

We will be making a monthly physical annuity for the Scheduling fee

Kathy from EPE has requested that it not be a separate line item on the invo=
ice, just blended in with the rest of the amount owed.

Thanks,

Cara
