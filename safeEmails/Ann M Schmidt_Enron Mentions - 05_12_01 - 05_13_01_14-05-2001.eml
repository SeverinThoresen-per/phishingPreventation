Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random=20

Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to=20

advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.
Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular=

Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with=20

This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affec=

Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's=20
economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting=20

Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two=20

Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice=20

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation=20
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to=20
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base.=20
The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated=20
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston=20
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to=20
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live whereve=
r=20
they choose.
Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn=20
enrich the lives of every Houstonian.=20
"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interest=
s=20
of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management=20
executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future.=20
A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force=20
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have=20
discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20=
=20
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized publi=
c=20
education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and=20
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of=20
successors.=20
The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role=20
in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of=20
business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined.=20
"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital o=
f=20
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of majo=
r=20
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of=20
Houston," the report states.=20
"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly=
=20
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter=
=20
how benevolent those leaders might be."=20
The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most=20
successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned=20
Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer,=20
president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president=20
and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the=20
Greater Houston Partnership.=20
Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the grou=
p=20
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf.=20
"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool=20
around with something that is ill-conceived," he said.=20
Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts wh=
o=20
advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's=20
work could be very influential.=20
"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the=
=20
part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life,=20
Klineberg said.=20
The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as =
a=20
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier=20
business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan=20
said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the=20
center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future.=20
Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people=20
representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day,=20
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various=20
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston=20
scenarios.=20
James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined=20
in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not=20
necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However,=
=20
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said.=20
In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and=20
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop=20
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases t=
o=20
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power.=20
Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air=20
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large ta=
x=20
rate increase.=20
Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the=
=20
gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a=20
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year=20
hardship post on the way to something more desirable."=20
Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational syste=
m=20
by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational=20
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in tur=
n=20
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in=20
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007.=20
These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to=20
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school=20
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or=20
technical training programs.=20
The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they=
=20
would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and=20
federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent=20
on more traditional educational programs.=20
In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's=20
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that=20
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically=20
competitive.=20
These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable=20
city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and=20
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and=20
public transport in corridors that delight the eye."=20
Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate=20
pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range=20
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street=
=20
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rai=
l=20
lines extending in various directions.=20
To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome=20
their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt=20
"new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city=20
centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the=20
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city."=20
Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy."=
=20
The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turn=
s=20
its energy toward diversifying the economy.=20
The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its=20
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology=
=20
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly=20
become significant global players.=20
The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key element=
s=20
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city=
=20
in which to live and conduct business."=20
Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees=20
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such=
=20
as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to=
=20
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said.=20
Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce=20
results as soon as possible.=20
"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a=20
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway=20
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the=20
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute.=20
"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure=

that we educate these kids for our future."

"It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore."=20
Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the=20

transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The=

t=20
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally.=20
"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating,=20
drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things=20
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on=
=20
a boat."=20
Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, =
a=20
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and=20
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a=20
limo does on land.=20
Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the=20
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiter=
s=20
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can=
=20
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake.=20
Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a=20
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in=20
Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business=20
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M=20
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981.=20
But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat=
=20
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water.=20
In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of=20
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism=
=20
or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners,=20
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take=
=20
to float his idea.=20
Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150=20
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the=20
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay.=20
"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five=20
feet deep in places, he said.=20
Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan.=20
"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober=20
said. "They had no confidence.=20
"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank=
=20
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got an=
d=20
tell me what it needs,' " he said.=20
Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week=
,=20
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort=20
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a=20
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.=20
After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel=20
Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60=20
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar=20
engines on the boat.=20
Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving=
=20
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St.=20
Clair.=20
Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.=20
The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but=
=20
it didn't prepare him for marketing.=20
"I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent=20
$125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that=
=20
he called "a total flop."=20
Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as=
=20
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell=
,=20
he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a=20
time.=20
Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental,=20
insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave=
=20
once," he said.=20
Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and h=
e=20
got one: target marketing.=20
He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used th=
e=20
boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate=20
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate=20
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy=20
Mills mall.=20
"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi=
=20
Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif.=20
"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before.=
=20
Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back."=20
Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Sta=
r=20
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth,=20
the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of=20
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still=20
undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober=
=20
adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future.=20
"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the=20
other boats," he said.=20
After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting=20
everything back into the business.=20
The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.=20
But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers.=20
"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they=20
prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said.=20
It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector=20
screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that=
=20
some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other=20
locations on the Houston Ship Channel.=20
If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneat=
h=20
the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor=20
causes the player to bounce.=20
Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from=20
the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star=
=20
Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements=20
for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a=20
major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's=20
stanchions into palm trees.=20
And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats=
=20
instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being=20
honored at a recent floating awards banquet.=20
Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back.=20
"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first=20
cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something=20
different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they=20
usually want to do it again."=20
But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered=20
boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards=20
dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.=20
About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent=
=20
corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company=20
has chosen to have with Star Fleet.=20
Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that=20
Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are.=20
"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he=20
said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, jus=
t=20
one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake,=
=20
there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can=
=20
actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor=
=2E=20
So people have to be reminded."=20
He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can affor=
d=20
cruises, Lober said.=20
"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare=20
our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities,=20
country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And=20
our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut=20
corners."=20
Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax=
=20
and gratuities.=20
Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his=20
crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with=20
some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras=20
beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks.=20
"We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the=
=20
best and give it back to them."=20
Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's=20
business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make=20
their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real=20
opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three=20
boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers=20
moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375=20
guests.=20
But one boat can still do a lot of advertising.=20
At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were=20
slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Sta=
r=20
Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they=20
were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him.=20
As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barg=
e=20
under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes -=
=20
the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star=20
Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment.=20
It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from=20
school years ago, Lober says.=20
And he's going to live at the top.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity=20
Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s=20
(ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute=
=20
over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu=
=20
said.=20
In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact=20
that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power=20
price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.
A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with=20
representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another=20
meeting May 23.=20
Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours.=20
"I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first=20
meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There=20
has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the=20
meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a=20
meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes,=
"=20
Prabhu said.=20
Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron=20
Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly=20
maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving=20
issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open=20
offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract."=20
The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricit=
y=20
from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9=
=20
billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs.=20
A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel,=20
recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated.=20
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.=
=20
Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=3DINR46.8825) a kilowatt-ho=
ur=20
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers.=20
The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial=20
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer,=20
failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is=20
working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of=20
excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of=20
the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.=20
The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a=20
revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt=20
naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron=20
has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second=20
phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plan=
t=20
will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002.=20
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest=20
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General=20
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.=20

buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp.=20
While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leader=
s=20
showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea.=20
"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this=20

government could run a utility as efficiently as a business.=20
DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership=20
would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway=20
corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would=20

Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the=20

And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't=20
necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks=20

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the=20
state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs.=20
The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber,=20
who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.
PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000=20
customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many=20
Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets."=20
DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and=20
have the utility operate as a public power entity.=20
He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission=20
rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources.=20
"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be=
=20
feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation.=20
Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility.=20
Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion,=20
citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political=20
environment in the West.=20
Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private=20
utility, as long as it would benefit consumers.=20
DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public=20
ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville=
=20
Power Administration's hydropower.=20
The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature.=20
"Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons.=20
"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a=20
bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue."=20
Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large=
=20
businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generatin=
g=20
plants.=20
Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the=20
Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job=
=20
like a utility purchase.
