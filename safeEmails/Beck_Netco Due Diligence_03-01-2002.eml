Big Pig:

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   Th=
e CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction. =
 I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years a=
go.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transactio=
n flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the incre=
ased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in trans=
action flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a=
 summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted a=
gainst the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included i=
n the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy=
 Zipper to provide to the CFO? =20


UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the =
numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you=
 had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled=
 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that h=
e was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level=
 of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily=
 in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas =
Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here=
 in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight tha=
t he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI.=20
