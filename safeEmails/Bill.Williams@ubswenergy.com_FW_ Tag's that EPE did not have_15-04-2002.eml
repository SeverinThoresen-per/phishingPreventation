There were 3 tags that EPE gen did not have, I circled them and filed them u=
nder the 15th in the acordian file.  They were amended after EPE's preschedu=
ler went home.  Just wanted to let you know.  It took 45 min. of time to ver=
ify with all parties and this time I needed to work on other things since 4c=
5 was up and down all night and we lost neman 3, copper and 75 coming in fro=
m IPC throgh the peak pretty much all at once.  My notes are in the drawer o=
n the right of the rt desk if you need to look at them, it's a yellow pad.  =
Just wanted to keep you informed.  Call with any questions. =20
