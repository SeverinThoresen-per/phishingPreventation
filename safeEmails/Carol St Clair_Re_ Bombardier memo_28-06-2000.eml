Carol,

I left you a message last week regarding the enclosed letter.  You asked to=20
see a copy...

Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help=20
sell snowmobiles.  Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various=20
retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardie=
r=20
if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of=20
the previous 3 years.  In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of=20
snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a=20
predetermined premium for each unit sold.  In return, Enron was liable for=20
potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different=
=20
payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were=20
sold in each city).

The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by=20
the various weather services.  As of this date, we were responsible for=20
payouts in 6 cities.  We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.

Current Issue:  Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, o=
n=20
our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city=20
covered under our contract with them.  They plan to forward this letter to=20
the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.  The impetus=
=20
for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the=
=20
strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be=20
entitled to a rebate.

Here is the letter:


Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.

Regards,
Gary Taylor
