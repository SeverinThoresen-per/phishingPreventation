Wind energy is hardly back in the doldrums that nearly devastated the sector=
 in the middle of the 1980s.=20
Most of the world has agreed in principle to a version of the Kyoto climate =
accords, and the European Union has approved its long-awaited directive, alb=
eit in a watered-down form, aiming to double the use of renewable energy. Me=
anwhile, growth rates in the industry continue above 20%, and even laggard c=
ountries from England to Brazil to India say they will step up investment in=
 new wind farms.
So why isn't the outlook for Europe's big wind turbine makers rosier?=20
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein last week downgraded Vestas Wind Systems, the=
 world's leading turbine maker, citing slower growth rates next year, even a=
s Morgan Stanley Dean Witter got bullish, upgrading its recommendation on De=
nmark-based Vestas.=20
Meanwhile, despite good first-half results for Gamesa SA, Credit Suisse Firs=
t Boston trimmed the target price for the Spanish company to 28 euros from 3=
0 euros. (The stock finished last week at 24.66 euros) Who's right?=20
"They all are, in a way," says Robin Batchelor, who heads a renewable-energy=
 fund for Merrill Lynch. A short-term slowdown looks inevitable, but "things=
 are looking quite favorable for the group, especially with some version of =
Kyoto and the EU directive," he says.=20
In part, the three leading turbine makers -- NEG Micon of Denmark is No. 3 -=
- are victims of the bursting technology bubble. Valuations that looked cons=
ervative in the middle of the technology craze now seem expensive. Vestas, a=
t last week's closing price of 359 Danish kroner (48.24 euros), trades at a =
ratio of 48 times its projected earnings for 2002, more than double the aver=
age ratio of stocks included in the Euro Stoxx 50. Even Gamesa, which trades=
 at a discount due to its lower-margin aeronautical business and more limite=
d international presence, wields a 2002 price-to-earnings ratio of 26, highe=
r than that of most companies included in Madrid's IBEX-35 blue-chip index.=20
The stocks are paying the price, even if they have weathered the storm bette=
r than most telecommunications or technology companies. Over the past three =
months, shares in Vestas have slipped 3.7%, Gamesa stock is down 2.2%, and N=
EG Micon shares, at 353 Danish kroner (47.43 euros), are up 3.6% though they=
 were battered in July.=20
"The outlook's not negative, but it's not fantastic, either," says Adrian Co=
xson, a London-based analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "The share pri=
ces imply growth rates that simply aren't there."=20
Growth rates in the industry had topped 30% annually since 1999 as wind powe=
r made a comeback, driven by a renewal of government subsidies, from its nea=
r-death experience the decade before. Vestas, which makes about 30% of all w=
ind turbines sold world-wide, saw its sales rise fivefold between 1997 and 2=
001, while bottom-line profit rose 20-fold. Gamesa went public last fall wit=
h Spain's most successful initial offering in the past two years; Vestas hol=
ds 40% of its wind power division. And even Nordex, a German manufacturer, h=
as rebounded from a dismal April debut on the Neuer Markt to post one of the=
 year's biggest turnarounds.=20
But now, it seems, the glory days may be past. Saturation in such key market=
s as Denmark and Germany has limited growth forecasts and prompted regulator=
s to take a closer look at wind power's subsidies. It also has helped spur a=
n ecological backlash -- environmental groups oppose wind power, arguing it =
kills migrating birds and spoils the landscape -- already familiar in Englan=
d, Ireland and Spain, and compelled the industry to start building offshore =
wind farms, which are still unproven and more expensive than the onshore ins=
tallations.=20
Meanwhile, in the U.S., the world's second-biggest wind market, after German=
y, question marks still surround the renewal of the Production Tax Credit fo=
r wind farms. Analysts expect wind power to take a breather next year in the=
 U.S. after a record-setting 2001, when about 2,000 megawatts of capacity ar=
e due to be installed, as much as in the previous 20 years combined.=20
Add to the mix growing competition from Enron Corp.'s wind division and hint=
s that big electrical engineering firms like ABB and General Electric Corp. =
are poised to start making turbines themselves, and it is no wonder that Eur=
ope's turbine makers are desperate to find a new growth recipe.=20
Analysts expect the industry to grow between 20% and 25% annually over the n=
ext five years, bringing world-wide capacity from about 17,700 megawatts at =
the end of 2000 to around 53,450 megawatts by 2005. But few think France, It=
aly or other countries newly won over to wind power will take up the slack f=
rom the coming slowdown in Spain, Germany and the U.S.=20
Which puts the onus on the likes of Brazil, North Africa, India and China --=
 all of which need new sources of electricity. Bu unlike Western Europeans, =
these countries aren't prepared to offer generous subsidies to promote clean=
 generation.=20
"We're moving from environmentally driven markets to electricity-driven mark=
ets," says James Stettler, a renewables industry analyst with Dresdner Klein=
wort Wasserstein in London. "That's the kind of landscape you want to see, w=
ithout government subsidies."=20
Those subsidies have created juicy returns (between 15% and 20%) for wind-fa=
rm operators. In large part, that spurred an excess of wind turbine installa=
tion in Germany and encouraged a storm of proposed new wind farms in Spain. =
But operating margins for wind power will be cut to the bone as the technolo=
gy is forced to compete on equal terms with natural gas and coal-fired plant=
s.=20
And that in turn requires larger, more efficient turbines that can operate a=
t full capacity even in areas with lower wind speeds. That's bad news for NE=
G Micon, once the world leader and still recovering from a bankruptcy scare =
that followed troubles with its products' gear boxes and a series of poorly =
digested acquisitions in 1999. For starters, the company won't have ready un=
til the end of next year a turbine using pitch technology, which maximizes e=
fficiency by adjusting blade angle depending on wind conditions. And the fas=
test-growing segment of the market is for turbines between 1.5 megawatts and=
 two megawatts, which aren't NEG Micon's strong suit.=20
Gamesa won't be selling a 1.75-megawatt turbine until next year, but for the=
 windy and wide-open Spanish plains, that isn't a problem over the short ter=
m. Gamesa's biggest headache is its relationship with Vestas, which provides=
 it with crucial technology but severely limits its international expansion.=
 Recent contracts in Greece and China -- outside of Gamesa's original deal w=
ith Vestas -- may have been one-time deals, and analysts fear Gamesa will ha=
ve trouble compensating for the industry's slowdown in Spain with aggressive=
 international expansion unless the agreement is renegotiated.=20
Vestas looks well positioned to take advantage of a move into new markets. I=
t has been using pitch technology for 15 years, and has a two-megawatt machi=
ne in production. Last year, a quarter of its 870 million euros in sales cam=
e outside the core markets of Scandinavia, Germany, Spain, and the U.S.=20
But analysts are afraid next year's dip in the U.S. market will slow sales g=
rowth at Vesta to 8% or 9%, after revenue grew an estimated 48% this year an=
d 37% last year. And its market-leading position has given Vestas a premium =
valuation, which could work against the stock in the medium term.

Bush stance on greenhouse gases prods interest in state controls=20
By BILL DAWSON=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Environment Writer=20
If Texas ends up with state regulations to curb emissions blamed for global =
warming, President Bush will be partly responsible.=20
Bush's opposition to the Kyoto Protocol's international mandates for reducin=
g carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is being credited with renewing =
interest in cutting emissions -- not just among environmentalists but also i=
n Congress and some U.S. corporations.=20
Meanwhile, a study that Bush's state appointees ordered last year, while he =
was governor, promises to stir debate over the need for a Texas greenhouse-g=
as plan. This analysis is to be completed at the Texas Natural Resource Cons=
ervation Commission in December.=20
"Hopefully, we'll present meaningful options of how the state could move for=
ward," said TNRCC Executive Director Jeff Saitas.=20
The state's engagement with the issue has far-reaching implications. Oil and=
 other fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide. Environmentalists say energy-dep=
endent Texas would rank as the seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases =
if it were an independent nation.=20
Tentatively, officials working on the TNRCC study have calculated that about=
 80 percent of the state's greenhouse emissions come from power plants, othe=
r industrial plants and transportation activities.=20
The three Bush-appointed TNRCC commissioners decided to undertake the study =
because Texas environmental groups petitioned them for a plan to cut greenho=
use gases. The environmentalists timed the request so state law would requir=
e a response during last year's presidential campaign, when Bush's environme=
ntal record was being criticized.=20
Instead of introducing a plan, however, the commissioners asked for recommen=
dations about how Texas could help fight global warming.=20
Saitas said TNRCC officials may conclude that new state actions specifically=
 targeting greenhouse emissions are not warranted, because pollution-cutting=
 efforts already under way are also eliminating a large volume of these gase=
s.=20
In any event, environmentalists are planning to campaign for a formal state =
program, complete with new regulations, to achieve extra cuts in greenhouse =
emissions. The Legislature authorized such rules in 1991.=20
Environmentalists will team up this fall with religious and other groups to =
sponsor public meetings where citizens can present ideas for a Texas greenho=
use-gas plan, said Tom "Smitty" Smith, state director of Public Citizen.=20
"There are clearly a number of things the state could do by rules," he said,=
 "and hopefully we want this to become an issue in the next governor's race.=
"=20
The Sierra Club's state director, Ken Kramer, said Bush's stance on the Kyot=
o pact, and the absence of an alternative proposal by his administration so =
far, appears to be backfiring. Despite U.S. opposition, the treaty was endor=
sed by 178 nations last month in Bonn, Germany.=20
"An ironic aspect of President Bush's failure to come to grips with the glob=
al warming issue is that other people, who definitely see this is something =
that can't be ignored, are rising to the occasion and putting in extra effor=
t because they can't rely on the present administration for leadership," Kra=
mer said.=20
Others see evidence that this reaction is emerging nationally -- and in some=
 unexpected quarters.=20
One is Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change=
, which sponsors a coalition of major businesses. The group, which includes =
Houston-based Enron as well as oil giants Shell and BP, calls the Kyoto pact=
 "a first step" in acting against global warming.=20
Claussen said she was afraid the administration's hard-line opposition to th=
e Kyoto treaty might encourage some companies to pull out of the Pew Center'=
s Business Environmental Leadership Council, but it seems to have had the op=
posite effect.=20
The Bush team's stance not only helped catalyze the agreement on the treaty,=
 but it is now inspiring wider U.S. congressional and corporate interest in =
limiting greenhouse gases, she said.=20
"We really do have the president to thank for that," Claussen said.=20
Last month, for instance, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Foreign Re=
lations Committee voted 19-0 for a resolution that called on Bush to develop=
 specific ideas for a binding climate treaty when negotiators revisit the is=
sue this fall. It said the United States should act "to ensure significant a=
nd meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from all sectors."=
=20
This latest chapter in the U.S. debate over global warming has again exposed=
 the divisions among leading energy companies on the subject, many of which =
are based in Texas or have extensive operations here.=20
"It's definitely a live issue," said Jeffrey Keeler, director of environment=
al strategies for Enron, a natural-gas and electric-power company that is al=
so involved in renewable energy sources like wind power.=20
The Bush administration, he said, will "have to get a plan together and real=
ly have some details."=20
Natural gas produces less carbon dioxide than oil or coal, and Enron regards=
 efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a business opportunity.=20
In contrast, Exxon Mobil's outspoken opposition to the Kyoto accord is often=
 seen as a reflection of its self-described position as "the world's premier=
 petroleum and petrochemical company."=20
In 1997, Exxon's chairman told leaders from developing nations they should n=
ot worry too much about global warming and increase use of fossil fuels.=20
But one top official said the company now believes "there is a substantial r=
isk of climate change having adverse results, and we very much favor strong =
action to address those risks."=20
The "most appropriate actions" are technology improvements and other energy-=
saving measures, like Exxon Mobil's cogeneration projects, said Frank Sprow,=
 the company's vice president for safety, health and environment.=20
While there are clearly "practical issues" at stake for different energy com=
panies -- with some believing they can benefit from mandated cutbacks in gre=
enhouse gases -- their differences on the issue "are more philosophical than=
 anything else," the Pew Center's Claussen said.=20
"You ask (energy industry) people off the record if the world is going to en=
d up addressing the issue and constraining carbon," she said, "and most say =
yes."=20
The TNRCC study will estimate the reductions in greenhouse gases that will o=
ccur because of pollution cuts Texas has already ordered. They mainly includ=
e new TNRCC rules to reduce smog in Houston, Dallas and other cities, as wel=
l as associated emission limits the Legislature set in 1999 and 2001.=20
Carbon dioxide is not a smog-forming gas itself, but it can be reduced as a =
result of some actions taken to lessen pollutants that do form smog -- switc=
hing to fuels that emit less carbon dioxide or increasing energy efficiency.=
=20
Texans should focus on the economic benefits of energy efficiency, said Jurg=
en Schmandt, director of The Woodlands-based Mitchell Center for Sustainable=
 Development, a research organization founded by oilman and developer George=
 Mitchell.=20
Energy-saving measures will be especially important in this state if a U.S. =
"carbon tax" is ever enacted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Schmandt sa=
id. "I believe an argument can be made that a place like Houston, with its h=
eavy concentration of refineries, needs to be better prepared than the rest =
of the country."=20

POWER PRIVATISATION: REFORM UNPLUGGED

Copyright 2001 Living Media India Ltd

All's not well and it is going to get worse. The much-admired power reforms =
in Orissa have come unstuck barely six years after they were hailed as a bea=
con for the rest of the country. Instead of bringing light and prosperity, t=
he reforms have spelt gloom, bitterness and uncertainty. Privatisation was s=
upposed to end the subsidy regime and stem transmission losses. So far it ha=
s resulted only in heavy losses, unhappy consumers and acrimony among the pl=
ayers.=20
Matters came to a head last week when AES Corporation, the US power major th=
at has a 49 per cent stake in the Orissa Power Generation Company (OPGC) and=
 a 51 per cent stake in CESCO, the distribution company for central Orissa, =
threatened to pull out. Dennis Bakke, AES president and CEO, in a terse pres=
s statement, warned of drastic measures. The message "enough is enough" sent=
 Orissa in a tizzy.
This is not the first time that the private sector players have pulled the p=
lug. In May this year, the managing director of a power generation company s=
witched off its generating stations to pressurise the government-owned GRIDC=
O into clearing its dues. The Government in desperation sought to bring abou=
t order by threatening to arrest the managing director. The bad blood contin=
ues to linger.=20
Foreign power companies locking horns with state governments is nothing new.=
 Enron's Dabhol Power Company feud with the Maharashtra government has run o=
n for years. But the hostility and distrust among Orissa's power players go =
a step further. The AES has initiated arbitration proceedings against GRIDCO=
 for non-payment of dues and has threatened to pull out of CESCO if tariffs =
are not increased. With CESCO losing several crores every month in high cost=
s and low tariffs, the implicit message is loud and clear: AES is not into c=
harity and it cannot be expected to lose perennially.=20
The fact that the power corporations are still in the red after six years bo=
des ill for the privatisation process. Orissa was the only state to privatis=
e distribution. Generation was partly privatised with AES picking up a stake=
 in OPGC. The four distribution companies-the AES-owned CESCO and the BSEs-o=
wned NESCO, WESCO and SOUTHCO for different zones of the state-were to buy p=
ower from GRIDCO, collect tariffs from the consumer and pay GRIDCO, which in=
 turn had to pay the generating companies, including the OPGC. All this and =
more was envisaged by the Orissa Electricity Reforms Act of 1995 that saw th=
e unbundling of the government-owned state electricity board. But the ground=
 situation now presents an entirely different picture.=20
Instead of a chain of supply and payment, it has become a series of losses a=
nd non-payment. The distribution companies have begun to crack the whip on c=
onsumers, disconnecting power lines in case of non-payment. But these distri=
bution companies themselves owe GRIDCO around Rs 800 crore. They claim they =
are still in the red. AES's CESCO owes Rs 250 crore but that has not deterre=
d AES from initiating legal proceedings against GRIDCO for the Rs 160 crore =
it owes OPGC. "When CESCO pays us, we would square up with OPGC the next day=
," says GRIDCO Chairman Priyabrata Patnaik.=20
While the war of attrition is on among the players in power sector, the publ=
ic is ready to retreat. The general feeling is that the reforms have failed.=
 "Enough is enough. It's time that the reforms process is rolled back," decl=
ares Janardhan Pati of the CPI(M). Angry consumers ransacked the CESCO offic=
e on learning that it is still to pay its dues to GRIDCO despite charging hi=
gher tariffs. With reforms making a bigger hole in the consumers pockets, th=
e reformists are on the defensive.=20
Breaking away from the subsidy regime was bound to be painful. The Rs 250-cr=
ore annual subsidy was supposed to be offset by cutting down on distribution=
 losses and improving collections. But it's not going as per plan. The priva=
te companies are defaulting on payments to GRIDCO, which as a result is reel=
ing under liabilities of over Rs 2,700 crore. "The power business here has g=
rown into a very complicated affair," admits R. Mishra, finance director of =
GRIDCO. "=20
The whole episode puts the reforms in a quandary. If AES walks out, it will =
be difficult to find someone to fill the breach in CESCO. While monthly powe=
r bills amount to Rs 52 crore, CESCO manages to collect only Rs 40 crore. An=
d if salaries and other administrative costs are added, its losses mount to =
more than Rs 12 crore.=20
Privatisation, however, has not been a total loss. The reforms have already =
yielded results: Andhra Pradesh pays over Rs 1,500 crore annually to prop up=
 its power sector, while the Orissa Government pays not even a rupee. Revenu=
es also flowed in when the companies paid several hundred crores of rupees t=
o get licences. The stumbling block which threatens to overturn the reforms =
is that the distribution companies are unable to cover their costs. Reformis=
ts say that it would balance out eventually when transmission losses are min=
imised and the collection goes up. The immediate need is that the private pl=
ayers like AES must keep their commitment of bringing in capital.=20
Recent developments have put a question mark on AES's role. Even the World B=
ank that goaded the state onto the reforms track has not delivered on its pr=
omise. It had foreseen a 5 per cent reduction in transmission losses every y=
ear, but after six years losses are still high at 43 per cent. From being a =
model in power sector reforms, Orissa's experience is now a lesson on how no=
t to go about privatising the core sector.
