(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan=20
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the "credit book" (identified in=20
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of=20
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about=20
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not=20
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we kno=
w=20
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the=20
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need=20
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a=20
Securities Loan Agreement?
