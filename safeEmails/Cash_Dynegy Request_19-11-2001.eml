David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment=
 law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protoc=
ol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of empl=
oyees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have=
 to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-a=
ll.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be t=
he ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourk=
e's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group w=
ants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do y=
ou know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am c=
oncerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with ext=
reme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this. =20

Michelle
