Drew, I won't be available until around 5pm today.  In lieu of a meeting let=
 me leave you with some comments.

=B7	I have no objection to the "special test" being conducted at the CEESI f=
acilities in Ventura, Ia.  As far as I know they are adequate. But, we would=
 want to have an expert look at them first.  i.e., Instomet and Ken Cessac.
=B7	When a meter is removed from service at the Rich/Lean Inlet/Outlet then =
the Rich/Lean plant(s) would have to go down until that meter is tested and =
reinstalled.  I would assume that they would want to have one outage for all=
 four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days.
=B7	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
=B7	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If O=
neOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would b=
e willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct t=
his test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an o=
utage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's =
letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to "cooperate" =
with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues w=
e will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the =
meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the stand=
ards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for t=
oday if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off=
 this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF
