Subject: HPL Optimization

Team,

As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of=20
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will=20
position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.  Our=20
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and=20
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate=20
pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the=20
optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron.=20

The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our=20
Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing=20
operation of HPL.  Our origination strategy is to leverage our business=20
operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing=20
skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodit=
y=20
opportunities on the gas/power grids.   We need our current employees to=20
accomplish this objective across N. America.

We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the=20
Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting fo=
r=20
processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the=20
Gulf Coast.  Our recent efforts to provide services such as business=20
operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third=
=20
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunit=
y.

It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our=20
competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related=20
matters with third parties.  Please come see me if you have any specific=20
questions or concerns.  Also please refer any third party inquiries regardin=
g=20
HPL to Tim Determing.

Regards,
Brian
