Due to popular demand, an Excel worksheet has been created in the famous=20
Phonelist workbook (thanks Teri and Lisa!).  When you update the Cost Center=
=20
list, the numbers on the Cost Distribution tab will automatically update. =20
This further reinforces the importance of keeping that Cost Center list=20
current.

If you have any other ideas or suggestions to add, all the better!

Thanks for your patience,
Anna
