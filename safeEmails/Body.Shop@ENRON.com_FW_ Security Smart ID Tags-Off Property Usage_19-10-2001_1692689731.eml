To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to th=
e building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body=
 Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Phot=
o ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who=
 participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tag=
s are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply sl=
ide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the t=
ag closed. =20

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members ar=
e exercising off property as well as provide the security identification ver=
ification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exerci=
se outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to=
 the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Y=
our Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the=
 Front Desk at the end of your visit. =20
