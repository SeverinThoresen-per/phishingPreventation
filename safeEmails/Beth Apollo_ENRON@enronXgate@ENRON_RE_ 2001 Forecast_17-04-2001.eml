Kerry  -- We need to be forecasting $1mm under plan for the whole of Energy =
Ops for the year.  That goal was set for us during the plan process last yea=
r, and we intend to hit it.  (Just make sure the plan number you are using w=
as not already reduced)

Take the amount we were under for Q1 and the difference between that amount =
and $1mm and apply it ratably to the remaining 3 quarters.

If you want to sit down for a few minutes and discuss, I am happy to do it. =
 At a minimum, I would like to review what you have down for us before it is=
 final.

I am available from 2 to 3 today, or at 5

Let me know
Thanks

Beth

We are in the process of looking at the expenses and allocations to other bu=
siness units that we are expecting for each of ENW's groups for the remainde=
r of the year.  Our basic approach is to start with Plan and see what change=
s we think need to be made based on 1st quarter trends or anticipated change=
s (e.g. headcount).  I visited with Brian Heinrich the other day and he indi=
cated that he felt that Plan for the remaining quarters was a good forecast =
for the remainder of the year.

I just wanted to make sure that you were in agreement and that I should use =
Plan numbers for Energy Ops in the remaining quarters in my analysis. If not=
, since we are on a very tight time schedule, I would like to sit down as so=
on as possible to see what changes should be made.=20

Thanks,
Kerry (x5-4895)
