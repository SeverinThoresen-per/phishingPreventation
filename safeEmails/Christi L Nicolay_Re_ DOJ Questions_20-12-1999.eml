Sarah,

I haven't heard back from Jade yet.  Beginning to think she is on vacation. =
=20
In any case, looking at the questions below, I think #2-3 shold not be=20
problematic for us to answer; seems like #4 is irrelevant; and #1 will be=20
sensitive.  In any case, I will touch base with Jade (on a general basis) an=
d=20
contact you as soon as that happens.  If Michelle calls again, please tell=20
her to feel free to call me in the interim.  I met her briefly about a year=20
and a half ago and she may remember me.  Thanks.

Lara

Subject: DOJ Questions

Lara:

Here are the questions posed to us by DOJ (the attorney I spoke with is=20
Michelle Cano - Jade Eaton is the lead attorney)

1. Markets that Enron is trading in

2. More information about Enron's request to become a control area in ECAR

3. Transmission constraints

4. Enron's plans for sale of power from its new plant in Illinois Power's=20
service territory.

In addition to these Enron-specific questions, Michelle also discussed more=20
general issues about the AEP/CSW merger such as whether AEP's ownership of=20
coal-fired generation combined with CSW's ownership of gas-fired generation=20
will give the merged company market power

Christi told me that Enron is not planning on building a generator in=20
Illinois Power's service territory in the near future, so we are confused by=
=20
DOJ's reference to this plant.

Christi is in the loop on this issue also, so please include us both on=20
emails or phone calls.

Thanks for your help Lara.

Sarah
