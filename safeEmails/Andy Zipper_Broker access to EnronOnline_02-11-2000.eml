Let me try and be clear on this, as I'm not sure if you are waiting for me t=
o=20
make a decision on this, or vice versa:

1). Energy operations believes, as per yesterday's conversation, that the=20
vast majority of errors on broker trades are caught in the check out with th=
e=20
broker and end of trading day.

2). Enron is currently taking the risk on brokered trades of errors in=20
showing up many days/months after trade confirmations go out.

3).The brokers we are willing to offer this product to are ones that we have=
=20
had a long and stable relationship with.

Having said all that I'd like to make the following decision:

The margin we hold is to protect for the event that we have a bust with 1).=20
At Trade date plus three days we assume that any errors the broker may have=20
made have come to light, presumably through counterparty letting us know tha=
t=20
our confirm contained an error, and that any subsequent problems are between=
=20
Enron and Counterparty. We can ask to have margin cover all outstanding=20
trades that were generated by broker, but I can't for the life of me=20
understand why anyone would sign that, as we are Enron already takes that=20
risk and we are not even going to be paying them brokerage.

If this presents problems for you let's discuss.

Thanks
Andy
