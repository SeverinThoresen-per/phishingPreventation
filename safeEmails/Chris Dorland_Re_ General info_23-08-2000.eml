Hey Dad and Chris,

How's it going? I was just wondering if I could ask for you and mom's help o=
n=20
a few things before the end of the summer. First, I want to start advertisin=
g=20
my Jeep for sale, so I was hoping you might spruce it up a bit for me. It=20
just needs a good cleaning inside and out (i.e. Lazerwash) before getting it=
s=20
picture taken for the ads. Also, the sticker on the rear window should be=20
removed and it probably wouldn't hurt to have it Mr. Lubed one more time.

There are a couple of other things, but I think you said not to worry about=20
them: Windshield is very cracked and tint on back window has a scrape on it.=
=20
Don't worry about $$$ because whatever it costs you, I'll reimburse you from=
=20
the proceeds.

I was thinking I'll list it in the Red Deer and Calgary Auto/Canada Trader=20
magazines. If you call them, they set up an appointment with you to take a=20
picture and get the vehicle listed. I have their phone numbers in both Red=20
Deer (346-1969) and Cowtown (250-2122), but I think we should get the surfin=
g=20
machine tuned up first.

Second, I was hoping I could get a few things sent out here asap. As I=20
mentioned before, I want to get involved in some adventurous stuff on the=20
weekends, if possible. I found that I can take my Advanced PADI scuba here i=
n=20
one weekend, so I was hoping to get my fins, mask, snorkel and booties sent=20
out here. I think they are in the basement.=20

I would also love to get that box of movies from Chris and my golf=20
clubs/shoes, si possible. Don't worry about the golf clubs if they are a=20
hastle though b/c I probably wouldn't use them more than once or twice.

I hope this is not a big inconvenience to you guys. I just wanted to get the=
=20
ball rolling on this before the summer's end.

Thanks alot and I'll talk to you soon,

Dan
