Hi Julie, I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with.  I have =
a=20
new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have=
=20
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a=20
total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter =
#=20
9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the=20
deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and=20
he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  I=
n=20
order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???

Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )=20
