Folks,=20

Had an idea to get together this weekend at the casa and maybe watch a littl=
e football, shoot some pool, drink some wine (or beer), and 'whine' about En=
ron. Who knows when we'll all get together again, so anyone up for a Sat nig=
ht down South of town?

Let's hear some interest out there!

Brad
