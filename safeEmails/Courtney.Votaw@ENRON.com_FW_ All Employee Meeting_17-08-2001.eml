Courtney:  I am not sure if you can help me with this but I wanted to try an=
d find someone that could help.  At today's all employee meeting during the =
Q&A,  someone asked a question about Enron's involvement in Mexico.  The lad=
y that responded to the question mentioned that they are looking for good pe=
ople to staff the Monterrey, MX office. =20

I looked at the Enron jobs listing but found no entries for Mexico.  Do you =
know how I could find out more about opportunities in Mexico?  If you could =
give me a name or number that would be great.  (I have no idea who my HR rep=
 or if he or she would know anything about international positions).

Thanks,

Phil Villagomez
