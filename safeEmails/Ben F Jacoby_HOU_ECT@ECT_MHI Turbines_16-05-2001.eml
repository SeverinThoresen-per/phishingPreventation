John:

Louise, Dave and I discussed the management of the MHI turbines the other da=
y, and Louise seemed to be leaning toward joint management by Wiggs, Calger =
and me. Duran and I would like to know where we stand on this, as our respon=
se to Brett on the Ft. Pierce unit will change depending on how the units ar=
e to be managed on a going forward basis.

Dave and I would like to meet with you tomorrow to discuss this and our Midw=
ay, FL peaker. I will contact your assistant to determine when you're availa=
ble.

Regards,

Ben
