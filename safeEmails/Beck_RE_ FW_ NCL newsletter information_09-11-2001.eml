Exciting news on the house, but I know that you must be busy!  When we moved=
 to Champion Forest, we did the same thing.  Called the real estate agent to=
 list our house on a Monday, got a contract on our house on Tuesday, and put=
 a contract on our new house on Wednesday that week.  You and your husband m=
ust be into quick decision making as well!! =20

Yes, life at Enron is interesting these days.  Kind of like a soap opera.  D=
ifficult for everyone to stay focused.  We are ready for some good news here=
=2E=20

With your move, let me know how I can help more with this December newslette=
r.  It is on my list for the weekend to recreate Lori Ewalt's article as a w=
ord attachment and get that to you.   I am glad that you have the permission=
 slip in hand.  --Sally=20

Sally - Yes, I have the permission slip for December's newsletter.  Wow!  Is=
 it really time to think about next month's?  We are closing on our house 11=
/26 (this all happened very quickly - a house in our neighborhood went on th=
e market and we looked at it and bought it, listed ours & have a contract on=
 it, too - in all of 3 weeks!) so things are nuts around here!!  I will be v=
ery disciplined and try to have the December newsletter ready so it can go t=
o Sally Walker before Thanksgiving.  We didn't plan this closing date very w=
ell, did we?!  Thanks for the kind words, and your speedy transmission of ar=
ticles!  Robin
