The intent is not to include 16b officers.  Payments will not be made if ter=
mination occurs prior to payment date.  I'll get back with you on the other =
issues.  Michelle

Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement parti=
cularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of=
 payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arra=
ngement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for "service=
 period/vesting" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be=
 careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are =
not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting=
/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a q=
uestion - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankrup=
tcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could =
set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will=
 run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion. =20

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doe=
sn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an i=
ssue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?
