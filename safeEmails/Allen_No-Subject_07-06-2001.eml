Tim,

I know you looked into this before but we are still having issues with Mike =
Grigsby's access to the west power site.  He can view some parts of the webs=
ite but cannot view the heatrate information under the testing tab.  Does he=
 have some sort of reduced access?  Our IT (Collin)  looked at Mike's access=
 but claimed that it must be on the Portland end.  Sorry to bother you with =
this again, but can you help?

Phillip
