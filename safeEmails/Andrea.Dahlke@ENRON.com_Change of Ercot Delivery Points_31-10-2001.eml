I am in the process of restructuring the Ercot Region in Enpower to align wi=
th the current Ercot zones (as well as the zones that will come into play in=
 2002).  I have made a few initial changes today that will impact the delive=
ry points you choose as you book deals in the North and South....

Old Delivery Point		New Delivery Point
North 2001			Ercot North
South 2001			Ercot South

I will be making additional changes later this week and will let you know wh=
at impact it has on you.  Let me know if you have any questions...

Thanks!

Andrea
