That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P.,  I would=20
like to use the short ones.





Hey what do you think of this one, I even thought we  could give what ever
ones you won't use for the church's programs on Sunday.

> HOW DO YOU LIVE YOUR DASH?

>   I read of a man who stood to speak

>  He referred to the dates on her tombstone

>  He noted that first came her date of birth
>  And spoke the following date with tears,

>  For that dash represents all the time
>  That she spent alive on earth...
>  And now only those who loved her
>  Know what that little line is worth.
>  For it matters not, how much we own;
>  The cars...the house...the cash,
>  What matters is how we live and love
>  And how we spend our dash.
>
>  So think about this long and hard...
>  Are there things you'd like to change?
>  For you never know how much time is left,
>  That can still be rearranged.
>  If we could just slow down enough
>  To consider what's true and real,

>  And be less quick to anger,
>  And show appreciation more
>  And love the people in our lives
>  Like we've never loved before.
>  If we treat each other with respect,
>  And more often wear a smile...
>  Remembering that this special dash
>  Might only last a little while.

>  So, when your eulogy's being read
>  With your life's actions to rehash...
>  Would you be proud of the things they say
>  About how you spent your dash?

> Makes a lot of Sense.
