Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have liste=
d
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 =3D 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 =3D 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume=
=20
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.
