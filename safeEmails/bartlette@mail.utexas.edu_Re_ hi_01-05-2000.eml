Hey Baby,

Today's been soooo crazy.  I haven't had time to get anything done today.

There not much else I can tell you about the project.  If it would help, I
could find out how far offshore the platform is.  El Paso has 2 pipeline
networks offshore Louisiana.  He can pick either one.  It really doesn't
matter to us.  We just want an estimate.

Did you email my mom yet?  I hope so!

Also, I won't be home until kind of late tonight.  My design group has a
meeting at 7 pm.  I probably won't be home until after 9.  I'll try to call
you between 5:30 and 7, okay?  If not, email me.

Love you,
Jenn
