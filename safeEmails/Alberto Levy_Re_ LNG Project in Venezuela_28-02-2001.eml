Certainly, Lisa. I've been working very closely with Emilio Vicens and Guido=
=20
Caranti, the leaders of the project. Please let me know what specific=20
questions do you have and perhaps I could help you better. As a general=20
overview, though, these are the highlights:
This is a joint project between PDVSA, the State-owned petroleum company, an=
d=20
Enron. So far, no other investors are on board. It is part of the commercial=
=20
strategy, however, that as soon as the project starts, there will be a=20
selldown.
As of yet, no agreement has been signed but final drafts or near final=20
documents have been negotiated:
Methane gas supply to the plant and natural gas liquids back to PDVSA (i.e.,=
=20
Gas Supply Agreement) is final, ready to sign. This document includes, among=
=20
other terms and conditions, the pricing structure with all the escalators,=20
delivery terms, the quality of gas, penalties for non-delivery, and service=20
fee for processing and returning the gas liquids.
Rights to plant site at Jose and rights to use existing pier (i.e., LNG Site=
s=20
and Pier Agreement, Usufruct and Servitude Agreement), both final and ready=20
to sign
PDVSA participation in the project, involving equity option, commercial=20
oversight and offtake term sheets (i.e., Participation Agreement) is near=20
final. PDVSA has an option of up to 25% ownership, in 5% steps, including=20
cero percent. PDVSA has to exercise this option within 180 days (or so,=20
please do not quote me on this date) from date of agreement
These documents, as well as clearance from the Ministry of the Environment=20
(for environmental requirements) and the Ministry of Infrastructure (for=20
utilization of port facilities), are ready to be approved but on hold until=20
the project is approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM).
MEM is delayed because it is performing a national energy balance, i.e.,=20
supply and demand of natural gas for the short, medium and long term (as in=20
any good centralized economy. Any resemblance to Eastern Europe ghosts is=20
pure coincidence). The argument goes that there's a short-term gas deficit=20
(these are the kind of things that happen when you don't let the market=20
work!) Every person we talk, though, has a different story, and the numbers=20
vary greatly. The latest version is that, with the accomplishment of a few=20
projects by PDVSA, the deficit would disappear in two-three years (the=20
project would require from three and a half to four years from signing date.=
)=20
There is no official position on this issue, however, and the numbers are=20
extremely hard to get. Meanwhile, there are huge distortions in the pricing=20
mechanisms (both by type of customer as well as by geographical location.)=20
Please note that Venezuela has reserves of 146 TCF, making it the seventh=20
largest country in the world in terms of reserves. Moreover, there has not=20
been exploration for gas, and therefore it is expected that the amount of=20
reserves would increase. Clearly, the reserve base is there.
Some efforts are being made to partially remove these distortions such as=20
escalate the price to more realistic levels and remove cross-subsidies among=
=20
customer classes and industries. A gas tariff is pending for approval by the=
=20
president. It should be out in the next few days. This resolution will tell =
a=20
lot about the development of gas projects in Venezuela, especially upstream,=
=20
because it sets the prices of gas independently of its origin (associated to=
=20
oil production vs. non-associated gas). It would also set a fixed floor at=20
which PDVSA would buy all the gas not marketed.
PDVSA has not been very effective in pushing the project in the MEM. We've=20
been shocked on how uninformed the MEM is. Given the traditional impositions=
=20
that PDVSA exerted on the MEM, the latter is weary of PDVSA's actions and=20
consequently is acting with lots of precaution. Our participation (we're=20
doing PDVSA's legwork) has provided significant momentum, such as the=20
creation of working groups to study its details. In any event, high ranking=20
officials told us that they are very interested and that we should get an=20
answer soon.
The meeting between Venezuela's Vice-President (Chavez himself, regretfully,=
=20
couldn't assist), the head of PDVSA Mr. Lameda, Mark Frevert, Mike McConnell=
,=20
and the head of the project Emilio Vicens went very well. Mr. Lameda at one=20
point said that this project represents a win-win-win situation for PDVSA,=20
the MEM, and Enron.
If you need any further assistance, please just let me know. Thanks,
ALF
