Talked with Metropolitan Utility District and NGTS today regarding Scheduled=
 Quantities by Location & Path Report.  Both are upset that format has chang=
ed and no longer MTD scheduled volumes showing.  They both sent me copies of=
 former reports and showed me what they liked about them.  Talked to John Bu=
chanan regarding this and he informed me to have them call our help desk to =
log situation.

Regards,

Nancy
