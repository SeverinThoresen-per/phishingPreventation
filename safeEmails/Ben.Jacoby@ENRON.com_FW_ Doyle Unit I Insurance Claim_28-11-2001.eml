Ron,

Please be advised that the settlement numbers you have outlined below are
acceptable to us , and the remaining net amount of $1,375,000 will be
processed for payment. We do not normally make payment by wire transfer, but
as I indicated to Jim Bouillion earlier today I am making inquiries to
determine if it can be done on this loss. I may have an answer for you this
afternoon.

Thank you and Jim for your assistance in resolving this matter

Regards / Russ Whitt
