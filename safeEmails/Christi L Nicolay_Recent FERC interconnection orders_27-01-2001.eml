FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent order=
s:

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous=20
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP)=20
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in=
=20
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically=
=20
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of=20
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order=
=20
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load=20
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a=20
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary t=
o=20
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator=20
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all=20
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and=20
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to=20
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may=20
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in=20
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. =20
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. =20
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some=20
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing=20
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides=
=20
that "Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as lon=
g=20
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by=20
Transmission Provider up to that point."  FPL's unfiled procedures allow=20
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers=20
includes similar procedures. =20

What are "material changes" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's=20
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2)=20
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and th=
e=20
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions=20
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service mor=
e=20
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3)=20
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the=
=20
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however,=20
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply ca=
n=20
result in loss of queue spot. =20

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&=
L=20
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.
