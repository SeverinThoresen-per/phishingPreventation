Gary - for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself=
 and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NN=
G north or south end.    We will log the ticket as a "Hot Seat" entry.   He =
will need to give us a little description - meter number and the tech's name=
 and location for the log entry purposes.  You can see that Mike wants to do=
cument and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to =
be aware of the problems that could affect the customer's measurement and af=
fect UAF & PPAs.   As we originally discussed,  this can only be done if all=
 EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk.

By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution wh=
en the volumes are correct in GMS.  George does all the database work and mo=
st of the notification of measurement problems.   We don't want to duplicate=
 efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in=
 the log that will be sent to NNG & Market Services Management,  Measurement=
 Specialist,  Measurement Operations, NNG Marketing,  Gas Control IT  &  NNG=
 Field Operations.=20

George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily r=
outine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on pote=
ntial measurement issues on any NNG station, north or south.    If we need t=
o follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech.   I=
t would be good if George would give us updates on physical/software repairs=
=2E   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could=
 make his own NNG entries & updates early in the morning before Jodie arrive=
s at 7 AM..   That is up to him.  He can actually get in the log anytime he =
wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries.   I was told that Geor=
ge would be retiring the end of the year.  Once George retires then we will =
start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection iss=
ues.  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort wor=
k.

Tks - Mike W.

Mike,   our objective is to send the log out weekly.   Right now most of the=
 activity in the log is being generated Enron internally by our proactive ap=
proach,  NNG Gas Control, NNG IT, Schedulers and Marketing folks.   Rick Die=
tz will be sending out an internal communication announcing the official for=
mation of the NNG Measurement Desk within Gas Logistics later on this week. =
   An external message will follow.   Once the external customers are made f=
ormally aware of the desk and the number is published we will pick up a lot =
more activity on potential measurement issues.   I would like to send out th=
e log weekly to Shelley, yourself, Rick Dietz, the Directors, Measurement Sp=
ecialist, Field Operation Teams, GMS, NNG Gas Control IT,  and anyone else t=
hat should be in the loop.   I will be sending the log out for the first tim=
e this week.

We also believe that we will have much more problem identification with a ne=
twork trouble tracking system is in place that is web based and interactive.=
    Once we have a better trouble tracking tool than our current Excel sprea=
dsheet log we will be able to be much more proactive with the help we will r=
eceive from the IT "Hot Seat" and GMS.    The "Hot Seat",  within Gas Contro=
l,  will soon be a 24 hour function so they will be monitoring many of the E=
FM scanning functions & telemetry and in a position to give us a "heads up" =
of potential measurement issues that we will troubleshoot and track to resol=
ution.  GMS will also be able to access the log and make entries that they b=
elieve are significant measurement issues.=20

Mike, you can count on our continued commitment to work with your field oper=
ations personnel, Gas Control IT, Field Measurement Services, and GMS to min=
imize measurement issues and reduce UAF.

Tks - Mike W. NNG Measurement Desk (713)853-7742
