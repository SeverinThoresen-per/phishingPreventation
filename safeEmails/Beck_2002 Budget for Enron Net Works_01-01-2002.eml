ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting =
in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent =
upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our bu=
dget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revise=
d 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and as=
sociated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that pr=
ocess been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for EN=
W? =20

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we c=
an complete this budget process. =20

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally=20
