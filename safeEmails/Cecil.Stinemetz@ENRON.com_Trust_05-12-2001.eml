Mr. Lay

We have had personal correspondence over the last 12 years or so and I have =
admired you for taking the time to write back to me even though I was just a=
n employee and you were CEO. =20

Even after all this stuff that is going on, I still believe that you are hon=
est and trustworthy.  I don't understand all that has gone on and probably n=
ever will, I just know that after 17 years and being "stupid", I had all my =
retirement in Enron.  I am probably dumb again, but I just used some of my o=
wn money to buy Enron stock. I feel that the way to bring the stock back up =
is to invest and work harder. My father who has Enron stock that came from m=
y deceased grandfather who retired as a NNG superintendent, has also just bo=
ught more stock.  We are trying and I know you are too. =20

I know that you are going through a lot and I am praying for you and your fa=
mily.=20
Cecil Stinemetz
