I received a call from UtiliCorp's counsel yesterday and he was asking=20
questions about how we would structure an option with respect to power.  He=20
was describing an financial  option that could be settled physically and was=
=20
wondering who the counterparty on our side would be.  Would or can we do suc=
h=20
an option and if so, would ENA or EPMI be the counterparty?
Carol
