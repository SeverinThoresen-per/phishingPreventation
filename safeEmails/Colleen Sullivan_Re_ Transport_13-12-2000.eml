I think you're doing the right thing by first getting with Zimin to make sur=
e=20
he agrees and will sign off on this change.  Next, before we just change thi=
s=20
in the model, I will want Greg to run "parallel" valuations to see what the=20
impact will be on each person's book.  Then, we will get with the traders an=
d=20
see how they want to implement it.  Since the book runners are using the=20
correlation to basically make the books have what they believe is a market=20
value for capacity, I would assume that they may want to change correlation=20
to offset the value change in the volatility; however, that decision will be=
=20
left to each book runner. =20

Let me know what you hear back from Zimin.

Hey Colleen, how are thing going?  I haven't talked to you in a while.=20

I was trying to tie out a transportation deal in the books with my transport=
=20
model.  I found that the transportation spreadsheet that the books are being=
=20
closed out with was valuing extrinsic value over what my model valued it.  I=
=20
reconciled the differences and the main difference was due to the blending o=
f=20
the volatilities.  I brought this problem up back in October of this year. =20
Do you remember?   When I talked to Greg Couch today, those changes were not=
=20
made.  I think that it is an issue with all the transportation deals.  =20

The problem is related to the number of days that is used to weight the=20
daily/omicron volatility.  Basically, transportation is a daily spread optio=
n=20
and if you look at a month like November for instance, you have 30 different=
=20
daily options.  If you were to look at the number of days that the=20
daily/omicron volatility should be used you would have the first option with=
=20
1 day of daily vol, the second with 2 days of daily vol, the third with 3=20
days of daily vol and so on and so on.  The average number of days that=20
should be used to weight the daily/omicron volatility is 15 or the number of=
=20
days in each particular month divided by 2.  The transportation spreadsheet=20
is weighting that volatility with the total number of days in the month. =20
This usually overstates the extrinsic value since that the daily/omicron=20
volatility is usually higher than the monthly volatility. =20

Please let me know what you would like me to do.  I have a call into Zimin t=
o=20
make sure that my logic is correct.  Thanks.=20
