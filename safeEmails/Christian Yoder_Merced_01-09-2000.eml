Sara,
Under the influence of a heightened sensitivity to the issue of Muni=20
authorization, we need to know whether or not our ISDA with Merced has any=20
restrictions on length of transactions which we should be aware of.  Stewart=
=20
wants to do an 18 month swap soon.  Mark T. looked it up on the data base fo=
r=20
me and apparently the Board of Merced passed a resolution approving the ISDA=
=20
and "certain transactions" thereunder.  We need to know what kinds of=20
transcations they can and cannot do.  Thanks very much.---cgy
