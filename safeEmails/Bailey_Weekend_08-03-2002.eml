Dona,

It has just dawned on me that I never got back to confirm which day this wee=
kend we should rendevous.   I know that David will be out of town hunting an=
d that you had proposed Friday -- drinks or Sat./Sun.

If you have not made plans for Friday, I thought that would be fun to have a=
 little happy hour--that would give me reason to leave early on Friday.

If thats not good, then Sat. or Sun . will work.

Look forward to your response.


Cordially,=20
