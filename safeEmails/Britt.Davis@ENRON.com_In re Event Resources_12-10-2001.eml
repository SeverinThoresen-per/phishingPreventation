	Dorie and Michelle,

	This will update you on the latest developments.  Bob and I are working on =
finding a solution that resolves all the issues, which get complex, due to t=
he fact that not only has the Hilton made claims against Enron, but also aga=
inst Event Resources in the bankruptcy proceeding.  In other words, even if =
we succeed in facing down the Hilton on its claims directly against us, the =
Hilton may be able to recover some percentage of those claims directly from =
Event Resources in the bankruptcy proceeding, reducing the overall amount ot=
her creditors, such as Enron, can recover from Event Resources.  You will re=
call that Enron is trying to recover $225,000 that it advanced to Event Reso=
urces for the 2000 ENA Holiday Party.

	Bob will be speaking with Cindy Olson, his client, about what she would be =
willing to do in the way of future events. =20

	Once he hears back,  we will speak with you about the best way of resolving=
 the Hilton's claim against us for the Torrey Pines/La Jolla event, which th=
e Hilton's attorney appears more interested in than the Hilton's claim again=
st Enron for the San Antonio/Palacio Del Rio event.  This is reportedly beca=
use the Hilton was actually provided the services for the Torrey Pines/La Jo=
lla event.  As you know, we actually paid Event Resources for that event, an=
d think we have a good position regarding not having to pay anything further=
=2E  Again, however, we need to keep in mind (a) if the Hilton sues us direc=
tly, we will incur attorneys' fees even in successfully defending the claim =
(perhaps we could file a dec. action to offset that risk) and (b) the Hilton=
 clearly has a great claim against Event Resources for the Torrey Pines/La J=
olla event, putting at risk some portion of the $225,000 we are seeking to r=
ecover.

	Also, please be advised that George Neeson, a Hilton v-p in charge of build=
ing infrastructure contracts, has recently contacted Ron Menton of EES, whic=
h has several such contracts with the Hilton, asking that Menton ensure that=
 this matter be given the proper attention so that it can be resolved.  I ha=
ve already spoken to Ron about this and will also speak with his EES attorne=
y, Sarah Dietrich.  According to Menton, Neeson is not indicating that our l=
egal issues are imperilling any present or future deals, and Menton (in resp=
onse to my specific question) is not taking the position that we have to res=
olve these issues other than based on our own straight-up legal analysis.

	 I will keep you advised.

	Britt
