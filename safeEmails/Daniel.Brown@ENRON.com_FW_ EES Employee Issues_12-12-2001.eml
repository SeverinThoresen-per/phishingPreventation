Dan/Dave,

We are working to gather as much information as possible on our exposure to =
relocated former and current domestic and international employees impacted b=
y Enron's bankruptcy filing.  Lloyd has outlined our position on the urgent =
issues below. Please keep in mind that regardless of our obligation, the cou=
rts have only approved $15K per employee for all expenses less the $4500 pay=
ment if applicable.

We will continue to work on getting a comprehensive listing over the next co=
uple of days.

Daniel

Daniel,

Per our conversation earlier, I am responding to some of your more urgent em=
ployee situations:

Faye Worthy -

Faye was one of the individuals who received a letter from All Relo-Services=
, Inc/Road Runner Moving & Storage regarding non payment of her moving bill.=
  A number of suppliers hand delivered invoices to Enron on Friday, November=
 30th.  When information was released on Sunday regarding Enron's filing for=
 bankruptcy, many of the suppliers got extremely nervous. Faye Worthy's movi=
ng bill was for $9,293.69.  On Friday, December 7th., the moving company sen=
t out demand letters to about 33 current and former Enron employees demandin=
g immediate payment since Enron had not yet paid the moving bills.  We were =
advised that no payments could be made at this time.

Outstanding issues for Faye Worthy:

Unpaid household goods bill -	$9,293.69
Unpaid Temporary Living 	$8,400.00  ($4,500 per month - November & December =
unpaid)

It is my understanding that Faye Worthy was going to make the temporary livi=
ng payments and Judy Gray was going to reimburse her.  The household goods b=
ill remains unpaid.  We are awaiting instructions on how and when the outsta=
nding invoices can be paid.


Stephen Borden

Outstanding issues:

Household goods were not delivered on 12/03/01 as scheduled.  The moving com=
pany (Xonex) decided not to release his shipment due to Enron's bankruptcy f=
iling.  The amount of the household goods bill is $12,057.38.

New Home Closing Costs - Mr. Borden was scheduled to be reimbursed for his n=
ew home closing costs of $22,600.  Mr. Borden purchased his new home and clo=
sed on 11/30/01. He paid all of the closing costs.  When the relocation depa=
rtment received his reimbursement documentation, it was to late to process d=
ue to the bankruptcy filing.

Per George Wasaff and Judy Gray, they were scheduled to pay Mr. Borden $15,0=
00 maximum including $4,500 severance for all relocation and business expens=
es.  Mr. Borden has $10,000 in business travel expenses that has not been re=
imbursed.

Recap:

Household Goods - not paid		$12,057.38
New Home Closing Costs 		$22,600.00 (Paid by Borden and not yet reimbursed)
Business Travel Expenses - 		$10,000 (Paid by Borden and not yet reimbursed)
Final Move Expenses - not paid		$235.00=20


Stuart Rexrode -

Outstanding issues:

Mr. Rexrode has been contacted by Prudential household goods moving company.=
  At this point, his shipment has not yet taken place.

Kevin Greiner -

Air shipment has been received.  His ocean shipment is currently in storage =
with Transportation Worldwide, Inc., (Houston, TX) pending receipt of paymen=
t. =20

Steven Peterson -

Since December 06, 01, shipment has been  held in storage by Transportation =
Worldwide, Inc. (Houston, TX).

Tim/Lloyd,

As you can see from the emails below, EES leadership is extremely concerned =
about our exposure to both domestic and international relocations. I need to=
 obtain the information on our folks by 11:00 a.m. today so that I can prepa=
re and deliver a document to them.

Please let me know if this will be a problem.

Thanks,
Daniel

Guys, can you please provide an update/status and plan to manage the followi=
ng EES employee issues:

	a) Steve Borden - moving issues on sale of house and furniture;
	b) Faye Worthy - moving issues on furniture and apartment;
	c) Stuart Rexrode - moving issues on furniture, etc;
	d) Kevin Greiner - moving issues, etc;
	e) Steven Peterson - moving issues, etc;

Great job on Maureen.  Kalen are you aware of any other EES employee issues =
(such as what we spoke about on Friday) where I can help.  I believe Dan is =
looking at this as well.

Do we think it might be a good idea to have a meeting to discuss globally?

Regards
Delainey
