Things have gone well this week.  I was able to et most of the=20
personnel/administrative stuff out of the way.  (Thanx Keegan!).     Also, I=
=20
located lots of background reading on everything I ever wanted to know about=
=20
the swaps market and how we fit in.  With Tana"s help, I also watched the=20
"deal tape" which I found both amusing and informative.
=20
I will be out of the office for most of this afternoon.   My recruiter is=20
available this afternoon to take me around to secure a permanent apartment=20
closer to work -- in the Montrose or River Oaks area.   I  quickly decided=20
that commuting from the burbs is not for me.  (You can take me out of=20
Manhattan but can't take the Manhattan out of me).   =20
