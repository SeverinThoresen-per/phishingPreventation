Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been=20
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since=20
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter=20
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom=20
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We onl=
y=20
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2. =20

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Aimee,
Please check meter #1591 Lamay gas lift.  It doesn't appear to have very muc=
h=20
flow and the
BAV is showing the nom volume.  This could be adversely affecting the risk=20
numbers.  Pat
