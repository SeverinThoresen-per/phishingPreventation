Ok...I thought the addition of "life partners" to the table simply intensifi=
ed the revelry normally associated with "Man Night"...                 it wa=
s like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the =
"other side" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini=
-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, a=
lmost to the point of boredom. Thank God "They" arrived b/c they brought out=
 the best in the "Men".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing t=
he Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit th=
e least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, f=
ish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. =
Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why =
Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is=
 nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equiva=
lent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the nat=
ives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and =
tasty. Enjoyed the "Diablo" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guaca=
mole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. Th=
e shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started=
 in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then fini=
shed over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have b=
een left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-gr=
ill.

Ritas- "Rocas" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always=
=2E Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

OUT

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,=20
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how=20
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat,=20
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN=20
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn=
=20
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for=20
being most "in" to the effort.
