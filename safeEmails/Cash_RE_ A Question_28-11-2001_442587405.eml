Go ahead and pose the question, but the answer should be that we don't comme=
nt at all on litigation, and that the terms of severance plan and related wa=
ivers will govern the situation.  We should reiterate that we can't provide =
with legal advice.  Michelle

My recommendation would be that we don't comment at all, but let the terms o=
f the Plan and the related waivers speak for themselves.  We cannot provide =
them with legal advice.  Michelle

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to sev=
erance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible =
for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that pl=
an will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this tim=
e.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release =
of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, e=
mployees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the mer=
ged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements. =20

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, b=
ut don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany=
 scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will tha=
t affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver a=
s part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareho=
lder class action suite against Enron.
