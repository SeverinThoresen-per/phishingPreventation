Hey ,
I checked on the tickets and she is sending them to me and I will send them=20
to you.  She mention that they are for the 15th, which is a Friday, I guess =
a=20
night game but I'm not sure.  I recall your most recent e-mail as stating th=
e=20
16th - is that right.  If so, I hope their wasn't a screwup on anyone's=20
part.  Please let me know.  Thanks
Ben
