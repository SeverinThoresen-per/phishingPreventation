Kerry,

As you are probably aware, the EES Risk Control organization is moving under=
 Sally as of April 30, 2001.  Our initial thought was we would keep all the =
former EES employees together in a new ENA accounting entity, but have now d=
ecided that the Risk Control group needs to be captured as part of Enron Net=
Works.  These were previously set up under a new ENA company number (#1596).=
  I don't know if within SAP we can simply repoint the profit and cost cente=
rs set up below to roll-up under ENW now instead of ENA, if not, we will nee=
d five new ones set up as follows:

	Executive (Meredith Eggleston)-27101 [Simper, Keith]  ,150260
	Risk Analytics (Neil Hong)-27102 [Simper, Keith]  ,150261=20
	Strategic Operations, Process & Systems (Scott Mills)-27103 [Simper, Keith]=
  150262=20
	Deal Capture/Confirmation (Meredith Eggleston)-27104 [Simper, Keith]  ,1502=
63=20
	Global Data Management (Mark Evans)27105 [Simper, Keith]  ,150264=20

Thanks and don't hesitate to call with questions.

Thanks

Wade
