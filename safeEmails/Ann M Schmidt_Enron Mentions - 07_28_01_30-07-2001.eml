INDIA: Enron says wants Indian govt to buy its Dabhol stake.

BOMBAY, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron Corp said on Saturday it=
=20
wants to sell its stake in the Dabhol Power Company either to the Indian=20
federal government or to the project's lenders.=20
"As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling its interes=
t=20
either to the government of India or to the project's lenders is the best=20
approach to resolve the protracted dispute," a spokesman for its Indian unit=
=20
told Reuters.
This follows comments made by Enron chairman Kenneth Lay in Friday's issue o=
f=20
Financial Times that Enron is looking to exit from its Indian venture.=20
The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), 65 percent owned by the Enron Corp, is=20

"We want out," said Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay in an interview with the=20

to supply power to a state-owned utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity=20
Board (MSEB), from its gas-based plant on the state's west coast.=20
But MSEB stopped buying power in May calling it expensive and defaulted on=20
payments jeopardising the project's future.=20
"We have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a=20
point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners=20
do," Lay said in the Financial Times interview.=20
Besides Enron, the other shareholders in DPC are U.S. group General Electric=

and Bechtel which own 10 percent each and MSEB with 15 percent.=20
Earlier this month Lay had a meeting with India's Finance Minister Yashwant=20

Arundhati Roy burst on to the Indian national stage from nowhere in 1997. A=20
drop-out architecture student and one-time aerobics instructor, she had=20
turned her hand to writing a novel. It was The God Of Small Things, and it=20
earned her one of India's biggest ever advances before going on to win the=20
Booker Prize and sell six million copies. The rebellious outsider - southern=
=20
and female - had trumped the coterie of men who dominate India's literary=20
world, and the reward was an insatiable international fascination. She found=
=20
herself cast in the role of Indian national mascot, adored and feted for her=
=20
global success.=20
Four years later, there have been no more novels, and the now 39-year-old=20
darling of India's middle class has become a painful thorn in its side,=20
writing a series of savage critiques of India's development - its nuclear=20
tests, its huge dam-construction projects and its cringing obeisance to=20
western corporate power. These are home truths that powerful interests in=20
India do not want to hear, and Roy has made herself many enemies. Irritated=20
by her criticisms and the publicity they invariably attract in the west, the=
=20
Indian establishment has set about trying to cut this awkward rebel down to=20
size. This week, Roy faces a contempt of court charge before the Indian=20
Supreme Court - her first appearance in the drawn-out case was four months=20
ago. Her alleged crime is to have attended a demonstration against the=20
court's decision last autumn to give the go-ahead to the country's most=20
controversial dam project, the Sardar Sarovar in the Narmada valley, central=
=20
India. Roy is accused of inciting violence and attacking a court official.=20
Ludicrous though many aspects of the case appear to be, the lawyers Roy=20
consulted advised her to plead guilty and apologise. When she refused, none=20
would risk his career to represent her. Undeterred, she wrote her own=20
affidavit and defiantly had it published in a mass-circulation magazine on=20
the day of her first court appearance, much to the fury of the court, which=20
has threatened further proceedings. Roy risks a six-month jail sentence.
How did the writer of an intensely lyrical novel become a committed activist=
=20
with an analytical prose worthy of a barrister? What induced her to swap her=
=20
status as Delhi's most-favoured dinner party guest for night marches and=20
sit-ins at the dam sites, and even, possibly, jail? Why did the whimsical=20
chronicler of "small things" - the beetles and creeping, lush greenery of=20
Kerala - turn to fighting big things such as nuclear bombs, dams, the Indian=
=20
state and globalisation?=20
Roy comes down four flights of stairs to open the door to her apartment=20
block. Here, where she writes and spends most of her day, she has none of th=
e=20
small army of servants considered necessary by middle-class Delhi. Her flat=20
is surrounded by the contradictions of Indian development, which she analyse=
s=20
in her essays: a comfortable suburb of New Delhi, where cows rummage in the=20
rubbish piled up in the open gutters, and where a man has set up shop in the=
=20
shade of a tree, ironing the neighbourhood's washing, probably earning in a=20
day just enough to buy one cafe latte in the new, empty, air- conditioned=20
coffee shop.=20
We sit in a crepuscular gloom, the fierce Delhi summer requiring that all th=
e=20
blinds be drawn, and the air-conditioning is on in Roy's small apartment of=20
strong primary colours, books, a big television and computer. She talks in a=
=20
low, gentle voice. It's a sharp contrast to the vehemence and coruscating wi=
t=20
of her writing. "I like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things, not=20
into small, petty things with people around me," she says. "I am surrounded=20
by people I love, and what I crave is gentleness." Friends come and go, and=20
the telephone rings frequently.=20
We get off to a bad start, because Roy hates the "writer-activist" label wit=
h=20
which she is saddled - it reminds her of "sofa-bed". She writes what she=20
sees, she says, and she sees no great distinction between fiction and=20
non-fiction; all she does is keep her "aching eyes open". She refers me to a=
n=20
address on writing that she gave earlier this year in the US: "In the midst=20
of putative peace, a writer can, like I did, be unfortunate enough to stumbl=
e=20
on a silent war. The trouble is that once you see it, you can't unsee it. An=
d=20
once you've seen it, keeping quiet, saying nothing, becomes as political an=20
act as speaking out."=20
She stumbled on a silent war in 1998, after a giddy year of international=20
celebrity which, she admits, she enjoyed "immensely" (all those hotel towels=
,=20
she enthuses in one essay), but she knew, in the end, that the "good manners=
=20
and hygiene" would kill her. What anchored her as she spun around the globe=20
was home, and she resisted the temptations of emigration. "I'm not the sort=20
of person who can buy a life." She came to see fame much like a tin can=20
trailing noisily behind her wherever she went: eventually, it would drop off=
=20
and she would then write some "worstsellers" and eat mangoes in the=20
moonlight.=20
But the prospect of such leisure vanished as she returned home to look at he=
r=20
country with new eyes: India was jubilant at its first nuclear test, and Roy=
=20
penned The End Of Imagination, a furious attack on this symbol of national=20
pride. The title was misplaced, however, because what then captured her=20
imagination, and has done ever since, was that the biggest mass non-violent=20
movement since Indian independence - the campaign against the Narmada valley=
=20
dams - was then on the brink of victory. She set aside the novels she had=20
been planning to read and threw herself into the detail of technical subject=
s=20
such as irrigation and drainage. Since then, her voracious curiosity has=20
ranged from export credit guarantees to electricity distribution rates and=20
resettlement programmes for those displaced by the dams.=20
Roy has spent much time reflecting on the direction her life has taken. She=20
describes, with a romanticism akin to Tolstoy's, how the marches she attends=
=20
in the Narmada valley have given her a pride in her people and her land, and=
=20
also a philosophy. The struggle has rooted her, intellectually and=20
emotionally, after the upheaval of celebrity. It also helped assuage the=20
guilt over her sudden wealth, which she once described as making her feel sh=
e=20
had "perforated the huge pipeline that circulates the world's wealth . . .=20
and it is spewing money at me, bruising me with its speed and strength. I=20
began to feel as though every emotion, every little strand of feeling in The=
=20
God Of Small Things, had been traded in for a silver coin." Her interest in=20
the dam is less personal, she says. Like any writer, she wants to understand=
=20
and tell stories, and dams sum up, like nothing else, the story of modern=20
India: its greed, its wanton violence and its centralisation of power.=20
Surprisingly, in all these reflections, Roy steadfastly omits any reference=20
to the deep emotional attachment to the rivers of her Kerala childhood, whic=
h=20
is so evident in the novel. In one vivid passage, she describes the=20
humiliation of the river after a saltwater barrage has been built: "A thin=20
ribbon of thick water that lapped wearily at the mud banks on either side,=20
sequinned with the occasional silver slant of a dead fish. It was choked wit=
h=20
a succulent weed, whose furred brown roots waved like thin tentacles under=20
water . . . Once it had had the power to evoke fear. To change lives. But no=
w=20
its teeth were drawn, its spirit spent. It was just a slow, sludging green=20
ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea." Almost every page of The=
=20
God Of Small Things reverberates with the fragile vulnerability of the small=
=20
- children, for starters, and an intense awareness of millions of tiny livin=
g=20
things, and the preciousness of small quotidian events. This reflects a=20
fierce protectiveness towards the small and the powerless that predates her=20
literary fame; her student thesis, she says, was on the housing of the=20
marginalised urban poor. Bombs and dams are the corollary of India's slums:=20
the bombs have diverted the taxes, and the dams have deprived millions of=20
their lands and their rivers.=20
Despite the legal cases, and the veiled threats and savage attacks in the=20
media, even by erstwhile allies, Roy is standing her ground. Her political=20
writings have evolved from passionate polemic into something more dangerous:=
=20
a considered and witty analysis of globalisation and its impact on India. Sh=
e=20
asks questions that are particularly awkward for the nationalist middle=20
classes who are prospering on neoliberalism. Is globalisation "a process of=20
barbaric dispossession which has few parallels in history? Is it a mutant=20
variety of colonialism, remote-controlled and digitally-operated?" Roy has a=
=20
wonderful sense of her own pace - she will not be hurried, or hurry herself =
-=20
but she is slowly putting together what she calls a "politics of opposition"=
=2E=20
She already senses her place on the intellectual map of anti-globalisation;=20
she's been reading Noam Chomsky, John Berger and tomes on the history of the=
=20
third world; she is keen to meet the Mexican Zapatista hero, Subcommandante=20
Marcos; and she wants to attend the next meeting of the World Trade=20
Organisation. But she is aware that this is not just a matter of acquiring=20
the right intellectual baggage. Her politics flow seamlessly from her public=
=20
life into her private; her analysis of power is not just applied to Indian=20
democracy, but also to how she relates to her family and friends, and how sh=
e=20
deals with her celebrity and wealth.=20
Roy's political essays, powerful though they are, have not so far achieved=20
their objectives. The End Of Imagination in 1998 won her many admirers in th=
e=20
west, but in India it failed to dent the extraordinary consensus behind the=20
nuclear bomb. The Greater Common Good in 1999, on India's preoccupation with=
=20
dam-building in the 50 years since independence, pointed out that the dams=20
had woefully failed to meet targets for either power generation or=20
irrigation, while at the same time displacing at least 33 million people. Ro=
y=20
argued that the bulk of those displaced were untouchables or tribal peoples,=
=20
and that this amounted to a form of genocide. The essay won her more admirer=
s=20
in the west and lent weight to the international campaigns against dams.=20
The worldwide publicity that Roy has attracted by campaigning against the=20
dams has succeeded in scaring off several western contractors of the huge=20
Narmada project - it involves building 3,200 dams, including 30 major ones.=20
But despite all her eloquence, and despite the mass protest movement, the=20
Supreme Court ruled last October that work on the huge Sardar Sarovar dam=20
could resume. It was a bitter setback to a movement that had believed it was=
=20
on the brink of victory after a series of stunning successes, including the=20
withdrawal from the project of the World Bank. The defeat means that now, as=
=20
Roy faces her court hearing in Delhi, hundreds of miles away in Narmada the=20
arrival of the monsoon season has set the waters rising again behind the dam=
=2E=20
Over the next few weeks, police will have to drag people from their homes to=
=20
prevent suicide protests by drowning: "While the judges are discussing our=20
contempt of court case, people will stand chest-deep in water for days.=20
Forget the Narmada, where hundreds of thousands of cases [of compensation fo=
r=20
lost land] are pending in the courts; a three-judge bench will spend days=20
discussing my case. But losing their dignity is much more important to the=20
judges."=20
The Sardar Sarovar dam alone will displace 400,000 people, and the state=20
worst affected, Madya Pradesh, has officially declared that it has no land o=
n=20
which to resettle the people whose whole way of life for thousands of years=20
has been bound up with the Narmada, one of the great rivers of India. What=20
has embittered the battle is that most of the thousands of poor farmers and=20
fishermen displaced in the past decade have yet to be resettled. In reality,=
=20
many of those who lose their lands or livelihoods are likely to receive=20
nothing more than paltry financial compensation. They end up either as cheap=
=20
agricultural labour or swell the shanty towns. Both options are close to=20
destitution. Meanwhile, promises that the dams will help irrigate dry region=
s=20
of Gujarat ring hollow, not least because none of the necessary canals has=20
been budgeted for. In reality, the dams will provide electricity and water=20
for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which is why th=
e=20
Supreme Court judgment was greeted with jubilation in Gujarat's cities.=20
The dam presents a stark conflict between the interests of urban and rural,=20
between industrial and subsistence economies; and it crystallises Roy's own=20
questions about progress - that the poorest are crushed in the pursuit of=20
development. "I can imagine in the 50s what a fantastic feat of engineering =
a=20
dam appeared to be, but now, when what we know about nature is little enough=
,=20
how can you continue to think this is a wonderful thing to do? To intervene=20
in such a massive way in such a complex process - it's like putting a=20
jackboot into a spider's web. What kind of civilisation is it when you teach=
=20
men in college to look at a river and imagine pouring concrete into it?" she=
=20
demands.=20
The one hope of forestalling the next big Narmada dam scheduled, the=20
Maheshwar, is that it will fail to find the necessary financing within India=
,=20
now that the project has become too controversial for any western contractor=
=2E=20
Emboldened by this success, in her two most recent essays Roy has broadened=20
the scope of her attacks to include the western corporations involved in the=
=20
privatisation of Indian state electricity companies, in particular the US=20
company Enron. Enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive=20
contract to build a power plant near Bombay with Dollars 20m to "educate"=20
politicians and bureaucrats; now the electricity Enron produces is more=20
expensive than any of its competitors', yet Maharastra state is locked into=20
contractual payments of Dollars 220m a year.=20
Such "business arrangements between these huge multinationals in the west an=
d=20
the third world elite", says Roy, promote a consensus that their model of=20
globalisation - liberalisation and privatisation - represents progress: "It'=
s=20
a form of fundamentalism to believe that this is the only measure of progres=
s=20
- how much electricity is consumed, how much more rice is produced, whether=20
it is eaten or goes to waste in warehouses. Even the tools the economists=20
have developed to measure progress are flawed," she says, adding, "I think o=
f=20
globalisation like a light which shines brighter and brighter on a few peopl=
e=20
and the rest are in darkness, wiped out. They simply can't be seen. The=20
lobotomy in the west is that you stop seeing something and then, slowly, it'=
s=20
not possible to see it. It never existed and there is no possibility of an=20
alternative."=20
But the alternative still exists in India, she believes - the country is too=
=20
old and clever to be lobotomised into believing in the one single idea, "tha=
t=20
life is profit".=20
Defying the tyranny of this idea is a constant thread running through Roy's=20
politics and her private life. It lies behind plans to set up with friends a=
n=20
Indian-based Corporate Watch to monitor corporate power. It informs how she=20
is mapping out a politics that demands accountability, whatever the regime.=20
"The only way to keep power on a tight leash is to oppose it, never to seek=20
to own it or have it," she says. "Opposition is permanent." But these big=20
political ideas also have deeply personal implications, she adds: "Personal=20
politics and what you do from day to day is just as important as=20
globalisation, and opposition to power has to be matched by a reluctance to=20
use power in your own relationships. You oppose by the way you live as much=20
as by what you say and do - and that is painful and joyful."=20
Joy features prominently in her description of the politics of opposition -=20
against all the odds, you defy your critics simply by having too much fun.=20
That's why they couldn't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up=20
in Kerala, she remembers - they simply weren't as unhappy as a single mother=
=20
and her "thin, black, clever" daughter should have been. "The whole point of=
=20
the feminist fight was that there has to be fun at the end of the tunnel. Yo=
u=20
don't want this image of beaten, oppressed, moaning women. You think about=20
things, engage with the world, and you're aware of the terrible suffering=20
that is happening around you, and the way to be with all of that is to enjoy=
=20
the process of what you are doing and to speak joy in the saddest places. If=
=20
you're living in a world that is telling you that only if you have=20
hamburgers, buy diamonds and have a Rolls-Royce can you be happy, then you'r=
e=20
saying in the happiest possible way that that is completely wrong." She adds=
,=20
"It's a game of survival, and if you allow yourself to become unhappy, you=20
will lose everything. I remember what my mother said to me: 'I've never know=
n=20
anyone who guards their happiness so fiercely.' I think it's important to=20
patrol the borders of your happiness, to understand your sources of joy and=20
to protect them, and to know that, so often, it's only when that happiness=20
has gone that you know what it was. But you can be cooking or listening to=20
music and think, I don't need anything else to happen or anyone else to be=20
any other way in order to be happy."=20
Happiness for her, she says, might be going to the market and choosing glass=
=20
beads after weeks of late nights drafting an affidavit, or just lying on the=
=20
floor all day with friends under a ceiling fan in the Delhi summer. Even=20
gossiping with friends about relationships as the police move in to break up=
=20
a demonstration at a dam site. These are what Roy describes as the "small=20
delights" of her life, a source of the strength that has seen her through th=
e=20
turbulence of her meteoric rise to global fame and, now, the anxiety of the=20
court cases. She describes her friends as "extraordinary people" for dealing=
=20
with her sudden fame and money, and managing to maintain the "democratic=20
nature of our friendships". None of them had money before, now she gives her=
s=20
away, "and I know that it is as sophisticated an act to receive as to give=20
it". She has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest=
=20
of her life; she eschewed more, refusing to sell the film rights, arguing=20
democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in=
=20
their heads and she didn't want a single film-maker to replace them all.=20
The fame has been burdensome, although she claims (somewhat implausibly,=20
since she had her hair cut, a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that=20
fetishises long hair) that she has some anonymity in India (when asked if sh=
e=20
is Arundhati Roy, she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were).=20
The causes in need of her celebrity are endless, and she turns down most of=20
the requests that come in from all over the world: would she open a lung=20
hospital in Kerala? Attend a conference on water in the Hague? Give a speech=
=20
on being a writer at Amherst? Model for Cartier? Make a BBC television=20
documentary? Roy smiles mischievously: "One woman phoned me and said, 'Oh,=20
darling, that essay on the Narmada was absolutely wonderful. I wonder if you=
=20
could do one for me on child abuse?' And I said, 'For or against?'"=20
The most important thing, she says, is to keep in mind your own=20
insignificance; she can't speak about every issue and do them all justice.=20
She adds thoughtfully, "Sometimes it's hard, because fate has conspired to=20
make my voice heard, so you have the illusion - or other people have - that=20
you can do a lot."=20
Roy is wary of the fickleness of fame, and likens it to a wind blowing=20
through a house and all the shutters banging: "There were moments when I was=
=20
so unhappy that I wished I hadn't written the book and I hadn't won the=20

resolved. She lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of=20

why so many women have children. She has none herself by her marriage to a=20
film-maker 10 years her senior, and has no plans to have any: "Until=20

MUMBAI, July 27. THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposal=
s=20
of six States to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials. The company was told=20
that there was combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 2.5=
0=20
per unit.=20
"One thing is abundantly clear. There is demand for (DPC) power at a=20
particular price. If the price increases the demand may not be large" Dr=20
Godbole told reporters.
" We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DPC power is not at=20
baseload, nor is it an all-year-round demand. The States will require this=20
power only between the months of April to November and the demand will fall=20
during the rainy season," he said.=20
Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the pane=
l=20
yesterday. Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking for=
=20
300 and 100 MW each.=20
While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1.65 per unit, other States=20
have said they will not pay more than Rs 2.25 to Rs 2.40 per unit.=20
According to Dr Godbole, the company officials will "take up the matter with=
=20
lenders and collaborators" before the next meeting which is expected to be=20
held in August. Meanwhile, according to DPC, the power purchase proposals=20
presented by various States "are totally unrealistic and unattainable by new=
=20
generation liquid fuel plants including even those in the public sector such=
=20
as NTPC's Kayamkulam".=20
Dr Godbole had suggested that DPC power "at competitive rates" could replace=

captive power in a number of States. He said though DPC had earlier agreed t=

"Our dialogue with Enron is bogged down by two issues- the plant load factor=

there was a need to take a "serious look at whether demand projections in th=

Wind power scrutinized as state considers energy plans

ALTA, Iowa (AP) - Rising out of a cornfield less than half a mile from Chuck=
=20
Goodman's back door are three huge, whirling wind turbines, pumping=20
electricity into the state's energy grid.=20
Goodman leases the property to Enron Wind Corp., a California-based energy=20
company, for its 292-foot-tall turbines. In all, the company has 247 sets of=
=20
black, swooping blades churning out 193 megawatts of electricity - enough=20
power for 72,000 homes. Twenty-one miles long, 7 1/2 miles wide, it is toute=
d=20
as the world's largest wind farm.
"It's something I believe in and I want to see it grow," Goodman, 73, says o=
f=20
wind power. "It's clean. It renews itself every day."=20
Wind power has become a buzz word among energy companies, planners and=20
environmentalists in Iowa as the state looks ahead to its energy needs.=20
State regulators expect Iowa to exceed its current energy supply within two=20
years. By 2003, Iowa's demand for electricity in the summer, when the need=20
for air conditioning peaks, will outstrip generating capacity by 191=20
megawatts, an Iowa Utilities Board report said.=20
Legislators, spooked by rolling blackouts in California last spring, reacted=
=20
with a bill that makes it easier to build new power plants in Iowa by=20
removing some regulatory hurdles.=20
Among the policymakers pressing for more consideration of wind power in=20
Iowa's future plans is Sen. Charles Grassley.=20
"Iowa may someday be considered the Saudi Arabia of wind energy," the Iowa=20
Republican said. "Wind is obviously clean. It's abundant, even though it's=20
not regular, but it's an abundant natural resource."=20
A Web site by the American Wind Energy Association, a trade association=20
representing wind power plant developers and others involved in the industry=
,=20
lists Iowa as the 10th windiest state in the nation.=20
But traditional utilities say that - because the wind does not blow all the=20
time and because there is currently no technology to store it - it cannot be=
=20
a large portion of the state's energy mix.=20
"You certainly couldn't depend on wind for a large portion of your supply,"=20
said Dean Crist, senior vice president of MidAmerican Energy, the state's=20
largest investor-owned utility.=20
"When they're talking about Iowa being one of the windiest states, that's a=20
year-round average," said John Ruff, spokesman for Alliant Energy, the=20
state's second-largest utility. "The National Weather Service charts show=20
that Iowa is good at three seasons out of the year as far as being windy.=20
"In the summertime, when we need energy the most is when there tends to be=20
not enough wind."=20
Crist and Ruff say until technology allows storage of wind-generated power,=20
it will be inherently unreliable.=20
State Rep. Ed Fallon, a Democrat from Des Moines, said the utilities' real=20
reason for hesitation is profit. Iowa utilities have fought wind power and=20
other alternative energy sources for years, he said.=20
"They can't control the wind like they can control energy generated by a coa=
l=20
plant or a nuclear plant," Fallon said.=20
"The bottom line is that the energy companies don't want to lose control. Th=
e=20
more we can move toward resources that don't subject themselves to control,=20
the less influence they're going to have," he said.=20
The American Wind Association says wind energy is cheaper to generate than=20
coal-fired or natural gas power.=20
Iowa currently gets 87 percent most of its power from coal, all of which=20
comes from outside the state, the association said. In 1995, the latest year=
=20
for which figures are available, the state's utilities spent $310 million on=
=20
coal alone, not including the cost of the plants themselves, it said.=20
By contrast, it costs about $750,000 to build a wind turbine, said Al Zeitz,=
=20
site superintendent for Enron Wind's Storm Lake II wind farm. Wind farms nea=
r=20
Clear Lake and Storm Lake also pay about $2,000 a year to each of 115=20
landowners to rent the land on which each turbine sits - a total of $640,000=
=20
per year, the Wind Energy Association said.=20
Ruff said those figures don't include the backup generation necessary to=20
provide electricity when the wind isn't blowing. That drives the cost of win=
d=20
power up and makes it more expensive than either coal or natural gas, he=20
said.=20
Since June, utilities have announced plans for three new power plants in Iow=

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were=20
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock=20
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed=20
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts o=
f=20
interest involving their official duties and personal finances.=20
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit,=20
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator=20
whose stock they owned.=20
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from=
=20
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential=20
conflicts was handled.=20
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the=20
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file=20
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which=20
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have=20
crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden.=20
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving thei=
r=20
personal financial interests.=20
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could=
=20
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most=20
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statement=
s=20
that led to the firings.=20
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in=20
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest stat=
e=20
bond sale in U.S. history.=20
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman=
=20
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the=20
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The=20
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through=20
with the purchase of utility transmission lines.=20
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a=20
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political=20
reform laws. Critics question the distinction.=20
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executiv=
e=20
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the=20
law."=20
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are=20
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Tryin=
g=20
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to=20
be doing."=20
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding=20
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administratio=
n=20
as it rushed into the power trading business this year.=20
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according=20
to state records.=20
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government=20
ethics laws.=20
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file eve=
n=20
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The=20
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly=
=20
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies.=20
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the=20
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key=
=20
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to=20
state when they bought the energy stocks.=20
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of=20
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a=20
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the=20
governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with=20
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and=20
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants.=20
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine=20
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San=20
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43=20
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.=20
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said=20
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. Mor=
e=20
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpin=
e=20
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records=20
available.=20
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these=20
stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an=20
interview.=20
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a=20
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power=
=20
and negotiating contracts, records show.=20
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility=20
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed=20
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had=20
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could=20
not be reached for comment.=20
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead,=20
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be=20
reached Friday by The Times.=20
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a=20
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early=20
days of California's electricity deregulation.=20
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contract=
s=20
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month,=20
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern=20
California.=20
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him=20
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the=20
stock a week ago.=20
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and=20
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value=20
each time.=20
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team=20
Thursday and fired.=20
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't=20
give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated.=
=20
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the=20
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger=20
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics an=
d=20
we're the pawns."=20
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other=20
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work=20
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power=20
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after=20
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's offic=
e=20
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment.=20
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1,=20
in her final days working at the electricity exchange.=20
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal=20
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources.=20
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state=20
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts.=20
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest.=20
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power=
=20
for up to 20 years.=20
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others=20

BOSTON - Not so long ago, investing in the energy industry meant buying=20
pieces of oil wells, hydroelectric dams and big, clunky utility companies.=20
But power deregulation broadened the possibilities, and the headlines from=20
the California power crisis have drawn entrepreneurs and investors into the=20
sector.
While traditional energy companies are attracting most of the attention,=20
there's growing interest in smaller companies in an emerging sector called=20
"energy technology": software, microturbines, Web-based electricity trading=20
and more.=20
The companies and venture capitalists are after the "$300 billion jump ball"=
=20
made possible by electricity deregulation, said Todd Klein, managing directo=

Their monopolies gone, power companies are being forced to improve=20

Meanwhile, technology companies are demanding cheaper and more reliable powe=

sources. Entrepreneurial talent is drifting to energy, and several=20
technologies developed in government labs are now commercially viable.=20
"We have been following these technologies 10 years, and they never were=20
anything more than science experiments," said Jeff Miller of Boston's Beacon=
=20
Group, which manages $1.6 billion in two energy venture-capital funds. "Now=20
you've got the demand coming from the marketplace and very serious managers=20
with very focused business plans."=20
Offsetting the flurry of enthusiasm is tighter funding from venture=20
capitalists. According to research firm Venture Economics, 77 companies took=
=20
in more than $1.2 billion in funding in the sector last year, but so far thi=
s=20
year just 17 companies have raised a total of $132 million.=20
David Lincoln, founder of EnerTech Capital in Wayne, Pa., told entrepreneurs=
=20
at a recent tech conference in Boston that nobody is in a hurry to make=20
deals, and the conditions that venture-capital funds impose now "were=20
virtually unheard of 18 months ago."=20
The California power crisis has grabbed the attention of the entire=20
investment community - every major investment bank is now tracking a sector.=
=20
"Everybody's backing out of the dot-coms and telecoms," said Bradley Johnson=

president of Washington-based Pepco Technologies. "They're saying the next=20
new thing is energy, but they haven't figured it out yet."=20
They are chasing some minor success stories like Chatsworth, Calif.-based=20
Capstone Turbine, which makes free-standing microturbines that allow=20
businesses to produce their own electricity. Company shares have traded as=20
high as $100, but have fallen to under $20, and the company still hasn't=20
turned a profit.=20
The next little thing is on the minds of venture-capital funds as much as th=
e=20
next big one. That means they're interested in technologies that don't=20
necessarily revolutionize how electricity is produced so much as help=20
traditional companies produce it and customers use it more efficiently.=20
"With the events which occurred in California and which are threatening to=20
occur in other parts of the country, people are focused on immediate=20
solutions to those problems," Klein said.=20
These solutions include systems to help companies manage their electrical us=

and flywheels that store electricity on site to guarantee a steady stream of=
=20
power to sensitive equipment. Other companies target the power companies=20
themselves, with everything from software to satellite meter-readers.=20
At the venture-capital level, backers tend to be looking for smaller=20

"green" companies.=20
"Everybody's supply-side," lamented R.W. Cushing, an entrepreneur whose=20
Austin, Texas, alternative-energy marketing company got the cold shoulder=20
from venture-capital funds at the Boston tech conference. "Nobody thinks in=20

But in fact, alternative energy firms raised $2 billion last year from IPOs=20

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update4)

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update4)

     (Adds new Enron comment in sixth, eighth, 14th and 16th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's top
energy trader, wants the Indian government to buy out its 65
percent stake in the Dabhol Power Co. project, although it's still
looking at other options, a spokesman said.
     Enron has invested $875 million in the $3 billion project,
spokesman John Ambler said, adding any sale would have to insure
Enron would completely recover its capital and other costs.
     Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's
sole customer, are in a seven-month dispute over $64 million in
unpaid bills.
     ``Enron does believe that selling its interest, either to the
government of India or to the project's lenders, is the best way
to resolve this protracted dispute,'' Ambler said.
     He added the company would continue to pursue all its options
under its power-purchase agreement with the board, including
international arbitration, and would try to protect the interests
of Dabhol's lenders, sponsors, fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners.
     The board, which is owned by the state of Maharashtra,
stopped buying Dabhol's power in May, saying it's too expensive.
The move came days after Dabhol announced it was beginning a six-
month notice period to end its contract with Maharashtra. Dabhol
halted production after the board stopped buying power.
     ``We're still pursuing other remedies in case the buyout
doesn't come through on acceptable terms,'' Ambler said. ``While
we remain open to discussing other solutions, we have serious
concerns about becoming embroiled in a perpetual series of
renegotiations.''

                             Partners

     The Financial Times reported earlier today that Enron is
interested in selling the stake, quoting Enron Chairman Ken Lay,
who was in India earlier this month. Lay told the newspaper that
partners General Electric Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.,
and closely held Bechtel Group might also want to exit the
project.
     GE Capital spokesman Ken Koprowski said the company ``would
give serious consideration to credible offers which would enable
us to realize our financial objectives for this investment.'' In
general terms, he said, GE has a ``long-term commitment to doing
business in India.''
     Bechtel ``would certainly consider an offer which would
enable us to obtain our financial objectives for this
investment,'' spokesman Alexander Winslow said.
     Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was quoted in the
Business Standard last week, saying he wants to resolve the Dabhol
dispute before he visits the U.S. in September.
     ``The Dabhol issue is clearly having an adverse effect on the
potential of other foreign investors in India, and we believe that
pursuing a buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a
timely manner, protecting India's investment climate as well as
the interest of stakeholders in the Dabhol Power Company,'' Ambler
said.
     He added that India's ``failure to reform the power sector
has made it extremely difficult for outside generators to
operate.''
     Madhav Godbole, the chief negotiator on the Indian side of
the payment dispute, said earlier today eight Indian states would
be interested in buying power from Dabhol, but not at ``anywhere
close'' to the rates the utility charged under the Maharashtra
contract. Dabhol rejected the proposal as ``unrealistic.''
     Ambler said there has been ``no real progress'' in producing
creditworthy buyers in India that can purchase power at a price
that's ``reasonable'' for a new power plant.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 74 cents to $46.10.
