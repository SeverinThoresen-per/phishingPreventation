Oracle 4th-Qtr Net Falls 23%; 1st Qtr to Fall Short (Update5)
2002-06-18 20:34 (New York)

Oracle 4th-Qtr Net Falls 23%; 1st Qtr to Fall Short (Update5)

     (Adds CEO comments in 16th, 18th and 19th paragraphs,
database and applications sales in 14th.)

     Redwood City, California, June 18 (Bloomberg) -- Oracle
Corp., the world's third-biggest software maker, said fourth-
quarter earnings fell 23 percent. Profit this quarter will miss
analysts' forecasts, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley said.
     Net income dropped to $655.9 million, or 12 cents a share,
from $854.9 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Sales in the
period ended May 31 declined 16 percent to $2.77 billion, beating
the average analyst forecast by almost $200 million, based on a
survey by Thomson First Call.
     Oracle shares, which rose as much as 15 percent on the better-
than-expected sales, gave up some of that gain after Henley's
forecast. The software maker has been mired in a slump for more
than a year as clients slashed software budgets. Corporate demand
for new programs remains sluggish, Henley said.
     ``Everybody's eyes popped open. The initial reaction was that
maybe it's not as bad out there as we think,'' said Ray Chan, a
software analyst at Franklin Templeton Investments, which manages
$279 billion and held 2.35 million Oracle shares as of March.
``Then they come out and throw cold water on us and say it really
is still tough.''
     Oracle shares climbed as high as $10.31 in trading after the
earnings report and then slipped back to $9.20. They fell 27 cents
to $8.93 in regular U.S. trading today and had declined 35 percent
this year.
     Excluding losses related to an investment in Liberate
Technologies Inc., Oracle said fourth-quarter profit would have
been $760 million, or 14 cents a share. On that basis, the company
was forecast to earn 12 cents, according to a First Call survey.
Sales in last year's fourth quarter were $3.29 billion.

                      Database Software

     Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, was founded in
1977 by Chief Executive Larry Ellison, who ranks as the fifth-
richest person in the world, according to Forbes magazine. Oracle
built its business by selling database software, used to store
libraries of information.
     Microsoft Corp. is the world's largest software maker and
International Business Machines Corp. is the second-biggest.
     Profit in the first quarter ending Aug. 31 will be 6 cents to
7 cents a share, Henley said on a conference call with analysts
and investors. The Redwood City, California-based company earned
$510.6 million, or 9 cents, in the first quarter last year.
     Oracle was expected to earn 9 cents a share, the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call.

                       New Software Licenses

     Sales of new software licenses will fall 15 percent to
25 percent from the first quarter of last year, when Oracle had
new software license revenue of $711.1 million, Henley said.
Revenue in fiscal 2003 will grow at a percentage in the single
digits, Henley said.
     ``Our assumption is that the U.S. economy will continue to
improve, at least gradually, but technology spending will not show
significant improvement probably for another six months,'' Henley
said.
     Fourth-quarter sales of new software licenses declined
29 percent to $1.15 billion from $1.62 billion, falling within the
range forecast by Henley in March. He had predicted a decline of
25 percent to 30 percent.
     Sales of new database licenses fell 29 percent to
$904.3 million from $1.28 billion. Sales of Oracle's applications,
used to manage business tasks such as accounting and inventory,
fell 27 percent to $245.7 million from $338 million.
     A Gartner Inc. report released in May said IBM had moved into
the top spot in the $8.84 billion market for database software
last year, with 34.6 percent of the market compared with Oracle's
32 percent. Ellison disputed those figures, saying user surveys
show that Oracle has a 50 percent to 70 percent market share.
     ``Our indications are that we're gaining share from IBM,''
Ellison said on the conference call.

                      Applications Software

     Oracle's applications, which compete with programs made by
SAP AG, PeopleSoft Inc. and Siebel Systems Inc., were originally
developed to make up for slowing database sales. Oracle's Web-
based applications, introduced two years ago, failed to deliver
growth because customers complained it had too many bugs.
     Ellison said that about 2,000 customers out of 13,000 Oracle
applications users are up and running on the Web-based version.
Customers have said the most recent releases are more stable.
     ``They're very happy with the latest versions of the
software, which continue to get more reliable and feature-rich,''
Ellison said.
