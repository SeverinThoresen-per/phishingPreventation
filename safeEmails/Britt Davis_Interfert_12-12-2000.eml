,=20

expected in Houston tonight.  If the jets are flying, I assume that Bernard=20
will get the originals by Thursday.

I would appreciate Bernard's office advising me by the close of business in=20

Parenthetically, I repeat my two prior requests that I be advised as soon as=

possible what qualifications are necessary for a liquidator, so that we can=20

this could be done within 60 days.  Echols signed the documents on December=20
5.  I accordingly anticipate that you and Bernard will be working with me to=
=20
get the substitution accomplished by no later than Monday, February 5, 2001.=
 =20
I have made myself personally responsible to my clients that this will be=20
accomplished timely. =20
