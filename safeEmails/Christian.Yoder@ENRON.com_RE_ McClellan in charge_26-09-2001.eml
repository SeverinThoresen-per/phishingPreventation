When McClellan came in, he was one of those big dogs, like Robin Gibbs, who =
"has the confidence of the Board."  We shall see what happenend to him.  It =
is a great story about chemistry and leadership. =20

I would add "dispute resolution" to the list. =20

I left off in my reading just after the Battle of Bull Run (mid-July, 1861).=
 . .so I have a few months of catching up to do. . . but I will be reading a=
long.  I will try to get current next weekend.

Now that Lincoln has fired Gen. McDowell, I am eager to read about the Linco=
ln-McClellan relationship.

Hey friends, we are rapidly approaching October, and in our communal reading=
 of Shelby Foote, October is where things pick up and go steadily forward fo=
r three years.  Let's dust off the big tome and read forward, month by month=
 together.  Elizabeth,  try not to read too much at a time,  just find where=
 he is in October of 1861 and read slowly.  This is a slow, savoring thing, =
not a rapid read for escape and entertainment.  With this big terrorist mess=
 going on and eveything, the lessons for both business and life are going to=
 be termendous. And, one final admonition, Elizabeth, when you get into his =
lengthy descriptions of troop maneuverings,  try not to be bored,  just take=
 a pencil and paper and kind of sketch out what you think he is saying,  the=
 basic directions and movements...use your skills for calculating early term=
ination payments and set offs.  All of these battles are big netting and set=
 off messes.  You are better qualified than you think to get into this stuff=
=2E  War is just a big messy chess game termination and  set off.  Try to ge=
t your imagination into it this way.   ----cgy

There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the lin=

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joinin=
g AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working out=
 of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete agree=
