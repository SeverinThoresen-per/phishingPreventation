John

I have 3 new associates coming into the group between now and July (includin=
g one person from the Trading Track program), for a total of six assigned to=
 me. I'll have 2 to 3 spots available in Sept./Oct. and then another 2 to 3 =
next Jan./Feb.. Five or Six associates at a time seem to be the most effecti=
ve number for our group.

I've turned down a large number of good candidates lately due to availabilit=
y. Let me know if you're expecting our group to accommodate more or if you n=
eed spaces reserved for Trading Track participants.

Thx

Berney
