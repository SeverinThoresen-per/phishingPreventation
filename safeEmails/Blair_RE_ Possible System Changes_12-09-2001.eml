    We can make the meeting Thursday afternoon if that is better for you guy=
s.  It will
    be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss.   Rick, FYI, Shell=
ey postponed her meeting
    until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting.  Poss=
ible means they do
    not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wante=
d to give us a "heads
    up" from a system perspective.  Hopefully that helps.  See ya'll in the =
morning.  Thanks. Lynn

Rick/Lynn, we have very few MPS contracts with imbalances and if we do, they=
 are relatively small - Larry B. takes a look at those each month. Because o=
f Close and since we will see Imbalance invoices and DDVC invoices for the f=
irst time, tomorrow is always a very busy time - we also may have some last =
minute measurement corrections to make so I would prefer to have the meeting=
 in the afternoon if we have to have it tomorrow.  Just let us know the crit=
icalness of this and we'll work around you and Rick's schedules.

Lynn,

9:00 may be a bad time for you and I if Shelley has her normal Wednesday sta=
ff meeting.  With everything that has gone on today, I believe she will want=
 to meet.  8:30 may be a better time if you are available.
=20
Does possible mean probable?  Or was it just a theoretical conversation you =
had with regulatory affairs?  Esther/Larry should be able to run a report sh=
owing us the MPS volumes on contracts.  I do not believe we will find very m=
uch volume. =20
