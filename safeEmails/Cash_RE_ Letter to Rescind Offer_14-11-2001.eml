The minimum number of days should be 21, and they should have 7 days to revo=
ke it.  Although the ADEA probably would not apply to A&A candidates, it cou=
ld be an issue for the rest of the organization.  Michelle

Attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment.=
  I have consolidated drafts done by Fran Mayes and Terry Bosien.  If you ha=
ve other forms that you think work better, please send them our way. I think=
 it will be useful to work from the same document across Enron.

Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others i=
n similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who=
 have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations. =20
