Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO=
 but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that Califor=
nia can "heal its wounds."=20
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or pos=
sibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-base=
d rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmis=
sion rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs=
=2E   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determin=
e this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff =
in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent bu=
siness rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect th=
is new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational a=
udit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and m=
arket based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a m=
arket is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Alan Comnes


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman=
 today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of=
 the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendu=
m to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding=
 market power).

RTOs=20

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that th=
e Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up t=
he RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1=
) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substa=
ntive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with =
the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The C=
ommission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and =
Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it i=
s time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that =
the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be incl=
uded in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to=
 address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 func=
tions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this go=
al, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from=
 October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues s=
uch as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmissi=
on planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the=
 Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Orde=
r No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public util=
ities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participati=
on.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by Decemb=
er 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this dec=
laration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked=
 on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not j=
oin RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that =
FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just =
and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that =
these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to=
 figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telli=
ng them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals,=
 because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed =
her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have the=
ir market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaki=
ng ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explaine=
d at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will prop=
ose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission provide=
rs and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also propo=
ses to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates,=
 not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and t=
ransmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption fro=
m the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to tra=
nsmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customer=
s.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs=
 that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the i=
nterim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the con=
trol room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO. =20

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards =
to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market=
 participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the ru=
les.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt ma=
y not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will=
 pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installe=
d capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an ord=
er on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that =
familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentati=
on, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be m=
ade public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe t=
hat some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability. =20

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enoug=
h wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commission=
ers better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential confli=
ct between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient su=
pply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes). =20

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding=
 of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts=
 as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers. =20

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he=
 will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will =
definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting=
 process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary =
of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you ha=
ve any questions.
