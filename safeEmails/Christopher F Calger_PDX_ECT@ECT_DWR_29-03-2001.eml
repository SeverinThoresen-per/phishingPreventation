I told DWR that Enron is not comfortable with the risk/reward of the transac=
tion.  They are reviewing the following modification:
=20
April Price: $200
May and beyond: $127
7 day payments through April 30
Standard EEI payment terms thereafter
Credit for Feb, Mar, April ($17MM) paid 7 days after investment grade bonds =
are issued=20
ENA has right to walk at any time for any reason up until the earlier of 7 d=
ays after bonds issued or Sep 1
Cal Reg Out (with termination payment) modified to include ballott initiativ=
es and CPUC orders

This is effectively a $5MM premium for a 4MMMwhr put swaption=20

I will update when I hear back from them.
