Chump,

I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
good news is, I am a third of the way through.

Did you ever get a car?

Frank

PS  Did you see WVU put up 80 on RU?  They suck!
