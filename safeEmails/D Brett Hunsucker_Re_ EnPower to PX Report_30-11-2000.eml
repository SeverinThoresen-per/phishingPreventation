All,

I told Mike Tully that I was here last nite when RT couldn't run the report,=
=20
but I could from my desk.  I explained to him the problems your group has=20
been having with this report.  I'm going to see if the RT guys (Monica and=20
Collin) can run a report today (per Mike's suggestion - to see if it's=20
possibly a day/nite thing).   I told Mike we'll monitor this prob for a whil=
e=20
to see if it gets better or worse.  In the interim, it's important to send a=
n=20
email to Dave Poston and Mike Tully (and copy me)everytime you have trouble=20
running or printing the report.   Please be as specific as possible in your=20
emails.  It sounds like it may be hard to pinpoint the cause of these=20
problems, so I want to start accumulating as much documentation as possible=20
for support.

There were some problems with the server last night (r: drive).  Can you=20
rerun the report and see if it works now?  The report is pulling Oracle data=
=20
from Enpower which works fine but it seems to have an issue finding the=20
caps.mdb.  It must be an infrastructure problem.

Thanks, Poston

The Enpower to PX Report is not pulling in the Caps deals.  The enpower part=
=20
is fine but there is nothing for caps. We obviously have a huge variance whe=
n=20
this occurs.......  Do you have any idea what might be causing this error?

Cheers
Jesse
