Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete ou=
r supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical producti=
on data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling p=
ermits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well =
characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate. =20

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services fro=
m IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a =
lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limit=
ed by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, wh=
ich will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of histo=
rical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able t=
o do this after we build the historical well information into our supply for=
ecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she =
is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated hav=
ing the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave he=
r a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to =
distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead o=
f having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll=
 need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily=
 Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland,=
 Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is =
going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris
