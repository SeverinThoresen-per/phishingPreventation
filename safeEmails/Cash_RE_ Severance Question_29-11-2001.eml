Last I checked, the severance plan is not currently listed on the intranet. =
 I wonder whether we should provide information regarding the current plan a=
s it may change in the very immediate future.  What are your thoughts?  Than=
ks, Cole.

The answers so far have stated current Enron Corp Severance Plans are in pla=
ce for those employees laid off.

What are the Enron Corp Severance Plan details? Where can they be found?

Thanks
