I was not hung over yesterday. I had 3 beers and went home. How about that=20
for self control? I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday=20
night and did some laundry. What a loser I am. I am going to Sylvan this=20
weekend. My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her=20
going away party. Meg's cabin parties are  generally epic gong shows. I need=
=20
to rest up this week. I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday. Now if I=20
get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants. I don't think you need t=
o=20
take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week. Can't you do=
=20
it yourself? I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept=
=20
person in the world.
