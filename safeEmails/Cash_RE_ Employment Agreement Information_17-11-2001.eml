Sheila:  I understand Tammy is on vacation.  We need  someone to review the =
database that Tammy Joyner maintains and determine if the Business Unit name=
d in the Employment Agreement is actually the Business Unit the employee is =
currently working for. If the employee is now working for a different Busine=
ss Unit, then we will need to make sure the Agreement gets assigned to the a=
ppropriate Business Unit.=20

So, we need a list of the employees whose Agreements to be assigned.

Please let me know who can get started on this project.=20

By copy of this e-mail, we are asking Fran Mayes, Jeanie Slone, Shanna Funkh=
ouser and Kim Melodick to let us know of any Agreements that need to be assi=
gned.  We need to do this clean-up as soon as possible.
