Murray/Chris:

Please proceed with processing ISO settlements for the December through Marc=
h period for Wheelabrator Shasta and Martell, Delano, Tosco and Arco.   I ha=
d planned on trying to process these statements in conjunction with a legal =
settlement with these clients, but after talking to legal, we concluded that=
 such a formality is not the best approach.

And, beginning with April, now that we are caught up, please immediately pro=
cess ISO statements for all California generator SC clients except Harbor as=
 Donna finishes here estimate and Caroline finishes her final.  I will work =
directly with Volume Management each month on the Harbor process as we have =
previously agreed.  Also, we plan on utilizing Volume Management to interact=
 with our clients to explain the Volume Management reports as it is my under=
standing we will no longer be using the "Kourtney Tool" to show the hourly I=
SO amounts. =20

Thanks!
