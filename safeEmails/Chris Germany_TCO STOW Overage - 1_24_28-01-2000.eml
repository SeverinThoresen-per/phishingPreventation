Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount=
=20
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn=
=2E=20
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dk=
t.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES=20
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.=20
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.=
=20
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage=20
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what=
=20
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling=20
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any=20
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the=20
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES=20
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES=20
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to=
=20
cause unnecessary pain.
