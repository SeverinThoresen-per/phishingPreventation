Jeff,

I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment doc=
uments.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have. =20

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out to=
day.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amo=
unt and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out th=
e release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder ap=
proval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from Pauline that was due M=
ay 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on he=
r 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   I=
f you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communi=
cating through you is working well.=20

Thanks for all your help.

Phillip
