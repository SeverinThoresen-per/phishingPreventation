A quick update from the litigation front.

I met with Scott Josey this afternoon.  As I understand it, we have visited=20
the data room and are preparing to make a bid next Friday for the gathering=20
system.  I told Scott that common-sense dictates that  if we file a lawsuit=20
now Tom Brown will probably tell us to take a hike and we will have no chanc=
e=20
whatsoever of winning the bid process.

That being said, we have decided to put a hold on any litigation until after=
=20
the bid process is complete.  Hopefully, we win the bid and the problems go=20
away.  If we do not win the bid process, we will plan to initiate=20
negotiations immediately with the new purchaser and, if necessary, file a=20
lawsuit to preserve our legal rights.

Ken Krisa is in the process of putting together damage calculations.  His=20
preliminary numbers indicate that, to date, we have been hurt to the tune of=
=20
$100,000.  While this is not much, Krisa is concerned that damages could=20
increase dramatically over the length of this contract.  I also just learned=
=20
from Gerald that Tom Brown has - at least for this month - allowed us to=20
nominate gas to Northwest Pipeline.  Very interesting.

I will continue to keep you apprised of all developments.
