In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let=
 me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I=
 can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this ty=
pe of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get toget=
her an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to co=
ntinue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale rig=
ht now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally=20

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting. =20

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as =
the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk=
 about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but ho=
w about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond th=
e "Building Guy". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there.=20

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's =
important to keep that almost "electric" atmosphere that surrounds the compa=
ny. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as s=
trong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone =
they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when=
 the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Ge=
t some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic d=
evices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting=
=2E Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that ha=
ppen might be worth it.=20

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with=
). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed=
=2E We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on th=
e street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and =
grow some more.=20

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to s=
how up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring peopl=
e running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about re=
cent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal=
 and regular.=20

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concern=
s but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.=20
