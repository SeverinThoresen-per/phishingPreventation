I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (=
before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  T=
hey call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check fo=
r the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we =
can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland.
