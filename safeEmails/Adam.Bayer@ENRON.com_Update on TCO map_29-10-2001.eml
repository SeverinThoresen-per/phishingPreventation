Brad,

I talked with Keith friday afternoon about the TCO map.  After 1:00pm friday=
, their server went down, and they couldn't access any of the files or save =
the changes to the Map.  He told me that if all goes well Monday morning, we=
 can see a map a little after noon.  I will work with him Monday morning to =
make sure I can have it for you asap.  Right now the map includes current da=
y and yesterday's information for the relevant market delivery zones.  Durin=
g next week, I will add interconnects to the map as well a storage fields to=
 present a complete picture.

Thanks,

Adam
