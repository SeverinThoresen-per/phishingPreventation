I think they will get the point. Rick

I don't think the emails are a waste of time but I do think the effort at EE=
S is a waste of time.

I believe the following series of emails is a colossal waste of time. Lets g=
et risks into books, risk systems working, options valued and into books.It =
seems we are trying to build a race car when there are no roads. Rick

Rick/Vince,

Should this not be a Credit/Research initiative while the business unit focu=
ses on originating good economic transactions?  Not to be complaining, but s=
houldn't EES be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste resource=
s on a project we are already moving forward on?  You can't run a portfolio =
model, unless you have deals in a risk system!  How complex do we want these=
 MODELS to be?  Behavioral implications on credit default?  They still don't=
 seem to understand.

Regards,
Bill


Mark - please attend.  You may want to include Martin to help EES understand=
 the complexity of their deals.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questio=
ns & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing thi=
s detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, thi=
s will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complex=
ity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for e=
ach contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platfor=
m for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the peop=
le in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of th=
ese comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back.=20

1)	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to r=
egularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-=
run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.

2)	The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credi=
t rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contra=
ct period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me t=
hat the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating t=
ransition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies chan=
ging their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints i=
mposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic=
 view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3)	Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that t=
he data used to develop the default probabilities are over different busines=
s segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are deali=
ng with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not get p=
aid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward'=
s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental f=
or a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a co=
mpany albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily=
 mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4)	A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for =
a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I me=
an that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates =
the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=
 contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. T=
his is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This wo=
uld be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables an=
d compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5)	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance=
 team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If =
we can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a=
 better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the c=
urrent parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop s=
ome of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6)	A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments. Bes=
ides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent error =
attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number gene=
rator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in =
this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect o=
f using different random number generators on Enron's aggregate credit risk?

7)	There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improved=
" analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20
