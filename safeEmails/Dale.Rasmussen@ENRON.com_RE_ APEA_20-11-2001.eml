I worked with Sara Shackleton on the swap for this deal.  She or someone els=
e in Mark Taylor's group is probably best positioned to make modifications.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

Dale --

I have been working with Jeff Dellapina at Chase on potential revisions to t=
he April '99 prepay -- he has requested an amendment to the original margin =
agreement.  Currently, we are required to post margin under the swaps once a=
 month.  Chase has requested a change to daily margining.  This change is be=
ing driven by our current credit issues, especially with the banks.  I have =
spoken with Evan Ward at APEA who is working with their lawyers on this.

I was wondering if I should work through you on this or someone in Houston (=
as you had worked on the original transaction).  Let me know your thoughts w=
hen you get the chance and I appreciate your help.
