The paper transaction you asked about in the staff meeting is with E.W. Scri=
pps Company, S&P rated A/stable.  The deal has not been signed and the contr=
act is still being negotiated.  We gave the marketers a preliminary approval=
 based on the existing credit threshold of $10 million.  We have not valued =
the exposure or credit reserve since we do not have final transaction detail=
s. =20
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
      Ken
