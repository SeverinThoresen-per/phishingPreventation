Lloyd,

I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM=20
load forecast model works. I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to=20
day sensitivity analysis. I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention=20
this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you=20
some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our=20
analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some=20
goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week=20
works for you.=20

Thanx,

Chris Dorland
