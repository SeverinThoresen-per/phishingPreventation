Hi Sara and Stephanie,

	It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage account=
s are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3=
) keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file=
 cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

	In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have =
tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for =
execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But onc=
e Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the d=
ocuments have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be t=
he keeper of records.=20
