CHILI COOK-OFFS
> >  NOTE: Please take  time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to th=
e first two judges, the reaction of the third is even better. For those of y=
ou who have lived in Texas, you know how True this is!  They actually have a=
 chili cook-off about the time the  rodeo comes to town. It takes up a major=
 portion  of the parking lot at the Astrodome! You will
likely want to read this behind closed doors because, if you are like me,  y=
ou'll laugh out loud.
