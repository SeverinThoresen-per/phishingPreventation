I am showing an amount due Harbor for April as follows:

Energy Sales - 	$2,325,290.00
Gas Cost - 	$1,680,275.51
Gross Profit	  $645,014.49

This is before any costs (other than gas) and the Enron Profit sharing are s=
ubtracted out.  This should be paid on the 25th.  Let me know if this number=
 matches your expectations.

Thanks
