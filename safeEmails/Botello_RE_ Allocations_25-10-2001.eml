	Karl,
	Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have spoken to Jim Saunders on the Ac=
counting allocation.  He is sending 3% of his time for the accounting inform=
ation flow to and from Co. 1195 as well as the investment accounting, and ti=
me spent on the reorganization accounting matters.  The remaining dollars of=
 the accounting allocation are from Rod Hayslett for the time he is spending=
 on Co. 1195 issues.  I hope this gives you the information you need.
	Mary

I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney=
 presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts a=
llocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone=
 mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline=
 Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 200=
2 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed som=
e light on the Accounting charge?

Thanks
Karl
