Tim and Murray,

Yesterday the real-time desk experienced dropped Terminal Server (TS)=20
sessions which impacted their productivity. Diana and Chip contacted the=20
network team in Houston to assist with troubleshooting the problem. Keith=20
Dziadek monitored the DS3 VPN connection between Portland and Houston and ha=
s=20
determined that it is the dynamic fail-over within the Enron Intelligent=20
Network (EIN) which is causing the dropped TS sessions. This dynamic=20
fail-over is a good thing. Our issue is that the sensitivity of the TS=20
sessions is so high that the time of the dynamic fail-over on the EIN causes=
=20
them to drop while all other applications (i.e. Enpower running locally in=20
Portland) are not affected.

Keith is meeting with his team in Houston as well as staff from EBS today to=
=20
form an action plan. Once the action plan has been established, Keith or I=20
will communicate what and when it will be done to you via email.

You can reach me on my cel if you have any questions.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

Subject: IT problems Sunday

Please be advised of a serious problem with Terminal Server!=20

We were all kicked out of Terminal Server consistently on Sunday.  At first=20
it happened about every half hour (9am to 10:30a.m).  Then it happened every=
=20
5 minutes.=20
Communication seemed slow.  We paged and called the Portland IT Team at=20
11:30  (Diana & Chip).  At 12noon Diana said Chip and Paul Kane were working=
=20
on it.   At around  12:30 Paul Kane called back and said "Vince" in Houston=20
was working on it.  We asked for Vince's Phone number and Paul stated that=20
Vince would call us instead. Vince called at about 1:00 and said everything=20
was now working.  Five minutes later we were still getting kicked out.   We=20
then paged and called Chip and he said he was trying to get ahold of=20
Houston.  At 1:30 we called the Resolution Center. They indicated they had n=
o=20
clue we were having problems. At 1: 45 we called Greg Marsalis in Houston an=
d=20
he said he was unaware of who was working on it, but was going to look into=20
it.

Greg did look into it and said they were still not able to pinpoint the=20
problem.  At this writing,(3:10p.m.) we are still not able to use Terminal=20
Server  and consequently are unable to transact with the ISO or to enter=20
deals in enpower.  This has also affected our connection to PX Trade App.  W=
e=20
are effectively prevented from taking advantage of market conditions in=20
California.  Earlier I had started to initiate some congestion relief  on th=
e=20
Palo Verde tie .  Cong was $225 to $250 at Palo and I was confident I could=20
take advantage by moving power out of SP.  I was unable to do anything in=20
Caps as I was kicked out every few minutes.

I feel the communication process regarding this problem has been flawed.  I'=
m=20
sure there is plenty of blame to go around .  I suggest we meet with IT  to=20
define a process where we will get immediate attention and results. =20

As of 3:20 we still have the same problems.=20

I am hoping this problem is isolated to Sunday.=20
