Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of=20
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we=20
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which=20
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me=
