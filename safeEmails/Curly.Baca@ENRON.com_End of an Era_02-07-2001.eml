Hi Ken and Jeff, =20

This email is being sent to let you know that my consulting contract with En=
ron has finally come to an end.  It has been a great experience to me to hav=
e been involved in the development of such successful international projects=
 as, Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala in 1993, Batangas and Subic Bay in 1992/93 =
in the Philippines and Guam in 1996, all of which are still contributing to =
Enron's earnings.  The opportunities provided me during the first 26 years w=
ith Northern Natural Gas/Internorth, from which I retired in 1988, and the l=
ast 11 years as a consultant for Enron Development and Enron International h=
ave made me a better person and I thank you both for this.

I will continue to  be involved in consulting and development of both power =
and natural gas projects, although on a more limited basis, and only as an i=
ndependent.

Should there be any need for my services or need to be contacted for any rea=
son, I can be reached at:
