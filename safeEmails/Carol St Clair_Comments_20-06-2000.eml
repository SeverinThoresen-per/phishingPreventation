Steve:
I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the onl=
y=20
open points relate to :

1. the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think=20
about what I e-mailed to you?

2. DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially=20
weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.

3. Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation=20
procedures.

4. DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I guess=
=20
we still need to discuss the :defenses" language because as I indicated to=20
you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.

I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.
