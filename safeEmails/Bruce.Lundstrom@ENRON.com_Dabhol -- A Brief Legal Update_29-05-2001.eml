Gentlemen --

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance te=
sting, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will dra=
w no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing avai=
lability declarations.  These letters turn the vague "recission" letter that=
 we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy Regula=
tory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position seems=
 to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC is th=
e appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship (e.g., d=
etermine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the misdeclaratio=
n claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction in this matt=
er and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping any arbitrati=
on proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a petition tor the Bo=
mbay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy pow=
er from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and GOM)=
 that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no reasonable =
hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Bruce
