David:
Here is the language that I would recommend for the "backup" letter that we=20
discussed this afternoon that our counterparties would send to us:


We hereby confirm that the confirmations that have been sent by you to us in=
=20
connection with the transactions that are described on Exhibit A attached=20
hereto correctly set forth the terms of the transactions between=20
_______________________ and Enron North America Corp. confirmed thereby.
 =20
In drafting this, I am assuming that the information that would be on Exhibi=
t=20
A would be something like the deals numbers and perhaps trade dates.

Carol
