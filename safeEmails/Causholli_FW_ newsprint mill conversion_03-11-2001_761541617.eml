Subject:	newsprint mill conversion

Hello Team,

Tembec Inc. may back a controversial $450-million project to convert the mot=
hballed Chandler newsprint mill in Quebec to make high-quality magazine pape=
r.  The Chandler mill was shut in 1999 by the former owner, Abitibi, due to =
high costs.   The Quebec government and the union-backed Quebec Solidarity F=
und now effectively own Chandler and are negotiating with Tembec to tie up t=
he conversion project by year-end.       A comfort to newsprint producers as=
 potential newsprint capacity is diverted else where at a time when the mark=
et is sitting in a supply glut.

Ayesha
