Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last We=
d.  Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Ma=
rket Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and=
 Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners a=
nd ind. transcos under).  The Commissioners did not make a decision, but sta=
ted that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting o=
n Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).

The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Gr=
id model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Gr=
ids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlor=
ida).  I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern ga=
ve them full grandfathering of current contracts.

Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the tra=
nsmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties o=
f the transco board.  The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit=
 ISO on top.  When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non=
-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then aske=
d why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.  There w=
as discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solut=
ions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their =
models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the tr=
ansco-type model.

Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for t=
his region of low cost power.

Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market=
 was already putting capital into transcos.
