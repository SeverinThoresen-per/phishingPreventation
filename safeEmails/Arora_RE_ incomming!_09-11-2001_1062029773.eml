Hey Nicole-
I got your email via Steve Wang-- he actually came to
me with it-- did you send it along?

It was great meeting you this weekend-- what a wild
night-- was really a great party.

I'm sending my resume along-- just had a page maker
competent friend tweak it--- looks pretty flash!

Thanks so much for your help-- I look forward to
seeing you again!

-Kelly
