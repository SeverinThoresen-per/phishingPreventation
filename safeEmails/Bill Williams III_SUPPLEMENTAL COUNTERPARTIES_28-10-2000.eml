Group,

Good afternoon.  I know we have all heard it before, BUT, it is still going=20
on...
When entering new deals in the supplemental section of caps, PLEASE make sur=
e=20
that the counterparty is ECTRT and NOT ECT.=20
When the counterparty is ECT, the money (OUR MONEY) would theoretically be=20
spread over the whole floor.

Again, I know that you have heard this at least 5 times already, therefore..=
=2E
IF you have any questions...PLEASE...ask me!!!

Bill
