FYI:
If you are having, or have had problems with Photoshop 6, use the link below
to (according to Adobe) make it run smoothly with the 6.0.1 update.
Good luck...-bert-

Adobe has provided us with an update for Version 6 that takes care
of many little, shall we say, mishaps.=20

To download the Photoshop 6.0.1 update onto a PC, go to:

http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/880e.htm

Then simply follow the instructions provided on Adobe's Web site.
Whether Photoshop is running as smooth as can be or if it's acting
up, we recommend that you install the 6.0.1 update; if not to make
the application run better, then at least to keep things current.
