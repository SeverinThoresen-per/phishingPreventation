David:

Thanks for the note.

I think you have captured the questions. As to question 1, however, I would=20
add that we are interested in an answer relating to on-line as well as phone=
=20
trades.=20

Mark, do you have anything to add?

We are looking forward to receiving your draft memo by the end of next week.=
 =20
I'll be in Japan next week, so if you have any questions, please foolow-up=20
with Mark.

Thanks, Alan

As we discussed, the following summarizes my understanding of the issues you=
=20
would like us to analyze and address in a memo (recognizing that some of=20
these issues cannot be definitively resolved at this point):

1.  After 10/1/00 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms completely, regardless=
=20
of whether there is a master agreement in place with the counterparty, and=20
instead advise counterparties of executed transactions through some type of=20
notice (or perhaps just through a daily transaction summary) delivered=20
through EOL?  If so, what (if anything) needs to be done to make this=20
procedure effective (e.g., amendments to electronic trading agreement)?

2.  Before 10/1 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms if the applicable master=
=20
agreement permits, or if there is no master, and provide notices through EOL=
=20
in the manner described above?  What are the risks of relying on clicks=20
evidencing a counterparty's transactions prior to the effectiveness of the=20
legislation?

3.  When dealing with a non-US counterparty, what (in general terms) is the=20
risk of following the procedures described above and not sending confirms? =20
In other words, if the counterparty is in a jurisdiction that does not=20
recognize electronic signatures as binding, is there a meaningful risk that=20
the counterparty will be able to avoid transactions (recognizing that this=20
question cannot be answered definitively without advice from local counsel=20
and that we will only be able to provide general observations)?  How does th=
e=20
analysis change if the counterparty has signed a master agreement governed b=
y=20
NY law?

4.  Are confirms required for physical transactions, pursuant to Article 2 o=
f=20
the UCC?  If so, must they meet any specific requirements?

5.  Miscellaneous other issues -- Can tapes of phone trades suffice as=20
electronic signatures under the federal legislation?  Is it sufficient for=20
one party to have the ability to store and retrieve records of the=20
transaction if the other party does not?

Please let me know if your understanding of the questions to be addressed=20
differs from the foregoing.  Thanks.
