Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058,=
 that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, i=
t was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into thi=
s and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please ge=
t back with him directly.  Thanks.
