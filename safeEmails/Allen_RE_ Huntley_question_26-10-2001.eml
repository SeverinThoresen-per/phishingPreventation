Phillip,

Could you please do me a favor?  I would like  to read your current title po=
licy to see what it says about easements.  You  should have received a copy =
during your closing.  I don't know how many  pages it will be but let me kno=
w how you want to handle getting a copy  made.  I'll be happy to make the co=
py, or whatever makes it easy for  you.

Thanks,
