FYI.  If you hadn't already heard, sounds like ONEOK has retained a new cond=

Subject:	Condensate Hauling

As most of you are now aware of, OneOk has hired a new trucking company to h=
aul off the pipeline drips and condensate tanks at our locations where drip =
is contained in the southwest Kansas area.
There has been an appointment set to meet with this new trucking company rep=
resentative on Monday, Sept. 24th at the Liberal Region office complex at 1:=
00 p.m.
The main focus will be for the teams involved to show the vendor where these=
 locations are that have previously been picked up by WEGO, and to make arra=
ngements for them to review previous schedules to haul these condensates. Wh=
at they have requested from the teams are maps to each point along with driv=
ing directions that are specific to each location. It comes to my mind that =
maybe we could provide them with a copy of our emergency response driving di=
rections that the teams should have on hand.
It was also brought to my attention, from my management, that this tasks nee=
ds to be handed off to the region operations management people so that they =
may coordinate the activities to their needs and schedules. It was also disc=
ussed that proper safety and procedure practices need be recognized by this =
new company which will be entering ETS facilities to provide their services =
for OneOk.
This would also be a prime opportunity to request that driver "run tickets" =
be left at all locations that drip is removed from. This would not only prov=
ide us with audit trail material for the future, but can give us documentati=
on for comparisons at the places where we have load-out meters installed.
With these suggestions considered, maybe we can go forward from here with ou=
r continued services and work ethics with OneOk to provide a more positive c=
ustomer relationship.
Thanks you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

RB


P.S.     All teams do not need to have a rep. present at this meeting. Randy=
 Howard, myself and a few others that I have asked to provide the maps from =
are all that will be needed.
