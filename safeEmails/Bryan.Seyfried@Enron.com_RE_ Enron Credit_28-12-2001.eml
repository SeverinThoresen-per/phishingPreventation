fax from genre....

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forw=
ard with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade lat=
e Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over =
the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbac=
ks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working o=
n our side.  Thanks.
