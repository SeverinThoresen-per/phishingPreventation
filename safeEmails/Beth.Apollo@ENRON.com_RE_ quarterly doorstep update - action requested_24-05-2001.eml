RAC is responsible for updating the database, but they must get info communi=
cated from the action item owners to know what to update.  Shona and I overs=
ee that process.

The purpose of circulating to the reviewers is so that we have the most upda=
ted info, and we encourage more updates before the presentation to Causey an=
d Buy next week.

I am not sure I see what is wrong with pushing these guys to get more update=
s in.

Certainly, we would communicate with any process owner BEFORE presenting to =
Sr management, if we feel that a major finding has been overlooked, in order=
 to get a better understanding of the status, and why there has not been pro=
gress, as a final back stop to ensure that the wrong info is not communicate=
d.

I think we are getting together late tomorrow.  Happy to discuss then. =20

Who is responsible for status in the database - updating has not been done, =
access has not been widely circulated so therefore we are at risk of informi=
ng people that open items have not been closed when they have been.

Can we discuss

Subject:	quarterly doorstep update - action requested

Sherri and I are in the process of putting together the quarterly update for=
 the doorstep reviews.  Sherri is concentrating on ensuring the finding stat=
us is the most current.  Please coordinate with her (this week if possible) =
regarding the findings in your offices if you feel the status listed in the =
database is not the most updated.

Also, if you have an outstanding report for a review that has been completed=
, please send me a copy of the draft.

Thanks

Shona
