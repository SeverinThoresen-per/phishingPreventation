Just wanted to let everyone know that I have ordered 50 boxes that are to be=

 these, please let me know because there are numbered stickers for each box =
that I will also need to give you along with directions on how the transmitt=
al sheets are to be typed up.  If you have any questions, please don't hesti=
tate to ask me as we want to make sure that we have followed the Record Cent=
er procedures correctly.

Thanks,

Raetta
