 Matt advised me today that John Nowlan and John Chismar have decided that=20
they want to try to settle this case before the joint survey takes place and=
=20
that they will likely appoint Paul Henking, their new head chartering person=
=20
in Singapore (formerly of Enron's Houston office) to contact Mitsubishi abou=
t=20
this.

A.  A number of new developments may have influenced this decision (although=
=20
I would rely on Matt's knowledge about this, as he actually spoke with Nowla=
n=20
and Chismar):

1.  SGS's Singapore lab  continues to struggle with trying to implement the=20
joint survey test program that Steve Jones, our chemist, wants to use.  In=20
order to determine if SGS is up to it, Jones feels that it will be necessary=
=20
to send Alan Goddard (another one of our experts) to SGS's Singapore lab and=
=20
assist in the trials, at an additional cost of about $7,250.  Goodard can't=20
leave for another ten days or so, causing further delay.  Goodard may or may=
=20
not conclude at the end of his stay that SGS is up to it.  ECT's other=20
options are clearly second choices in terms of cost and strategy.

2.  ECT's damages now appear to be harder to prove.  As to the Elang Crude=20
cargo at issue, ECT was recently able to calculate that it actually=20
reportedly made over $500,000 more than if ECT had sold the cargo to FGH. =20
ECT's big loss was having to substitute a naptha cargo for the Elang Crude=20
that FGH had rejected.  That loss is reportedly in the range of about=20
$1,300,000.  However, this seems to raise a number of issues:

(a)  Is this a recoverable consequential damage?  I haven't yet looked at th=
e=20
charter to see if there is any contractual limitation on damages.

(b)  can we prove that we in fact had to substitute naptha for condensate=20
(our contract with FGH reportedly requires us to sell the naptha at a big=20
discount)?  Our traders would reportedly have a tough time stating under oat=
h=20
that there was no condensate available; our key problem was lack of=20
confidence what the D3605 test would show even with condensate that we=20
thought was on spec.

3.  ECT has determined that it may need to recharter vessels from Mitsubishi=
=20
in the future for strategic routes.

There may be other reasons for Nowland and Chismar's decision, and I invite=20
Matt to report on anything else of which he is aware.

B.  Settlement Strategy

     Matt advises that Nowlan and Chismar want to offer to settle for a net=20
payment of $250,000 by Mitsubishi to us (Matt, I would appreciate your=20
helping me out with the numbers on how that figure was calculated).  I have=20
told Matt in the past that I believe a drop hands agreement between ECT and=20
Mitsubishi would be a very good result, and I think he and I agree.  David=20
Best also agreed with a drop hands agreement when I mentioned it to him in=20
the past (although he will not be aware until receipt of this e-mail of the=20
recent revelation regarding the damages figures).

I will keep you advised.
