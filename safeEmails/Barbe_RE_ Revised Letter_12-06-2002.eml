Chris and Robin,

Besides the storage inventory, we have two transport imbalances that we also=
 will need to sell.  See the below note.

Thanks,
Ruth

I spoke with Doug Wilkinson who is the Controller over at Bridgeline and he =
confirmed his volumes on the firm contract (96034592) to be 18,159 due ENA a=
nd the IT contract (96034796) to be 6,212 due ENA.  He is in agreement that =
these balances exists on these contracts and that these volumes are due ENA =
per their records as of today. I also mentioned to him that I knew where the=
 difference was of the 19 mmbtus that we are off (August 2001, meter 843019)=
=2E   If I need to do anything else, please don't hesitate to let me know.  =
Thanks!

Rita,

Do you have a contact over at Bridgeline that you can call and get each of t=
hese balances reconciled?  Ideally, ENA and Bridgeline need to have the same=
 numbers.  If we cannot agree, we will have to have Chip resolve the differe=
nces when he completes the deal.

Thanks for your help and keep me posted,
Ruth

Ruth,

With the adjustments made and the discrepancy that I found and will have cor=
rected shortly, I am within 2 mmbtus of Bridegline's number.  My balance for=
 storage contract  96034600 is 1,930,554 mmbtus due ENA.  My balances for co=
ntracts 96034592 and 96034796 are 18,178) mmbtus and 6,212 mmbuts, respectiv=
ely, both due ENA.  The diference in Enron's number and Bridgeline's number =
on contract 96034592 is 19 mmbuts I believe needs to be corrected on B/L's s=
ide.  If you need any supporting documentation, please do not hesitate to co=
ntact me.

Thanks,
Rita

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sente=
nce given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovere=
d during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA=
 on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored =
under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated =
at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Hol=
dings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to =
get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Ruth
