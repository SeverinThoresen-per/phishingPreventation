George -

This note is to confirm that Murray O'Neil's latest expense report (roughly =
$2,000) was for valid,  POST-petition business.  He travels from Portland wh=
ere he is based, to Houston, as needed, to work on Power settlements and vol=
ume management for EES, and these expenses are for airfare, hotel and meals =
for the week prior to the Christmas holiday.  Per our discussion, I assume t=
hat these were held up by the system due to the $5,000 limitation, for furth=
er review.

Please have a member of your team expedite the review of this expense report=
, so that it can be released today, if possible.  I assume that they will co=
nfirm to us that the report has been released so that Murray will no longer =
be behind in his expense reimbursements, since he will be traveling to Houst=
on again (and therefore incurring expenses) on Monday.

I understand that Enron is not issuing cash advances, but that once the init=
ial backlog of expense processing is done, that reimbursement will occur muc=
h more quickly, now that we are in the post-petition environment.

Thanks so much,

Beth
