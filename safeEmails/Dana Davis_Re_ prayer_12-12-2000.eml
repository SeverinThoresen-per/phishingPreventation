I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn
