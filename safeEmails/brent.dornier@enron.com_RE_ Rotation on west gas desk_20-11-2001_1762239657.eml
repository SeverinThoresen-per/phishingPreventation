Keith,

I hope that you had a good time in London... Scotland was fantastic. I'm rea=
lly glad that I got to go before I leave. Speaking of which, I received word=
 from Karen Buckley that I'll be joining West Gas. I must admit, I'm pretty =
excited about it. I think that my start date will be December 5, although I =
haven't received any confirmation of that...

See you soon,

-Brent

Going to Scotland for the weekend....Why the hell are you moving back to Hou=
ston?  In 2 months you'll be going to Galveston for the weekend.  Anyway, I'=
m arriving early Friday morning and plan on reaching Enron around 1:00 PM.  =
If it works for you, lets plan on meeting around 1:30 PM.

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon.=
 I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Sc=
otland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Brent:

Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibi=
lty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and mys=
elf on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a tradi=
ng candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the progra=
m requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you=
 can spare a few minutes.

Thanks
Keith Holst
