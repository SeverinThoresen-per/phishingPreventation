Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on even=
ts, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to be =
unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management thin=
g.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of the=
 back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed to off=
set a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  this pr=
ototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a very hig=
h quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlement proces=
ses in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue financial sor=
cery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenanigans  see=
ms to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficult to isola=
te and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad guy and firing=
 him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of corruption seems=
 to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasingly likely, a t=
akeover from without.   ----cgy =20
