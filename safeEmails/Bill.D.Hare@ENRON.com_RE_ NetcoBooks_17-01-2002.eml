Bill, just a follow up to the book list that you sent. Regarding West Hourly=
, it looks like it is NETCO-ST-HOURLY. This will work, but the problem is th=
at it doesn't differentiate between the west and east trading groups. Am I r=
eading this wrong? My request was for the short name to be NETCO-W-HOURLY.

Melba, in response to one of your emails to me, West Hourly is set up as not=
ed above.

John
