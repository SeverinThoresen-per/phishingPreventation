Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4=
=20
capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We=20
have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. =20
According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's=
=20
meter in Zone 4.

I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we=20
need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.

I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it=20
because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.
