=09
	I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  co=
ming that
	we need to discuss in the morning.

	1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing
	2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator
		calculation. (as well as fuel)
	3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbal=
ances on MPS contracts.

	Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If =
that
	doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn
