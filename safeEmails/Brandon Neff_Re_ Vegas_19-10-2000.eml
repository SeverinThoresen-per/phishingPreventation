A few more details and a few less people.  It looks like we are going to hav=
e=20
between 5 and 7 going.  It's kind of important that those of you I haven't=20
heard from in the past week or so let me know so that I can get another room=
=20
if necessary.

Porter - I am counting you in, but need to confirm
Rogers - I am counting you in, but need to confirm OB
Stabell - I didn't count you or Iaia, need to confirm

I have got a room reserved at the Flamingo for Thurs - Sun.  I rate it a=20
B+hotel, but the other ones are $300-400 for Friday and Saturday.  It is=20
older but is on the strip by Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian,etc.  I am still=20
working on the Venetian, they will comp Thursday night but say they have no=20
availability F&S because of a conference.  I think there is still hope, but =
I=20
probably won't know until the week we go.

The rates at the Flamingo are  59, 169, 169 for 2 double beds.  If there are=
=20
5 of us, maybe we squeeze depending on what everyone wants, if there is more=
,=20
I say get another room.  At 169 a night, its only $100 or less per person fo=
r=20
both nights, not bad.  If you want your own bed, its going to be an extra $5=
0=20
for the weekend.  I don't mind paying it, so if anyone is interested let me=20
know ASAP.  Otherwise, there is a strong chance you will be sharing a bed or=
=20
on a couch.

Arrivals
Thursday night  Hilgert, Neff
Friday AM  Gardener
Friday PM  Martin, Rogers, OB, Porter?

I think the first 3 will be playing golf on Friday, we can probably play=20
again Saturday if you all want.  I'll set up times, but confirm that you are=
=20
going to play and feel free to suggest a course.  Expect green fee to be $75=
=20
at the cheapest, more likely $125 -150, but you do get what you pay for.


Adios
