Carol, pursuant to my second phone message from this afternoon, I am
providing you with the number of an alternative contact in our Contracts
Department:

Angela Weber, Contracts Department
phone:  (816) 527-1293
email:  aweber@utilicorp.com

To recap, the concern is that Board Resolutions are not in the ISDA as
"Documents to be Delivered".  I would propose that both parties provide them
anyway, regardless of whether they are listed in the ISDA, in order to avoid
having to redraft and re-sign the agreement please discuss this with Angela
in my absence.  Please have yourself or Susan give Angela a call to discuss.
Again, my apologies for the "11th hour'' nature of these concerns.
