Rick,

Both Tanya and David Port are out of the office today and neither will be ab=
le to call in.  In speaking with Tanya this morning, she would like to repor=
t on her discussions with Jim Fallon and the EBS Team in London when she ret=
urns on Monday.

Given that two key team members are out-of-pocket, I recommend we postpone t=
he RAC EBS Team Meeting until Monday afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any objections or conflicts and I'll confirm =
or reschedule, as appropriate.

Thanks,

Chip
