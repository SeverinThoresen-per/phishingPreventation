Subject: Update on Duke Energy

We currently have the following outstanding confirmations with Duke:

1. Duke Energy Marketing Ltd. Partnership (Canada)    601 confirmations

We were delayed in calling this c/p because ECC was forwarding an 'approved'
list of c/p for us to contact. Duke is on the 'approved' list.

I faxed a list of outstanding confirms to Manolo recently, and am calling hi=
m=20
today to follow-up.
Manolo Martinez may be contacted at 403-297-9889.

2. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing (Houston) 321 confirmations

Theresa Copeland has been my contact at 713-260-8540.
In late 99/early 00, she said that an arrangement was made with Diane Swiber=
=20
whereby Duke didn't need to sign or send confirmations back to us, but the 3=
21
above represents financial deals only.

Theresa said that if there are any discrepancies with any confirmations, tha=
t=20
Duke is able
to mark any changes on the confirmations, and fax these back to us within 48=
=20
hours,

If you would, briefly discuss your history with Duke,=20
