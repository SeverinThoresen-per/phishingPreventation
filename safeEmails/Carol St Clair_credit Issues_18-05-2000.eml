Brant:
I need your help in answering the following questions:

EL PASO

Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000?
What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it=
=20
apply to the parties and their credit support providers?

OCCIDENTAL

Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?

Carol
