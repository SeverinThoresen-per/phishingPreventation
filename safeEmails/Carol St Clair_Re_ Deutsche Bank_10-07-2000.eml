Thanks.  I expect to get a new draft of the Schedules from DB later today. =20
As for the crib, it is perfect and Bill and a friend managed to put it=20
together.  Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will hav=
e=20
a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there i=
s=20
that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done=20
with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this=20
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on. =
=20
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A=
2=20
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need=
=20
to run this by someone else please let me know.
