Subject:	Internet outage 5:45 PM Tonight and 6:45 Tomorrow
Importance:	High

Internet Outage:

There will be a very temporary (10 seconds or so) internet outage at 5:45pm =
tonight  as we switch from using the PGE route to the Enron Houston route.

The IT contact for tonight is:

Chip Cox
503.464.8916=20
503.703.0536

PGE is doing maintenance on their firewall tomorrow and to avoid a prolonged=
 outage we will be using a different path to the internet.

Tonight we are just testing the alternate path and will be back on the PGE r=
oute around 6:00 PM tonight after testing.

Tomorrow, around 6:45PM, we will once again reroute our traffic to Enron Hou=
ston's Internet path while the PGE route is down for about 2-3 hours.
This will again cause a very brief outage that will most likely go unnoticed=
 by most.  After PGE has completed their work, we will jump back over to the=
ir service.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
