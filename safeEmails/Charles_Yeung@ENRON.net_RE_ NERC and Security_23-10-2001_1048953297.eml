I have been making statements about this concern through emails and some mee=
tings - with little impact.  These decisions are made solely between NERC st=
ffers and the Regional Councils. They are not getting to where we can vote o=
n it. We need a stronger voice to get this in front of the MIC and OC. I wil=
l try to rally EPSA members behind this issue.=20

NERC is apparently moving forward aggressively on their initiative to restri=
ct access to market information.  Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN =
Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and =
NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.  A=
 new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged t=
hat marketers have "higher turnover" and "loose lips," and were using this a=
s a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (poten=
tially even from legitimate consumers like us).

If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our =
opinions on this issue.  It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed=
 sufficiently.  Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC mee=
ting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?  I =
think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry =
"de facto" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is con=
sent (even if we're not told about the changes).  We should probably talk ab=
out this all today on our conference call.
