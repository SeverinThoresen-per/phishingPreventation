Julia:
I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each=20
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps=20
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches. =20
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at=20
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not=20
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes=20
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago jus=
t=20
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going=
=20
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very=20
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in=20
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are=20
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected. =
=20
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel=
=20
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction wit=
h=20
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that=20
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think=20
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just=20
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home=
=20
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him=20
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are=20
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up=20
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hop=
e=20
to see you soon.  Take care.

Carol
