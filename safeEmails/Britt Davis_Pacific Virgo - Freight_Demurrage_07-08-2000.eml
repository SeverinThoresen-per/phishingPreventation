Please convey to Owners of Pacific Virgo as follows:


As owners are aware, Enron has suffered considerable loss and damage arising
from the contamination of condensate loaded in good order and condition but
delivered contaminated.

It is clear that Mitsubishi, as time chartered owners, would not be now=20
claiming
freight or demurrage but for the contamination. There can be no argument abo=
ut
this.  Since Enron is holding Mitsubishi fully liable for the contamination
according to the terms and conditions of the relevant charterparty, Enron=20
takes
the view that it does not have a liability to pay either the freight or
demurrage.  Should Mitsubishi disagree, Enron suggests that all disputes are
referred to arbitration pursuant to the relevant clause of C/P.  Enron will
almost certainly be commencing arbitration once the joint analysis results a=
re
known in order to recover their losses which have not yet been fully=20
quantified.
We respectfully suggest that Mitsubishi reviews its entitlement to freight a=
nd
demurrage after the joint testing.

Please acknowledge.

Enron, Singapore
