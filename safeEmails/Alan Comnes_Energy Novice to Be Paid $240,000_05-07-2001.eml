the field. State officials say she is doing a good job.=20


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with=20
barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head =
a=20
team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply.=20
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive=20
bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chie=

energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades.=20
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state'=
s=20
day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year.=20
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it=
=20
faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power=20
buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered=
=2E=20
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the=20
largest.=20
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract.=20
She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that=
=20
works long hours to keep California's power flowing.=20
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water=20
Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had=20
been impressed by her savvy.=20
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April=20
after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach,=20
recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday.=20
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an=20
aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game.=20
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said=
=2E=20
"Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the=
=20
rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]."=20
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the=20
six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major=20
utilities--struck with the governor.=20
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said.=20
"David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan=20
came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the=20
standard formula."=20
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated,=20
around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling=20
power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between=20
contracts and deliveries," according to her contract.=20
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experienc=
e=20
in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was =
a=20
trader and power scheduler, not a manager.=20
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an=20
administrative manager for the company.=20
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a=20
pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining=20
Mieco.=20
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not=20
only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field.=20
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000,=20
including expenses, by April 2003.=20
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a=20
century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration,=20
Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is=
=20
being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's=20
accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000.=20
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals.=20
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacrament=
o=20
Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200=
=20
an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He=20
worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the=
=20
Sacramento agency in 1987.=20
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that=20
calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a=20
century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power=20
Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997.=20
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern.=20
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and=
=20
she has the ability. She was doing a similar job."=20
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January,=20
when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of=20
government to buy power.=20
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E,=20
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no=
=20
longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the=20
Department of Water Resources.=20
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the=20
division are consultants. The rest are state employees.=20
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day=
=20
ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that=20
extend no more than three months.=20
