Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to=20
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk=20
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home=20
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of=20
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising=20
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you=20
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.
