George,

There seems to be a problem with MIPS while trying to actualize
the January 2000 data (Y2K related). In order to actualize JAN
POPS has to manually load the actual files into POPS, the=20
side effect of this is that some of the FEB data may be loaded
with numbers that are old. This will be rectified as we complete
loading the JAN actuals and then load the most recent MIPS
measured prelim numbers for FEB.

POPS is currently processing the MIPS files in the order they
were received, we should be done with this today. Please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow.

thanks
Romeo
