Hey don,

1. We have a new solution for the db which will work in outlook.  They wante=
d to know if we will still need the historical data and they will need to ch=
eck if we are allowed to take that data.  Do we need the data?  Do we still =
have business from that when we become UBS?=20

2. Please put in an erequest for a public folder.  Goto erequest and choose =
applications/ms outlook/public folder...put notes that you will use to repla=
ce old "east power trading" ln db.



Let me know so I can get it done.
