Hi,

If you are not currently logging all documents sent to Joe, please begin=20
doing so again.  I know the volume being sent downstairs is enormous, but we=
=20
need to do this to cover ourselves.  I don't think we have been for about a=20
month, but please start this again tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brenna
