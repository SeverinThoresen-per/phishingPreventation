	I have not heard back from Lazaro as to our request for an extension of tim=
e.  I left a call for him today, asking him to call me back tomorrow morning=
=2E

	I have received a copy of the Court's file from Lazaro by letter dated Octo=
ber 26.  It is thin, but indicates that this suit clearly fit within the fra=
mework of a larger strategy by Grynberg involving Quinque.  Keep in mind tha=
t what we have been served is a first supplemental petition:

	1.  There is an original petition that was filed July 15, 1999, which purpo=
rts to be a class action suit on behalf of Zapata County and all other simil=
arly situated counties and parishes in the United States of America for deli=
quent ad valorem taxes and other damages.  Although I have not compared the =
original petition in Zapata County with the petition in Quinque, both the li=
st of defendants and allegations of mismeasurement appear to be the same.  T=
he plaintiff's attorneys seem to be the same.  Although I have not compared =
the original Zapata petition with the first supplemental Zapata petition, I =
see no mention of RSM Production or the Zapata County Independent School Dis=
trict in the original petition, although both appear in the first supplement=
al petition.  There is no class action allegation in the supplemental petiti=
on (although it does mention gas produced in Zapata county and, cryptically,=
 in other counties).  I have never seen a "supplemental" pleading that dropp=
ed class action allegations and defendants, and added plaintiffs.  The first=
 supplemental petition is more correctly titled an amended petition.  Perhap=
s the plaintiff's attorney had a reason for not calling attention to the rad=
ical change in the nature of a lawsuit.

	2.  On March 21, 2000, the Court issued an order on plaintiff's verified mo=
tion to retain case.  The order was based on a motion by plaintiff for itsel=
f and all other similarly situated counties, alleging that the same group of=
 defendants had been sued in Quinque and removed the case.  "Judicial econom=
y will result in the present action by waiting for a ruling in the Kansas li=
tigation, thus avoiding the same procedural motions in this case."  Plaintif=
f moved for and was granted abatement of the case for 6 months until Septemb=
er 21, 2000 or until 30 days after a ruling on the motion for remand in the =
Kansas litigation, whichever comes first. =20
 =20
	3.  On March 12, 2001 (almost a year later than item #2), one of plaintiff'=
s counsel, the law firm of Farnsworth and Von Berg, L.L.P., here in Houston,=
 moved to withdraw as counsel for non-payment of fees by Jack Grynberg.  The=
 motion notes as follows:  "In November 1999, following filing of this lawsu=
it, Movants and Jack Grynberg and RSM Corporation, as representative of Zapa=
ta County Independent School District, severed their attorney/client relatio=
nship because Jack Grynberg failed to pay attorney fees as per their contrac=
tual agreement."  There is nothing in the file reflecting even a proposed or=
der, much less a hearing on the motion.

	4.  The Court's docket sheet indicates that on August 30, 2001, the case wa=
s called again by the Court and "reset for 9-27-01" (I am assuming that this=
 is for another DWOP docket).

	5.  On September 25, plaintiffs filed their first supplemental petition by =
fax.

	6.  On September 27, the case was called before Judge Robert R. Eschenburg,=
 and Jose A. Lopez (one of the plaintiff's attorneys) attended, and a schedu=
ling order was to be filed.

	7.  On October 1, about 20 citations were issued on various defendants.

	8.  On October 19, a letter to Jose Lopez from Margaret Timmons was filed. =
 The file sent to me does not contain a copy.

	9.  On October 22, the Court's docket literally shows that citation was ser=
ved on Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., "Not executed."  I think that means that t=
he return of service on Enron Gas Marketing Inc. was filed.

	I will make copies and have them distributed.

	Britt
