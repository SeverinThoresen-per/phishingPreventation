	In reference to this weekend's activity, I contacted Bob Superty as to thei=
r plans for nominations and explained that payment must be received today to=
 permit any transportation. My call was returned by Suzanne Calcagno who adv=
ised they were not in a position to make payment but hoped to know more next=
 week. I advised that we would require the prepayment and she understood and=
 appreciated our call.

	If any questions arise this weekend, please feel free to contact me.

	My phone numbers are Home - 281-320-2563
                                              Cellular - 281-731-0692
