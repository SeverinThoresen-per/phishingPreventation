The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA=20
(Transportation Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply t=
o=20
this imbalance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from=20
usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by other=
s=20
to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport=20
this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is=20
responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future=20
imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this=20
current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Chris
