I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs marketing thi=
ng".  Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a =
few things.  Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodica=
lly acknowledge the existence of marketers. I vote for the latter.  The empl=
oyee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online m=
aterials talked about "trading staff and technology", the ubs spokesperson t=
oday in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the=
 traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".  Tim's=
 assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading comp=
any now"!! The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader=
 meetings".  The master agreement references the trading business.  NETCO.  =
In isolation, all of these things are trivial. Add it all up, we have a prob=
lem.  We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want =
to lose more in 6 or 12 months.

This is not a ying-yang issue:. I am thrilled about this deal closing, but w=
e need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive p=
ersonnel.
