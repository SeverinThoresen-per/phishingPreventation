Anna -

The fitness reimbursement is for gym/health facility memberships only.  If=20
the yoga classes are part of a fitness club, they certainly can be included=20
in the reimbursement up to $25.00.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Amy,

I am interested in taking yoga classes, and typically the yoga centers do no=
t=20
charge an annual sign on fee.  There are, of course monthly fees or fees by=20
the class.  Will I still be able to get reimbursed $25 / month (but still no=
t=20
qualify for the $100 annual fee reimbursement)? =20

Please let me know, as there are others also interested in yoga class=20
reimbursement schedules.

Thanks,
Anna
