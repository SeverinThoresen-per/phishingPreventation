I have not yet contacted our tax group about this.  I think that the easiest=

thing to do is for you to give me Sheri's phone number and I will ask someon=

from our tax group to contact her.  It probably will be Rhett Jackson.

Carol,

Further to our conversatiaon yesterday, I would like to get Sheri Dunn, from
the Weyerhaesuer tax group and a tax representative from Enron on the phone
sometime (hopefully today).  Sheri is available at 10:30 Pacific time (=3D1:=
30
est,  12:30 Central)  today.  Do you think we can work with that?

Thanks,

Sandy Morrison
