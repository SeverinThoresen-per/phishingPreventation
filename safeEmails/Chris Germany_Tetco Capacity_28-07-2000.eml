Here is what I think we have for August

Contract MDQ  Comment
892510  16136  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3
892511  7426  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3
893145  5000  Access to M3
892875  9496  Access to M3

892872  18705  Access to M2
893741  5000  Access to M2


Now the really bad contract
Offer #17378 from Nat Fuel.  Judy or Scott will need to tell you the contrac=
t=20
number on this one.  There seems to be a really big difference between=20
Ela/Etx and M1.  I think you can physically flow 5000 to 8000 from Access to=
=20
M2.
