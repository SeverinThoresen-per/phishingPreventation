Jim, I promised you some contact details.

Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning o=
f
the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis.  I'm a Senior
International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn m=
y
hand to.  Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New Yo=
rk,
is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work togeth=
er
if the opportunity ever arose.

In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the Bri=
tish
Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the
transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, t=
he
new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take
forward its well-known private finance programme.  So you can see that I've
finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall.

Contact details are as follows:

Mobile              44 7802 655 605

At Partnerships UK  44 20 7273 8341 (direct)
               44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who ca=
n
usually be relied upon to know where I am)
               44 20 7273 8383 (switch)
               44 20 7273 8367     (fax)
               e-mail:  adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk

At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct)
               44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am w=
hen
I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there)
               44 30 7676 6000 (switch)
               44 20 7667 2487 (fax)
               e-mail: as above

Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best=
 to
send to both addressed at once.

All the best

Adrian
