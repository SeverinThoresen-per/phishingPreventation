Michelle,

	I forget that you started with the team after I quit working on the TW Agre=
ements; here's a brief update on what our "normal" process was previously.  =
We can change anything if you've found a better process...

The Deal Capture Team (Craig & Esther) processes all FTS discount related am=
endments for TW Marketing.  The Contract Group processes the new (base) agre=
ement and any POI/MDQ/TERM type changes.  All FTS service requests still go =
to Contracts and, after the Capacity/Credit issues are completed and the con=
tract printed out, the entire contract folder is forwarded to Deal Capture f=
or additional processing (all firm contracts/amendments get sent to Deal Cap=
ture for review).  Deal Capture gets with the Marketer to determine if a Dis=
count is being offered and then creates the Discount Amendment, Routes it fo=
r approval (if needed) and Tenders all documents to the Shipper.  Deal Captu=
re is responsible for obtaining all approvals other than Capacity and Credit=
=2E  When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shipper, Deal C=
apture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for activation =
and to complete all additional distribution and processing.  Let me know if =
you have any concerns or questions.  As the first few deals go through, we'l=
l need your feedback to see if the process needs some adjustments.  Thanks f=
or all your help...

Craig
