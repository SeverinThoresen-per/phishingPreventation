To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself=20
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high=20
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel=
,=20
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

Andy
