Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire
trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.

In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf
Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as
to not offend international students.

I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American
citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we
are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist
attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the
majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely
settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct"
crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was
offending others.

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's
population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;
however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our
country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.

First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to
offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural
community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national
identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own
language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way"
has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by
millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,
bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo
Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.

We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any
other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --
learn our language!

"In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,
Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is
engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is
printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and
women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly
documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to
be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is
certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.

God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,
and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection
as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God
offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your
new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.

We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave
our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my
national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and
wherever I
choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam,
then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.

The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of
it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we
really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are
Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle=
=2E

Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion
about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every
opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and
griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,
I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,
the  right to leave.

Barry Loudermilk
If you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!!
It is time to take a  stand!!
