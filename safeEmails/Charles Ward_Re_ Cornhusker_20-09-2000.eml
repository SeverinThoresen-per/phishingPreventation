Richard Sanders is now examining the SPC Maintenance Agreement and the=20
individual labor agreements re our warranty view.  We should have a quick=20
view by tomorrow cob.  If we feel that these invoices are our full=20
responsibility and correctly due and payable, we shuld re-examine the=20
purchase and sale agreement w/ Tenaska and determine whether we believe a=20
faulty disclosure was made or whether we should eat it.

As for the parts, I'm looking to James Armstrong to determine whether there=20
are any accounting, spare parts on order, or other irregularities for which=20
we should hold back on settling the working capital.

We might have a difficulty holding back upon the working capital true-up if=20
the disclosure is unresolved or we don't have a clear view shortly.

Chuck

I received a call from Jerry Krouse (Tenaska's Controller) re. the June 30=20
financials sent to us on August 30 and the $402,253 working capital=20
settlement due the former owners under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. =

I told him that we were looking at several items and verifying our=20
understanding of the amounts due.  Three questions:  (1) are we still of the=
=20
opinion that we should hold off on the working capital settlement pending a=20
clear course of action on the Westinghouse matters and, if so, (2) where are=
=20
we on the Westinghouse matters and (3) what should we be telling Tenaska?
