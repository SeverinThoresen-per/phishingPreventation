 That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its=

Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with=20
Coral.

Hi Dan,

I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources,=20
L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The=20
assignment was never made in Global Contracts.

If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will=20
assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master=
=20
contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL.

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Thanks!
Susan
