It's worth going to this site just to "flip the switch" and see the redacted=

Ken Smith just called my attention to the following.  See this link for all=20
formerly censored language from the DWR contracts:

http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/contract_info.htm

Also, see the summary link.

Finally, below is an interesting article about the real cost of the contract=

Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's=20
$69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex."  =20
