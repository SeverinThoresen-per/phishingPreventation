Rick:
The internal design and testing of EES risk quantification and mitigation is=
=20
now in a stage complete enough to be rolled in.  The process is cooperative=20
in nature between URM (utility risk management), GA in Houston, and GA in th=
e=20
regions.  Harry, Stella, Pat, and I shall start communicating this process t=
o=20
the colleagues, each in his/her regions shortly.   =20

Please let me know if you have any comment and/or advise.  Furthermore,=20
please advise if you want me to walk through the process with you to=20
demonstrate its abilities and output.

Best regards

Here it is guys including the new text in blue.=20

Stella Chan and Pat Keene are currently streamlining the process of providin=
g=20
Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management) to includ=
e:
Curve validation Process,=20
Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change,=20
Coordination of Strategy Development, and=20
Coordination of Strategy Implementation. =20
A description of these functions are as follows:
Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating,=20
every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's=
=20
books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review=20
period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA=20
personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved. =20
Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at quantifying=
=20
dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a=20
specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in progress.  Thi=
s=20
process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by=20
URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions.  The=20
quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA.  =20
Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and=20
quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely=20
call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of=20
Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in=20
association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in=20
Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahom=
a=20
Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action=20
items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for=20
implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off=
,=20
and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if=20
necessary.
Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it=20
shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to=20
coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the=20
regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the=
=20
implementation as needed.  =20

To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage line=
s=20
of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall=20
coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional=
=20
wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:
 Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC,=20
SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL.=20
 Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).


=46rom the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by t=
he=20
Regional Managers (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry=20
shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to be=
=20
as autonomous as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the=20
time and work load of the regional managers (usually in the final sprint for=
=20
approvals). =20

Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the=
=20
processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise.=20
