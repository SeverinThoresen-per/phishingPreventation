I am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas =
compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of=
 hand at a utility.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading c=
redentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am uncl=
ear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who th=
ey are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin
