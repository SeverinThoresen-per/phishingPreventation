	I am concerned we will have/or should have some of the frank discussions we=
 have
	with AA setting in the room.  Is there anyway we could have a rooster every=
one signs
	to show we attended if that is all they are concerned about?  Just a though=
t.  I can
	live with either decision, but I want to prep my people before the meeting =
if AA
	attends.  Thanks. Lynn

In the past, we have been somewhat hesitant to provide you with total "open =
access" to our monthly customer accounts meeting due to the frankness of our=
 discussions related to ongoing issues related to outstanding accounts recei=
vables, imbalances and potential financial exposure items.  I can appreciate=
 your desire to understand management's role in reviewing and monitoring the=
 controls that this meeting and the detailed status reports provide and woul=
d like to help you gain confidence in our process.=20

You mentioned that you would be "observing the process and not the content".=
  I would like to discuss this in more detail with you due to the sensitivit=
y of the customer information being discussed.

I will talk this over with Shelley.  Our next meeting is August 30th so I wi=
ll get back with you soon.

Rick,

Several of the monitoring reports that we use as a part of our internal
controls testing (i.e., A/R status report prepared by Alice, material PPAs,
etc.) are reviewed by management at the monthly customer accounts meeting.
Testing management's review of these reports is a key monitoring control
that we are attempting to obtain evidence of.  Due to the fact that there
is not a formal "sign-off" on these reports by Shelley, yourself, etc., we
need to obtain another form of evidence that they are being reviewed.  One
way to do this is for one of our people to sit in on a couple of the
meetings and observe the process.  Additionally, we would also need the
reports themselves in the form of copies of the packet used during the
meeting (I think Alice was going to talk to you about this).

Being able to observe these meetings would allow us to get comfortable that
the specific reports are being reviewed by management, and would alleviate
any need to perform detailed substantive testing on the reports themselves.
That testing could be fairly labor-intensive on both sides.

Realizing there may be a confidentiality/sensitivity issue related to the
content of the meeting, I want to ensure you that we would only be there to
observe the process and not analyze the content.

Please let me or Heather know your thoughts on this and whether or not
someone from our group would be able to attend the next meeting to be held
and probably one more after that.  Thanks Rick.

Tony
