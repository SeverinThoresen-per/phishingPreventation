Craig,

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use the ENA form of A=
ssignment.  Reason being -- the last B of A deal (when using their document)=
, which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.

Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA. =20
However, before we can finalize -- Credit must approve.

Jay,

Please advise if assignment of PCS deals are OK with Credit.=20

Susan=20

PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of=
 America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between =
Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade wou=
ld lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PC=
S today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this as=

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.
