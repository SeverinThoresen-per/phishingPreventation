Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, n=
o start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate driv=
e data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate applicati=
on during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
