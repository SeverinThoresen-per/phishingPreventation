The House Ways and Means Committee will consider the tax portions of the=20
"energy" bill after the July 4 recess.  We have learned that the Democrats o=
n=20
the Committee may offer a windfall profits tax on energy to pay for other=20
aspects of the tax bill.  The price of the tax bill has grown from the=20
Administration's anticipated level of $10 billion to over $50 billion and=20
under the pay-go rules additional tax cuts must be paid for from other=20
sources.  A similar amendment by Senator Rockefeller (D-WV) was overwhelming=
=20
rejected by the Senate Finance Committee.  We do not want to take anything=20
for granted as this could be continuously raised during the energy debate.

Per my request, Mike Pate is going to hold a meeting next week with EPSA,=20
API, EEI and other related associations to decide how to combat this and=20
future efforts on the windfall profits tax.  He will also invite company=20
representatives from El Paso, Duke, Williams and others.  However, we think=20
this effort is best pursued by our associations to avoid unwanted attention=20
to earnings.

I will update as this develops.
