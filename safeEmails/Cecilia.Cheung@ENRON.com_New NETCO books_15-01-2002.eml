Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian=
 book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (oth=
erwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last=
 time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot o=
f FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup. =
=20

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 1=
66859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasda=
ily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another b=
ook code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the orig=
inal list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to b=
e set up in Tagg/Erms.

Thanks,
Cecilia
