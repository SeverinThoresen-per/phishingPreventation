I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm=20
not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my=
=20
behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two=20
weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would=20
forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  jus=
t=20
keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.


Dana
