Just spoke to one of their traders.  Their credit is (as are all of our coun=
terparties) conducting a credit review.  As of this morning, they are not pu=
tting on any trading restrictions with us.  They have discussed implementing=
 a netting agreement, but we have responded that we will not, especially wit=
hout updating the current enabling agreement with a EEI (which they are oppo=
sed to).

Keep you posted.
