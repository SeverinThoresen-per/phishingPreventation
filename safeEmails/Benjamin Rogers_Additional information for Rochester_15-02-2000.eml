This is an e-mail from Rochester to Oscar discussing the transaction. Though=

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon. =20
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will g=
o=20
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution=20
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage=20
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas=20
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and=20
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month=
=20
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is=20
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM=20
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a=20
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My=20
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use th=
e=20
routine 2 page proposal format.
