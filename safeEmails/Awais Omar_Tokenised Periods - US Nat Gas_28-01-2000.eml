Jonathan,  in the email below are examples of the US Natural Gas Long=20
Descriptions we have come up with for the Tokenised Periods "Day Ahead" and=20
"Balance of Month".  The Short Description for these products will have the=20
specific dates in it whilst the long description will not.

Thus we need toi have language that will adequately describe the tokenised=20
period.

I am not familiar with the rules and specific calendar holidays that needs t=
o=20
be referenced in the relevant part of the long description.

Can you use the US ones we have done below as a start point come up with=20
language to describe the:
Day Ahead
Balance of Month
periods for Canadian Gas that will cover the weekend and holiday periods.

Mark, are you the appropriate legal counsel to review the tokenised=20
descriptions for Canadian Gas?


Thanks


Awais
