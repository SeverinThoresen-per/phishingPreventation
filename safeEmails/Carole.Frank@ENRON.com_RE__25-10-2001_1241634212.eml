Thanks.  That Kennedy Oil deal still needs to be in Sitara b/c it is causing=
 an imbalance in my positions.  If the deal is in Tagg, it needs to be in Si=
tara. Does that make sense?  Let me know.

No don't worry about shoving work off on us.  And we will work through the K=
ennedy Oil deal later.  It doesn't start until Dec.

O.k.  Not trying to shove off work on you guys!  Also, there was that Kenned=
y Oil (Glenrock) deal done last week.  We still do not have a Sitara # for t=
hat deal. Any news on that?
