Michelle,

Has the ER Marketing Campaign Roll-out been discussed with the HR heads?  If=
 not, I think this should be an agenda item at David Oxleys next HR heads' m=
eeting.  I met yesterday with Gary Smith and he expressed some concerns abou=
t ER marketing its services; he's concerned that it may encourage employees =
who have in the past handled their concerns internally or by working with th=
eir HR Reps to come out of the woodwork and swamp our resources.  I explaine=
d to him that we are not trying to drum up more business but rather ensure t=
hat employees are aware of mechanisms in place to address workplace issues.

Valeria
