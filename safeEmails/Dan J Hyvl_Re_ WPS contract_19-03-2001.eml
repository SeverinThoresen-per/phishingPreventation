Kim,
 I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of=20
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we=
=20
need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version=
=20
that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this year=
s=20
volume and price.  What is your preference?
