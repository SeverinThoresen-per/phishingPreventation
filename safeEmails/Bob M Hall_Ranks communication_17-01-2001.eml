After getting your imput, I think this is the best:

We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be=20
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need=
=20
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to=20
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a=20
bonus (may need to finda another role within or outside Enron which is a=20
better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be=20
different.  Glad they are here: believe that as they learn the organization=20
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution: doing=
=20
the right thing to learn business, but that contributions to date are not=20
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus.

Let me know what you think.

thanks

bob
