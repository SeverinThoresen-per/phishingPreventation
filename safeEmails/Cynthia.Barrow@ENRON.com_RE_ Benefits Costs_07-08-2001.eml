You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right no=
w.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing p=
rojects I will call them directly.   =20

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I d=
o know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this com=
pany.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group=
 it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  =
Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can loo=
k into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a f=
avor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll t=
ry to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the=
 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that=
 we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, =
the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited f=
inancials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnot=
e=20
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with =
these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for =
1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the =
actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution alloc=
ation.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000=
=2E  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do =
here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this wil=
l likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not h=
ave available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best cour=
se of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for ben=
efit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for=
 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation t=
hat I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was m=
erely that=20
	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try conta=
cting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a resp=
onse from=20
	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me believ=
ing that I would hear more from you, which I did not.  Lastly, I did mention=
 that if
	necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information =
but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and le=
ss=20
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not=
 the preferred method of providing this information. =20

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Account=
ing is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Anders=
en
	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requiremen=
ts.

Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby.  Just so =
you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight with=
out a day off and with an average of 14 hour days! =20

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If you=
 need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you ab=
out last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no way=
 I can look at this until later this week.

	Cindy,

	Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete au=
dited financials that are required to complete Project Timber (the sale
	of the MTBE assets to EOTT).  The following requests have not been acknowle=
dged and remain unanswered.  Please let me know who I should contact
	for this information.=20

	Arthur Andersen has since also requested this information for the 6 months =
ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001.  Any guidance you can provide is
	greatly appreciated.

	Thanks,
