Borderline
An Update from Northern Border Pipeline's
Customer Services and Gas Control Departments

No: 2001-21                                                    Date: October

Web Site Change

On Monday, October 29, the look and feel of Northern Border Pipeline's infor=
mational
posting site will officially change.  In addition, the URL tied to the site
will be slightly modified.

The new main URL will be www.nbpl.enron.com (nbpl versus nbp).  We recognize
that it may take a bit of time for this subtle abbreviation change to sink
in.  Consequently, our server has been set up to redirect anyone using the
previous informational posting web address to the new site.  But for those
more detailed URL addresses that have been set up in a browser or portal
site to link directly to information posted in the old site, this changeover
will not be as friendly; be aware that those specific addresses will be reti=
red
along with the old site.

As for the new web site layout, it has been purposely built under a "simpler
is better" philosophy.   It will not win any artistic design awards.   But
for the purpose of providing information, we believe that functionality of
an informational posting web site should always overrule show.  We hope that
you will agree.

It also should be noted that the new site design is not totally new and unte=
sted;
it closely parallels the solution we implemented earlier this year for Midwe=
stern
Gas Transmission, our sister pipeline company.   So those who have accessed
information recently on MGT should be familiar with the layout.

As always, we are open to suggestions.  Please let us know what you think.
