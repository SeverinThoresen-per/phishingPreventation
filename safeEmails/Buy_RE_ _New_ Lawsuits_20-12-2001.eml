Paul Flack asked me to ask each of you if you have received any materials re=
lating to lawsuits about which you have not yet informed us.  Paul's questio=
n arises from our learning about a motion that was filed in federal court in=
 Texarkana in a case styled Davis, et al. v. Enron, et al., in which you wer=
e named as defendants, and about which we have received no prior notice.

Thank you for your assistance.
