Forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades, and most=20

when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years, can only=
=20
mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and=20
fire in a world run increasingly by the job-discrimination bar.=20
Ask any non-deluded European. What makes the U.S. economy relatively nimble=20
is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they=20

lush job market compared to the employment Saharas of the Old World.=20
Yet firing in America has been a work in progress. Half a decade ago,=20
enlightened companies tried employee buyouts, but the lawyers descended,=20
forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately. Result: Highly=20
marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs, while=

downsized the old-fashioned way. But this was no proof against lawsuits.=20
Remember Texaco, Coca-Cola and others where the very existence of=20
affirmative-action programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities=20
and older white employees?=20
Searching for a way out of the legal maze, Ford tried two years ago to=20
combine forced ranking with buyouts, aiming offers exclusively at low-ranked=
=20
employees. Result: grumbling in the hallways of "rewarding failure" and good=
=20
employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden=20
parachute. Finally, starting this year, Ford opted for an out-and-out forced=

a "C" grade that meant either shape up or you're gone next year.=20

But Ford was already in the soup over the Explorer/Firestone fiasco. It=20
didn't stand a chance when the Detroit papers opened a new front over its=20

Mr. Ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the company's conscience becaus=
e=20
of blood chemistry or something. Inevitably, he wants to be liked and wants=20

worst thing the company could have done at a time when Mr. Nasser was clearl=
y=20
set on giving the place a kick in the pants.=20
In the ranking controversy, Mr. Ford soon was reported to be "concerned abou=
t=20
the system's impact on morale." Notice how this differs from "the system is=20
an urgent necessity so Ford can become a better company." With this kind of=20
support, management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the old-folk=

One of the ironies, as Ford shows, is that companies these days have reasons=

i.e., employers are free to hire and fire at will -- there would be a lot=20

GE may not exactly be the rainbow coalition, but it does have a lesson for=20
Ford. Under its version of forced rankings, 10% of managers are assigned to =

A big difference, though, is that the process is not concentrated in a=20

RUSSIA: INTERVIEW-Russian Tyumen Oil says foreign ties to grow.
By Sujata Rao

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Reuters) - Russia's Tyumen Oil Company said on Wednesday it=
=20
planned huge expansion of its upstream and downstream profile through=20
ventures with foreign oil majors. Company President Simon Kukes told Reuters=
=20
in an interview that Tyumen - Russia's fourth-largest oil producer with=20
output of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) - would also seek a New York Stock=20
Exchange listing in 2002 after market conditions improved.=20
"We aim to be a multi-national company and the first step is in Ukraine,=20
where we will within a year be the number one retailer of oil products," he=20
said.
Kukes said Tyumen was also interested in Eastern Europe and in talks on=20
projects that a included a stake in Lithuania's Mazeikiu refinery , but he=20
declined to elaborate.=20
"Eastern Europe has logistical advantages for Russian firms. We can bring in=
=20
oil easily and get a significant market share. I also see a role for us in=20
China, India and the Middle East." He said Tyumen, controlled by Russia's=20
Alfa conglomerate, saw foreign oil majors' involvement as a key to its=20
growth.=20
"We would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and, in=20
fact, we are now in talks with several foreign partners, including Texaco ,"=
=20
Kukes said.=20
He added earlier talks with Phillips had had no result.=20
Tyumen is involved in the $11 billion Kovykta project with BP and several=20

in a partnership expanding its 800-strong filling network by combining them=20
with the U.S. Star Mart brand.=20
Earlier this year the firms inked a deal to jointly produce lubricants at=20
Tyumen's LINOS refinery in Ukraine. Kukes said total investments in 2001 are=
=20
planned at $800 million, with another $1 billion earmarked for each of the=20
coming years.=20
Tyumen also got a boost by being rated the World's Best Oil Company in 2000=20
by Financial Times Energy for "phenomenal growth in the past year, breaking=20
into the world's top 15 oil firms."=20
"By year end, we could jump from fourth to third place among Russian oil=20
producers," said the U.S.-educated Kukes, who is part of Tyumen's efforts to=
=20
boost its profile internationally.=20
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED=20
Tyumen is now eyeing natural gas, angling to up its Kovykta stake and in=20
Rospan, with 600 billion cubic metres in reserves.=20
Kukes sees gas as part of a strategy to develop Tyumen on the lines of Enron=
=20
- producing crude, gas and power.=20
"Gas is an essential component of a vertically-integrated oil company and in=
=20
the way we see ourselves in future," Kukes said. "We aim that in five years,=
=20
10-15 percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate."=20
But aggressive expansion has brought Tyumen into conflict with competitors.=20
It has locked horns with arch-rival Interros to wrest control over a stake i=
n=20
Kovykta, and its role in oil firm Sidanco - where BP owns 10 percent - has=20
been criticised.=20
"We'd like to get at least 25 percent in Kovykta," Kukes said, noting Tyumen=
=20
was keen for BP, which has a 31 percent stake, to remain project leader.=20
Tyumen also angered influential gas trader Itera by trying to obtain control=
=20
over its bankrupt gas producer, Rospan.=20
"Rospan is a profitable firm but for some reason was losing money," Kukes=20
said, adding Tyumen would turn the company around.

Bush switch on conservation saves credibility

Too bad we can't all be vice president. If we could, this whole "energy=20
crisis" thing would be no big deal.=20
We could send our heating bill to the Navy as Dick Cheney has. Who knows,=20
maybe we could fuel up our cars and let the Energy Department pay the bill.
Cheney is making quite a shift from the advice he offered to consumers just =
a=20
few weeks ago. "If you want to leave all the lights on in your house, you=20
can," he counseled. "There's no law against it. But you will pay for it."=20
Or, in Cheney's case, the Navy may pay for it. After all, it owns his house.=
=20
The Vice President decided to dun the Navy on the very day administration=20
officials spread out to promote conservation as a key part of President=20
Bush's energy plan.=20
My, how the scene has changed. In mid-May President Bush unveiled a=20
Cheney-authored energy plan that promoted drilling and nuking and mining but=
=20
overlooked conserving. That's when the vice president dismissed conservation=
=20
as a "personal virtue" but no energy policy.=20
The 170-page Bush policy did speak ominously of a growing "energy crisis."=20
At the time, gasoline seemed headed to $3 a gallon. Rolling blackouts=20
interrupted California's power. Winter natural gas prices had spiked.=20
Bush seemed confident he could push his energy policy through a House and=20
Senate dominated by Republicans.=20
Today, with gasoline prices down around $1.35 a gallon and the Senate under=20
Democratic control, Bush will have to give up on pet dreams like drilling fo=
r=20
liquid gold in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.=20
Conservation is all the talk--even from administration officials who can't=20
talk.=20
A laryngitis-stricken Cheney on Monday turned to wife Lynne to declare,=20
"Conservation is a must."=20
On Monday, the Energy Department declared that federal agencies since 1980=20
have cut their energy consumption in buildings by 30 percent.=20
So the world has completely changed, right?=20
Conservation now will become a centerpiece of the Bush energy policy. The=20
caribou and moose and grizzlies in Alaska can sleep easy knowing their=20
pristine habitat will be forever free and clear.=20
Isn't it obvious that President Bush's supporters at Enron and Texaco and=20
other oil giants should get into a more promising line of business?=20
And maybe the alternative-energy researchers at Argonne National Laboratory=20
can stop studying super-conductivity and new-age fuel cells. Energy Secretar=
y=20
Spencer Abraham told them Monday that consumer conservation can cut the=20
energy deficit by 60 percent over the next 20 years.=20
Perhaps it's time to turn that big super-conducting super collider into the=20
world's largest Roller Derby track.=20
Well, maybe not.=20
The easing of the trumped up "energy crisis" is good news. And not just=20
because it won't cost nearly as much to drive to the Dells for summer=20
vacation.=20
It's good because it seems likely to bring some balance into whatever energy=
=20
policy ultimately emerges from Congress sometime later this year.=20
The Bush plan hasn't changed. There still are only a tiny $10 billion of=20
conservation measures--half of them already in place--in the gargantuan=20
energy program.=20
But the political and market realities have changed. Energy costs are down.=20
And conservation suddenly seems likely to get a fair hearing in Congress and=
=20
at the White House.=20
Perhaps most important, the free market has shown an ability to respond to a=
=20
so-called "crisis" in energy. This reduces the political pressure for a quic=
k=20
and ill-advised political fix.=20
A sudden jump in electric-plant construction means supply should grow twice=20
as fast as demand over the next several years, according to the North=20
American Electric Reliability Council. More than 1,000 natural gas wells are=

Duke Energy, the US energy company, yesterday posted a 27 per cent leap in=20
second quarter earnings, underpinned by strong growth at its North American=20
natural gas and electricity trading business.=20
Duke, a large utility owner in the US, said after the market closed that it=20

=20
in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues for the quarter increased 43 per cent to $15.6bn, from $10.9bn a=20

e=20
by more than $6bn since last May - allegations the companies have denied.=20
Last night, a Duke Energy spokesman said that California remained a small=20

He said the result was driven by strong growth in its North American energy=20
trading segment, which reported earnings before interest and tax of $251m, a=
=20
128 per cent increase on the year-ago quarter.=20
The unit's growth was fuelled by big expansion in its wholesale energy asset=

operation or under construction, compared with about 8,400MW net a year ago.=
