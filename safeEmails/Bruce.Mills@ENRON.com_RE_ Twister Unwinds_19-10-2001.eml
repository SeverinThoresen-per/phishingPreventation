 Hi Bruce/Edward -=20

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or =
zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals=
 in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals t=
hat payment references? =20

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this paym=
ent is for the termination of these deals. =20

Thanks,
Diane

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69=
,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We =
partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru =
Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated =
on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a pr=
ior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call i=
f you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.
