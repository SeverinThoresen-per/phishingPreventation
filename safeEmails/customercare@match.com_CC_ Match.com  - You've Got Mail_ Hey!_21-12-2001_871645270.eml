Hello Again,

I do ski and sometimes even snowboard.  I haven't been up very much this yea=
r but I think things are about to change.  What about you, are you an extrem=
e skier?

I'll be going to San Antonio (TX) for the holidays.  My folks have a small r=
anch outside Kerrville in what they call the "Hill Country."  It's actually =
pretty nice.  I hope the weather is good.  South Texas isn't all that bad in=
 the winter....it's the summer that's hell!  What do you have planned for th=
e holidays?  Where are you from?

I'm taking off for the airport.  Drop me a line and tell me how you're doing=
=2E  Have a GREAT holiday and let's talk soon.

Paul
