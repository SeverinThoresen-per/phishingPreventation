I have the final audit report from AA.  It was delivered with the=20
reconciliation that we requested AA to perform.

If you remember, AA finished their study about the time of the final=20

the audit was findings were put on hold.

I agree with Ed about AA being caught in the middle.  They were really=20

=20
last year of service ending April, I would like to
go ahead and notify Reliant/Entex and find another firm to perform the audit=
=2E=20

Let me know the next steps if any.

Thanks

bob

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets=20

theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreement.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and=20
industrial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in=

price between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly=20

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their=20

Team:

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and=20
obligations (implied, documented or otherwise) between Entex, ENA and HPL. =20
We need to pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1. The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves=20
against those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2. The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the=20
definitive results of the audit.

Brad/Jim:  can you email the note you gave me today to the above group.

Tom/Ed:  can you pull together a summary of the results of the audit showing=
=20
what Entex owes HPL and what Entex owes ENA.

Lillian: can you arrange a meeting with the above group to discuss.

Thanks,
Brian
