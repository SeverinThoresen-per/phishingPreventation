GREAT JOB TO ALL!!   We made it from contract execution to financial close i=
n 5 months.  This success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of y=
ou and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction, including:

1.	Setting an industry record for responding to a 2nd request from the Dept.=
 of Justice and securing their approval.
2.	Expediting the analysis and repair of a 60 mile segment of the A/S pipeli=
ne.=20
3.	Transitioning HPL's hardware and software infrastructure from Enron to AE=
P
4.	Unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value o=
f over $150MM
5.	Separating HPL's business process, work flow, from Enron (after 75 years =
of integrated operation)
6.	Segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
7.	Collecting and sorting over 14,000 boxes of books and records
8.	Moving over 250 people from 4 different Enron entities into a new locatio=
n while keeping the pipeline operating.
7.	Accounting for the transfer of PRM assets, CWIP, leased assets, purchased=
 assets, imbalances, payables and receivables.=09

The transaction freed up approximately $725MM of capital that Enron can put =
to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses, but the work=
 on HPL is not over yet.  There are a number of follow up activities that we=
 need to complete in order to maximize the value of the HPL transaction.  Ji=
m Coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis, including:

1.	Collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with AEP to resolv=
e imbalances.
2.	Closing out accounting entries for property, work orders, external accoun=
ts payable, and internal charges.
3.	Eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilitie=
s.
4.	Fully transitioning HPL systems, facilities, and books/records to AEP.

Again, thank you for your effort - and if I have inadvertently missed anyone=
 please pass along my appreciation to them as well.  We will be hosting a lu=
nch for the Enron/HPL employees who worked on the transaction on the 15th of=
 June at 12:00 in the Imperial Ballroom at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Please =
attend if your schedule permits.

Regards,
Brian
