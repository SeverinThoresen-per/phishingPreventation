Subject:	RE: TMS Outage post Production Migration


Beginning Wednesday, after the production migration, a problem was discovere=
d with the IDD/PNR Contract Balance view on the storage menu.  The view was =
not displaying all information; it appeared many of the total balance fields=
 were missing and zeros were displayed where numbers should have been.  Afte=
r looking into the issue, we discovered that the data was never making it fr=
om the database.  This led us to believe there was a driver incompatibility =
issue.

We began working with Microsoft to find the cause of the problem.  Meanwhile=
, we removed our ODBC changes for this particular image and went back to usi=
ng native driver connections.  This solved the problem with the view so it w=
as decided to move this change to production.  We are still working with Mic=
rosoft to find the exact cause of the problem.

A fix was developed yesterday and moved into production last night.  The vie=
w should be fixed today.  I have tested it and am happy with the results.

We are satisfied with the solution of switching this process back to native =
driver connections.  I can give a more detailed explanation if you like, jus=
t let me know.

Jennifer
