Beth,

As Greg Asaf has mentioned to you, we believe that there are some weather po=
sitions that require prompt attention. I am especially concerned that we get=
 moving on the curve validation and position understanding prior to the grou=
p leaving on February 28th. The following is a list of those positions:=20

Goldman Sachs Puts
These trades have all been terminated as of December 4, 2001. We believe tha=
t there is between $31 million and $36 million of value to Enron in these tr=
ansactions.  These are extremely large relative to the market and will requi=
re special attention to negotiate out of.=20

ABN/AMRO (London) Calls
This short call position is part of the largest transaction ever executed in=
 the weather market.  Accordingly, this is also a potentially difficult nego=
tiation. In discussions with ABN/AMRO they have expressed a willingness to l=
et us out of these flat and are sending me a letter to that effect.

Cargill (Europe) Portfolio
We are out of the money to Cargill about $300K, but to avoid the hassle of m=
anaging the positions Cargill would just like to let us out flat.  They have=
 been trying to reach someone to help them.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District ("SMUD") and related put options
The precipitation put options hedging this transaction are held by Enron Re =
which is going into voluntary liquidation.  The contracts with the insurance=
 companies require that we maintain a weather station at the site.  The grou=
p responsible for managing the sites no longer exists.

AIG Put Options
This curve needs to be validated and our value independently confirmed. Agai=
n, there are unique attributes to this transaction that should be worked out=
 while we are still here.

Enron Re
In addition to the puts held by Enron Re, we have a $4 million receivable wi=
th Enron Re.

Mark.
