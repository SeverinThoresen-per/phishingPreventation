Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:

1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent=
=20
level?

2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings" financials.

3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the=20
only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to=20
covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that=20
it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have an=
y=20
thoughts on this?
