Pete,

This "bug" initiates as we roll into the new day, as for the exact time...we=
=20
will have to watch closely and get back to you on that.  The bug  or false=20
finals are an exact duplicate of the previous days finals for that schedule.=
 =20
If the current day has a null value for HE 24, no new final will overwrite=20
the bug or false final.  Consequently we are left with false finals that hav=
e=20
absolutely no relation to anything that occurred on the current day.  Going=20
forward, we will do our best to document the occurence of these false=20
finals. =20
This bug is annoying and time consuming, but if recognized it seems that our=
=20
best course of action is to run the report, identify the false finals as the=
=20
variance, and then give you a call to manually change the values in CAPS so=20
that it will archive properly.  Any more feedback you have concerning this=20
bug would be appreciated.

Thank you for your help.

Bill
