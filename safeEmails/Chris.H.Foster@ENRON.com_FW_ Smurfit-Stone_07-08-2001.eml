Will advise as to any netting benefits we may get regarding gas/power deals =
with Smurfit.  For now, the gas team does not want to take on any incrementa=
l risk with Smurfit from the physical gas perspective.

We can still look at case-by-case physical power deals with EPMI given the c=
ollateral that we're holding.

Tracy,
	Talked to Tanya regarding the long deal for SSCC and relayed to her your su=
ggestion for handling gas.  She is ok with managing both gas and power throu=
gh EPMI as long as legal is on board and all necessary EPMI docs are in plac=
e or amended (netting, physical gas), and that we are comfortable with the r=
eceivables risk to SSCC.  She actually mentioned that there has been discuss=
ions about merging EPMI and ENA into one entity to more properly handle net =
positions, so she seems to like your idea. =20
	With that, I guess I'll pass this deal and legal relationship onto you unle=
ss you need or want me to help with any of this. =20

Thanks,
Max
