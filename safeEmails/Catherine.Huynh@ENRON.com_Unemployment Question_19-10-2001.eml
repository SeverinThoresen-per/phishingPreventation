Hi Michelle,

The presentation went as well as it could.  There was quite a bit of stunned=
 silence, but the questions are already starting to trickle in.

One particular question on unemployment insurance I'm not familiar with, hop=
ing you or Drew can help.

Since the VSP is effectively a voluntary election, would employees qualify f=
or unemployment insurance, specifically in New York State.

Under the involuntary program, is the severance payment offset by unemployme=
nt compensation?

You can see where this question is leading, some people may be hedging their=
 bets on the time value of the money.

Thanks
Cathy
