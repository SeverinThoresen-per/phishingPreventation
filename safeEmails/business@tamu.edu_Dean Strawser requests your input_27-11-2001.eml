Let me introduce myself as the new dean of Texas A&M's Lowry Mays=20
College & Graduate School of Business. As dean of the Mays College=20
and a member of the class of '83, I am honored to be associated with=20
our school and look forward to working with you to further its=20
development.

One of my first and foremost initiatives is engaging our stakeholders=20
in an intensive branding and imaging campaign to appropriately=20
communicate what it means to be a graduate of the Mays College and of=20
Texas A&M University. To do so, I have asked a well-known marketing=20
and branding consultant and former student, Mr. Brandon Coleman '78,=20
to assist me in this effort.

Thus far, we have met with current students, faculty, staff,=20
corporate recruiters, and our college's advisory boards to get their=20
thoughts. Now, it is time to reach out to you as a graduate of this=20
college and ask for your valuable opinions.

You have undoubtedly reflected upon your Texas A&M University=20
experience and have personally seen the value of your business=20
degree. Please share your reflections with us.
  - What does being a business graduate from Texas A&M mean to you?
  - What should it mean?
  - How are we at the Mays College different?
  - How has your business degree helped you in your life?

While these may seem to be simple questions, your answers will help=20
us communicate more effectively to others the uniqueness of the=20
educational experience of the Mays College at Texas A&M.

To respond to these questions, visit=20
http://maysbusiness.tamu.edu/se/input.htm . Your answers are=20
anonymous unless you choose to give us your name and contact=20
information, but doing so isn't required.  You have through December=20
3 to give us your input  through this Web page.

I thank you in advance for taking the time to give me your feedback,=20
and ask your understanding of the somewhat impersonal nature of an=20
e-mail approach.

Please accept my most sincere wishes for every future success. If we=20
at the Mays College can ever be of assistance to you, do not hesitate=20
to contact us at maysbusiness@tamu.edu.

Regards, Jerry

Jerry R. Strawser '83, Dean
Mays College & Graduate School of Business
Texas A&M University
