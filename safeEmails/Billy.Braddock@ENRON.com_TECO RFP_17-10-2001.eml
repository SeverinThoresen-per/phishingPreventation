Kevin,

As we discussed, TECO is offering up to 500MW (of a total 960MW) beginning 5=
/1/04 off the Gannon facility (which is being converted from coal to a gas-f=
ired CC plant, called Bayside).  The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering =
is unit-contingent. =20

TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other pro=
posals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we b=
ring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas s=
upply, 3) fixed price call. =20

I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficie=
ncy's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized=
, gas supply risk, etc.).

What is your preferred structure?  How many MW would you like to show a bid =
for?  Structuring ran an initial valuation for a 3-year, $35 daily call, 100=
MW.  Results are below.
