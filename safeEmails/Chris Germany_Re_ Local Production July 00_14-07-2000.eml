Subject: Re: Local Production July 00


Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this loc=
al
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can=20
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to gi=
ve
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identificatio=
n
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the loca=
l
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will nee=

Thanks,
