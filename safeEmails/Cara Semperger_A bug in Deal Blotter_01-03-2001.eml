Good Morning,

When a transmission deal is entered in blotter, for some reason the volume=20
also gets put in to the loss column as well, showing us with the full volume=
=20
on one end of the deal, and zero volume on the other.

This happened with two deals today,  deal 535344 and 535343 put into blotter=
=20
by Crandall.  Once the problem was identified, I went into the deal and=20
changed the loss volume to zero.

C
