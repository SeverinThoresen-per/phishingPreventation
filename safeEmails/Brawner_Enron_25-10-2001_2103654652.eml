	As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not b=
egin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of Enron sin=
ce June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions a=
nd or ask direct questions.=20
	I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catast=
rophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM=
 !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market =
place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan =
of action, attack it, and save this company.
