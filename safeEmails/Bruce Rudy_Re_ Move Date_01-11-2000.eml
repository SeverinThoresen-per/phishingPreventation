Hey Bruce,

I have not received final word from the movers yet.  But they have told me
it will be between the 15th and 18th.  They have committed to delivering
our stuff on the 20th or the 21st.  Hope this helps.

Chris

Chris,

Hey, I just wanted to see if you had arrived at a firm date for when the
movers were going to come to do the pack and move.

Thanks,

Bruce
