Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:

1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent=
=20
level? Yes, and it will remain at the parent level=20

2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings" financials. Yes we=20
want AK Holdings financials, we also want a representation in the contract=20
that states that AK Holdings financials are the same as AK Steel's financial=
s=20
because it is the only wholly owned subsidiary of AK Holdings.=20

3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the=20
only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to=20
covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that=20
it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have an=
y=20
thoughts on this? Yes we want to say that if AK Steel is NOT the only wholly=
=20
owned sub, then it is an event of default.  It can be cured by a parent=20
guarantee or by providing independent financial statements for AK Steel.
