The outage will continue through the weekend for the 17.91 MW on the steam t=
urbine.  I filed an outage report with the ISO for this period although the =
ISO has not returned it.

Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBG=
N_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitte=
d an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UN=
ITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,
Stan
