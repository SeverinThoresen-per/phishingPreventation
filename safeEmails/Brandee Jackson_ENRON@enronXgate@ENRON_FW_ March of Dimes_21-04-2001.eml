Dear ENA Team Member:
=20
I am proud to serve as a sponsor of Enron's March of Dimes 2001 Walk Team.  =
 March of Dimes is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to imp=
rove the health of babies preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Ch=
ildhood health is a cause near and dear to my heart.  =20
=20
Obviously, it is a cause that is near and dear to Enron employees as well.  =
Last year our Enron team raised over $46,000.   This year our team has set a=
 goal to raise $75,000.  With your help, I believe we can achieve this aggre=
ssive goal.=20
=20
I understand that you are called upon to donate your time and money to many =
worthy causes and clearly I am not a seasoned fundraiser.  What I can tell y=
ou is that I am proud of our employees that have rallied a grassroots effort=
 to support March of Dimes here at Enron.  I am committed to continuing thei=
r work.  I ask that you consider making a donation in any amount. =20

Please use the attached envelope to make your donation to the March of Dimes=
 and forward you check back to me by Friday, April 27th.  Your contribution =
is totally tax deductible and Enron will match your gift dollar for dollar (=
I will take care of the matching paperwork). =20
=20
Thanks, in advance, for your donation and support of the March of Dimes.  Yo=
u can read more about the March of Dimes at www.modimes.org. =20
