In today's eSpeak session you made the following comments:=20
"To the best of my recollection, the only asset we sold in the second quarte=
r to a subsidiary company was our Clean Fuels business, which we sold to EOT=
T, and on that transaction there was virtually no profit."
In fact, EGM recognized $120 million in mark to market earnings from an offt=
ake agreement that was inextricably linked to the sale.  The recognition of =
these earnings would not have been possible without the sale. =20
My confidence in your integrity compells me to alert you of my concern with =
your statements from the eSpeak session.  I urge you to investigate the tran=
saction further.  After you have done so, I believe you will agree with me t=
hat your statements appear misleading to anyone with a better understanding =
of the deal.
Regards,
Brian Terp
