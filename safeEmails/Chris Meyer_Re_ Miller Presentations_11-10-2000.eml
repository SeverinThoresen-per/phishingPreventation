I've review all three.  We have definite problems with WIlton.  The other tw=
o=20
are correctable without Mike's assistance.  My comments are below:

Wilton:
- The OBA is a ten year agreement ending March 31, 2010 (not a two year=20
term).  You can probably delete=20
 the sentence where he addresses term.
- The transport rate on Northern Border is approximately 4 cents per 100=20
dekatherm mile (not 4 cents)
- The ANR IPLS Agreement expires in April of 2001 and then rolls month to=20
month thereafter.
 The discounted rate of 3 cents is only good through October of 2000, then=20
the rate reverts to
 maximum tariff rate (unless negotiated otherwise).

Wheatland
- Delete Mike's sentence where he talks about term.=20

Gleason
- The info I heard was fine; however, the beginning of his narrative is cut=20
off.

I'll be at the doctors office from 7:00 a.m. till about 10:00 a.m then in a=20
meeting from 10:00 to 11:00.  I'll try to catch you guys in between. =20
Otherwise try me on my cell 713-408-6240.
