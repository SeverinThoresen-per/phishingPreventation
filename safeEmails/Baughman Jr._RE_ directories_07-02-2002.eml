Dale,

I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See=
 my notes below:

M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info=20
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Studies=09

The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We wi=
ll not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your o=
rganization will need the information. =20

Please let me know if you need me to check others for you. =20

Thanks.=20

Debra	=09
