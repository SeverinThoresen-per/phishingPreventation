You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization t=
o support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.  We =
have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed ho=
w we will manage the Estate going forward.  What role do you envision that I=
 will play?  Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?

 I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and h=
ad independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back off=
ice for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activitie=
s) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources. =
  With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reo=
rganize the operations teams' efforts.  I will be glad to share that with yo=
u as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.  --S=
