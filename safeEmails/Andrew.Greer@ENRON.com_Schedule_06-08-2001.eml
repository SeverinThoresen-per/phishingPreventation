Don:

Per our phone conversation last night, according to the August schedule I'm =
scheduled to work the night of Fri 17th and Sat 18th.  As mentioned a few we=
eks ago I have signed up to attend a Sunday school retreat that weekend.  I'=
ve actually been ask to speak Fri night and would really like to do all I ca=
n to attend.  Currently we have 4 guys scheduled to work Sat night, so my ab=
sence shouldn't be a big deal, however, Friday's schedule just has me and Ma=
uricio (there's currently no ERCOT guy scheduled so if that changes, my prob=
lem is solved).  I attempted to work out a trade with a few guys with no suc=
cess.  Maybe even Brant Reves can be scheduled that night if no ERCOT is pen=
ciled in.  Anything we could work out would be GREATLY appreciated, even if =
I have to give up vacation time it's not a problem. =20

As for the GMAT and graduate school reimbursement we discussed, I was told t=
o contact my Business Unit Mgr for the necessary info.  As you know Enron mu=
st sponsor my application into UH's Executive MBA program so any guidance yo=
u can provide me with is appreciated. =20

One last thing.  I currently hold a NASD Series 7 & 63 licenses.  These lice=
nses need to be housed with Enron to prevent them from expireing.  Who would=
 I contact about housing them here?

Thanks for all you help Don.

Sincerely,
Andrew=20
