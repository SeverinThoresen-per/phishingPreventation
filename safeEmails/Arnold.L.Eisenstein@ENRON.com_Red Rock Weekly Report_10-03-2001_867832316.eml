1.	ACTIVITIES:

	a.	Completed site visit to all stations and evaluation of existing faciliti=
es

	b. Discussions with TW on critical items in order to finalize FERC applicat=
ion:

			Navajo Environmental has requested a Threatened & Endangered Species (T&E=
) and Archeological studies on stations 3 and 4.  Following completion of th=
e survey (next week) The reviewing agency has 30 days to make determination.=
  Regulatory has determined that the FERC submittal is to be delayed until r=
eceipt of determination.

			ECS is preparing a proposal for electric compression at Station 1 to be d=
elivered Tuesday 3/13.  This needs to be evaluated quickly if any interest e=
xists.  This proposal should have a $5 mm decrease to project capital with i=
ncreased operational flexibility.  FERC Project description will require ame=
ndment if interested.

			Turbine Compressor selection evaluation is underway with proposals receiv=
ed from Rolls Royce and GE/NP.  Project Team and GSS will complete recommend=
ation by 3/16/01

			Project Environmental	 has scheduled meetings with Air Permit agencies an=
d expect no issues.  Permit is expected in a 5 - 7 month time frame.

			Existing Noise Survey results have been received.  Recommendations for ne=
w facilities is being revised to accurately reflect Nearest Sensitive Recept=
or's (NSR) at individual stations.

			Plot Plans and Scope of Work are being revised based on site visit. =20


c.		Change Requests and justifications are being prepared for review by mark=
eting for items not in original Scope of Work.

			Station Scrubbers were originally estimated to be revised in place for in=
creased flow and efficiency.  The current scrubbers cannot be modified and w=
ill be evaluated for flow increase.  Based on projected increases in flow (f=
uture planned expansion), a scrubber upgrade now would alliaviate higher pre=
ssure drops and additions to scrubbers later.  It is recommended that a new =
high efficiency scrubber be considered for immediate installation based on i=
ncreased efficiency and arrest of liquid migration due to increased flows.  =
Installation under separate workorder would allow tie-ins to the pipeline to=
 be made at our conviencence without large effect on pipeline thruput for 3 =
days.  Resultant Station tie-in would result in a 2 day outage of the statio=
n vs 5 days currently scheduled.  Estimated cost is $1 MM

			Electrical Generation was evaluated for capacity and reliability. Units a=
t station are 40 years old and in need of renewal prior to increased loading=
 due to gas cooler addition for new station.  Stations 1,2, and 4 will requi=
re augmentation to current electrical service.  Station 3 recent load test d=
oes not meet project reguirements.  Simplify tie-in to utilities and demarka=
tion of old/new station facilities could be accomplished  by utilizing corre=
ctly sized new units.  This would become the weak link in reliable project o=
perations should this not be approved.  Estimated cost is $1 MM.

			Station recycle valves were requested by planning and Gas control to be a=
dded to the Scope of Work to increase flexibility.  Turbines have limited tu=
rndown.  The spare horsepower based on turbine selection limits turndown fur=
ther.  Estimated cost is $1 MM.

2.	OBJECTIVES FOR NEXT WEEK:

a.	await TW Marketing evaluation of electrical compression option for statio=
n 1

b.	Pre Award meeting with T/C vendor scheduled for bid and delivery clarific=
ation. =20

c.	Recommend Turbine/Compressor vendor.

d.	Submit Change Requests to Marketing for approval

e.	Complete Engineering Scope of Work and solicit bids


3.	OLD ISSUES:

	none

4.	Areas of Concern:

Station Overhead rates were originally evaluated as 11% in the original esti=
mates.  Sebsequent evaluations by TW (Jim Saunders) changed the rate to 2%. =
 Additional correspondence indicates a 2 to 4% overhead rate is adequate.=20

Change Requests are being evaluated by the project team to make the "best ov=
erall" decision for the project and future operations.  Capital dollars are =
offset by tie-in downtime and simplicity.

Details of future expansion plans are required to evaluate impact to existin=
g facilities and equipment selections.=20
