Per our discussion, here is where we are on the Devon / Midcon (now Oneok)=20
Quinduno well  issue:

For the Devon purchase, we have been showing a price of the NGPL-Midcontinen=
t=20
index + $.01 less $.3276 gathering--the 8.5% fuel was never shown in Sitara=20
and has never been deducted from Devon's purchase price as it should have=20
been.  This purchase falls under the "big" Devon deal that came to us from=20
CES--it is my understanding that this contract ends in July of this year.
 Mary Ellenberger handles Devon and should take care of the 8.5% fuel issue=20
retroactively to January 2000.

For the Midcon Texas (now Oneok) sale, we have been showing in Sitara the=20
NGPL-Midcontinent index less 8.5% fuel--the $.3276 gathering fee has never=20
showed up in Sitara as a deduction from the sales price as it should have=20
been.  Also, Oneok has never paid ENA for this gas all the way back to=20
January 2000 due to the fact that there was no contract.
 George Smith is taking care of the Midcon (now Oneok) issue.  For March=20
forward, Oneok has made it clear to George that they want to negotiate a=20
price with us for this production.  They have agreed to take all production=20
between 1/00 and 2/01 at NGPL Index flat less $.3276 gathering , less 8.5%=20
fuel.

When this is all cleaned up, the difference between the 8.5% fuel charge we=20
will receive from Devon vs. the $.3276 gathering fee we will not collect fro=
m=20
Midcon Texas is the adjustment that should hit your desk.  I do not have all=
=20
the actual volumes but, when I just use the volumes in Sitara under the=20
Midcon tickets, and do the fuel calculations for Devon vs the gathering fee=20
we did not account for, the impact was less than $20,000 (positive). =20
Therefore, even after actuals are used, I don't expect the amount to be=20
significant one way or the other

If you have any questions, please advise.

The price that Oneok Field Services will be paying is a standard wellhead=20
netback price. Mainline index minus any associated fees required to get the=20
gas to the mainline. In this case that is $.3276 in gathering charges and 8=20
1/2% fuel. The original sale ticket was 91 1/2% of NGPL midcontinent index,=20
to reflect the fuel loss. The Devon purchase ticket reflects a deduction of=20
$.3276 reflecting the gathering charge. Neither ticket seems to capture all=20
of the appropriate fees.

The only way that ENA remains whole is if Devon is billed the appropraite=20
fuel charge.=20

The volumes that Devon provides to us each month do not reflect any fuel=20
deductions. =20
