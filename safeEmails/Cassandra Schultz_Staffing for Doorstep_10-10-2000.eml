Since we couldn't get us all together on the phone (Sally, you're out of the=
=20
office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all bee=
n=20
having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see severa=
l=20
alternatives:

Our Needs:
1) Database Management
2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report

No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep=20
database. =20

Our Goals:
The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in=20
fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of=20
being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Ris=
k=20
Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his=
=20
understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should=20
select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.

If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most=20
efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the=
=20
way to get there.

Alternatives:
1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them=20
in planning, interviews, etc.=20
  - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are=20
experienced managers/directors who would only
  be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business;=
=20
it is also a management problem for his staff to be
  under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement

  Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them=20
documenting the findings in the report
   - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?
  =20
  Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of "brains" - we just need brawn
   -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to=20
target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.
   - planning and oversight with 3 groups "in charge" is inefficient and=20
could cause accountability question

2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead,=20
consider one of the following:
 A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test an=
d=20
write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to
  do the deal test
  =20
  Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who ca=
n=20
benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no
   issue with managing staff, etc.;=20

  Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote?=
=20

 B) Outsource to AA

  Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house=20
expertise, expensive,=20


 C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk=20
Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or=20
accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.


Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep=20
to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends o=
n=20
what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome=20
the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can w=
e=20
afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group=20
with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface=
,=20
we can do that instead.

Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans. =20

Regards,
Cassandra.
