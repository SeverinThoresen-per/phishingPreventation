Yes, May has been received.  I've tied out the fuel retained, used(slightly =
off,but that's probably ppa's), linepack sales, & electric fuel.
I'm trying to tie out imbalances.  They are off.  Ken, is putting a B.O. sch=
edule together by contract so I can tie back to the CBS summary report.  Onc=
e that's done, it good to go.

I have added the Linepack change to the report, as we discussed in our last =
meeting. This information is in the last column, column "U", on the report. =
The cell calculates the change in linepack from the previous day. Linepack r=
eadings are taken at the end of each gas day.

Please call me if you have any questions.
