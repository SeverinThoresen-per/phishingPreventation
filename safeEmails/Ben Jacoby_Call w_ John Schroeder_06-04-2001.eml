Chris / Kay:

I talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said w=
e=20
were close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit,=20
with the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him no=
t=20
to disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very=20
positive on this.

I also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock=20
stopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and=20
Enron look into this to make sure we're in agreement before we bring a=20
partner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get=20
back to me.

Chris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?

Thanks.

Ben
