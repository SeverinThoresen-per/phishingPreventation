Thanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at bu=
dget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations te=
am of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets unde=
r Enron Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, o=
ur system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.=
  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!

Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me ab=
reast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit =
for you. =20

While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist =
attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you =
that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --Sally=20

Sally,
As you may already know, I've been working with Cindy on a project that may
be potentially rewarding to us both...I have become CEO of an people
assessment company that has grown out of Vanderbilt University.  But more
importantly is you.  Cindy was kind enough to keep me abreast on the
wonderful professional promotion that has been granted to you.  In brief,
although our time together was quite short, I immediately realized why there
was such positive talk about you.  Congratulations. All my best,

Geoffrey Mann
