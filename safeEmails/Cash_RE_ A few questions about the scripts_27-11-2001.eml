Mary, based on the most current information: =20
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not =
dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any menti=
on of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the pas=
t, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contri=
butions over the past year. =20
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, shoul=
d not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aar=
on Brown)=20
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being=
 terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculate=
d to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific t=
erm date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance =
pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mac=
kin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and t=
he corresponding explanations.    =20

Subject:	A few questions about the scripts

I have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me

1.  For A and B employees, will there be bonuses.  It's crossed out on the A=
 script and left in the B script.
2.  In the C script:
	Please explain what a 60-day notice w/o severance plan off-set means.
	When does severance go into effect for C employees?  It's not clear in the =
script.

Thanks.
