		 Subject: Steve Tick's Restructuring Proposal

Steve Tick's PPA restructuring proposal (which we now refer to as the "ten=20
points of light") is generally as follows:

The partnership agrees to amend the interest rate adjustment to capacity=20
charges, which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of a lower=20
$/kW-mo. charge.  Per Steve, the modified adjustment should take into accoun=
t=20
plant capacity, use of the term vs. construction loan amount and a 1.00 vs.=20
1.25 coverage ratio.  Steve also advocates that the loan balance be reduced=20
for the development fee collected by Tenaska at close; I wouldn't go there,=20
as Steve has told me on a number of occasions that Brazos doesn't know about=
=20
this fee.

The partnership agrees to change how the capacity rate is applied (he=20
advocates charging the new capacity rate on 240 MW and charging 50% of the=20
new capacity rate on the next 23 MW), which effectively lowers capacity=20
revenue by virtue of fewer billing determinants.

Steve's view is that items 1 and 2 need to amount to at least $3.5 MM in=20
savings to Brazos per year; more is better, >$5.0 MM is a slam dunk

The effects of items 1 and 2 are mitigated by (a) collecting a higher=20
capacity rate for some period of time after 2019 and (2) adjusting energy=20
rates through 2006 to recapture marginal energy losses.  Steve's advice on=20
these point is that we shouldn't be pigs.  As I think you know, our exposure=
=20
on point (b) is greatest when the plant runs at higher levels of capacity,=20
which causes us to consume more than 45,000 Dth/day without adequate=20
compensation through the PPA.

Brazos purchases the development site for $x (he likes to use $15 MM, which =
I=20
think is a stretch).  Steve understands that we have a $7.5 MM termination=20
payment obligation back to the original Tenaska IV partners to the extent we=
=20
wish to convey the development assets, but believes Tenaska, Inc. would be=20
willing to assume all or a portion of this commitment in exchange for an=20
agreement w/Brazos that totally eliminates its officers' liability on fraud.=
 =20
Steve appears to believe this risk is real, or he wouldn't make such a big=20
deal out of it.  He points to the use of the 1.25 coverage assumption in the=
=20
interest rate adjustment as clear evidence that Brazos made decisions based=20
on an assumption that the Tenaska partners would earn only a reasonable=20
risk-adjusted return on this project.  Even Merrill Lynch, Brazos' financial=
=20
advisor, bought off on this provision of the agreement.  Steve is willing to=
=20
go to bat with both Brazos and Tenaska on this point to see this to=20
resolution.  To the extent he's successful and we receive, for example, $10=20
MM for the development assets, this would be an immediate offset to the=20
capacity payment reductions set out under items 1 and 2.

The partnership converts the facility to EWG and, per Steve, shares the=20
benefits with Brazos.  My view is that this could just as easily be done by=20
adjusting the heat rates used for tolling purposes (i.e., after 2006 and, to=
=20
the extent applied in the energy pricing used to address his item 3, through=
=20
2006).

The partnership removes distilled water equipment and sells it in the=20
market.  Steve thinks proceeds realized from the sale should be (a) shared=20
(up to 100%) with Brazos or (b) used to purchase replacement blades that=20
could be installed during the May outage to prevent summer downtime=20
(obviously, timing is a key issue here).

Brazos is granted the right to further reduce its contract payment=20
obligations in ways that are similar to its Apache demand charge buy-out. =20
This is a Steve Tick soap-box item; he uses it as an opportunity to remind=20
Brazos that other value has been created during the facilitation process.

Steve speaks to project-level debt restructuring, and suggests that Brazos b=
e=20
granted the right to affect this restructuring within parameters that are se=
t=20
by the partnership.  I don't know what to do with this, but to say that I=20
believe there is value to restructuring debt at the project-level with=20
existing lenders in a way that leaves existing swaps in place.  Inasmuch as=20
we have always planned to take on structurally subordinated debt obligations=
,=20
there is borrowing capacity at the project level.  Since we would need to go=
=20
to the banks for consents on any of the PPA/structural changes advocated by=20
Steve, it would appear to make sense to tackle debt restructuring on the sam=
e=20
pass.  The banks would love a solution that puts the disputes to rest and=20
should be willing to both consent and lend against the cash flow of the=20
restructured project.  CoBank, who has $70 MM of the project debt (which=20
amortizes beginning in 2012), is one of the banks in the total return swap=20
with KBC by virtue of syndication.

Steve also advocates what he refers to as "equitable adjustments".  In=20
effect, he would establish a market index against which the all-in PPA price=
=20
could be compared, and would have Brazos pay a premium over it's PPA price t=
o=20
the extent the market price floats above the PPA price.  I think this is an=20
interesting concept, but we can't count on value here.  More importantly, I'=
m=20
not aware of a transparent enough price to make this work in ERCOT.

Finally, Steve advocates turning management of the project over to Brazos in=
=20
return for a "hell or high water" commitment on capacity payments.

Steve's view is that the "hell or high water" commitment, together with the=20
settlement itself, makes PPE's partnership interests more marketable.  I'm=20
not sure we agree with his view of the risks relative to the overall=20
liquidity of our interests.  However, we need to recognize that he's working=
=20
with substantially more information than we are at this point from the=20
perspective of what he knows about Brazos' side of the case.

My reaction is that there are things we can work with in Steve's proposal. =20
Chris and I are looking at the pricing/cost offset details more closely, and=
=20
should have something to discuss shortly.

Dan, sorry I missed you yesterday.  Let me know when you'd like to place the=
=20
call to Tom Moore to update him on the current activity.  Also, do you have =
a=20
sense yet for who we'll be working with on this internally?

Happy Trails...

Rick
