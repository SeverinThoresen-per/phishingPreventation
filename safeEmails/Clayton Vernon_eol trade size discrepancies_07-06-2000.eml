Vince-

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the "transaction dollars=
"=20
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index=20
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently,=
=20
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended th=
e=20
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis=20
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to=20
them of the "price" as the basis, times the quantity.

I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accurac=
y=20
very seriously.

Clayton
