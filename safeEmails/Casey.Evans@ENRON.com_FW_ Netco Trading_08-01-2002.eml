All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.    With r=
espect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early No=
vember.   The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez, and Carson.

MW - Fletch, Russell, and Jason
SE - Rogers, Suarez, Carson
ERCOT - Doug, King, Schiavone, Saibi
NE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, Broderick, Thomas (off-peak), Misra, Rogers, Makka=
i, Step, Schneider
Options - Arora, Stalford, Wang, Gualy
Real-Time - Forney (ERCOT), Baughman (MW/SE), Miguel (MW/SE)

Remember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.   N=
one of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas.

Kevin,

In an attempt to begin the setup of trading books and desks for Netco, we wi=
ll need a list of desk assignments (i.e. which trader will be trading which =
region) and the regional organization (i.e. Northeast, Midwest, etc.) of suc=
h desks.  Also, will East traders be trading only east delivery points?

Thanks!
Casey
