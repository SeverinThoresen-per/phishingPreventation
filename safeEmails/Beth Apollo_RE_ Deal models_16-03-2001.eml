Thanks   for the note -- that helps to put it into perspective. =20
Unfortunately, since Sally is out this week, I had not seen this note.

James has all of the marginal cost information, which can be used to work=20
from  - I still believe that the approach we discussed in our meeting before=
=20
lunch today is the right one.  We need to create some customer profiles whic=
h=20
include the number of transactions at each level and for each of the=20
potential services to calculate some potential cost base scenarios ---  from=
=20
which we can gross up to a potential revenue number. =20

Rahil -- I would like to discuss the next steps, and who we put on point=20
(specifically) for each task.

Here is the message I received from Greg, which I just told you and Rahil=20
about today.=20

I would really like to use Rahil's expertise at EOL to try to size the=20
potential market going forward. On the other side, I would appreciate gettin=
g=20
feedback about the marginal per transaction cost at different volume levels=20
as presented in the document we discussed this morning. I will be available=20
to help in any way needed.

Thanks in advance for your help

We need to finalize the 4 models that have a high, low and expected case for=
=20
our businesses.  They are CommodityLogic, DealBench, TransactionHub and=20
Mid/Back Office.  DealBench should be built as an ASP as discussed,=20
CommodityLogic as an ASP, TransactionHub as we have discussed and back offic=
e=20
as you are working with Sally.     =20

We first need to agree on all the assumptions for revenue that lead to each=20
case suggested above for each business.  We then need to agree on 5 to 10=20
years of expenses so we can reach an operating margin we agree upon.  We the=
n=20
finally need to look at them and see what capital investment might be needed=
=20
to go in to each one and then finally build a pretax income statement and=20
pretax cash flow statement for each business.

The goal is to determine, within a range, the present value of each business=
,=20
based on certain assumptions, and then to determine what they are worth as a=
=20
company.

I know we are part way there on all of these initiatives, but I want this al=
l=20
finished as follows:

TransactionHub - Friday afternoon the 16th.

CommodityLogic - Tuesday afternoon the 19th

DealBench - Wednesday afternoon the 17th

Mid/Back Office - Friday the 23rd

Remember, we are trying to get a range that is approximately right that we=20
can all believe.

Your thoughts?
