Hi baby,

I sure did miss you last night. I can't wait to see you tonight and give you=
 a great big kiss on the lips. I love our picture together, we are such a cu=
te couple. I'm sure we are going to have tons of fun together.
How did you sleep?=20
I'm worried about you on your trip tomorrow. We should go get you some chain=
s tonight for the truck.
Work is going pretty good so far, hopefully it will stay that way.=20
I love you and I can't wait to see you.
Have a great day honey.

I LOVE YOU!

Craig.
