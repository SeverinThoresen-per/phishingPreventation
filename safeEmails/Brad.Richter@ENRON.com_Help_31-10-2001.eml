We have a potential deal with Allegheny for them to post a coal product on E=
nronOnline.  The total value is thin but the desk is supportive and Dan Diam=
ond has been charging ahead.  In light of Enron's position currently, do we =
gain or lose media points by announcing in the near future that EOL is allow=
ing third parties to post on their site?  If you are against this, we need t=
o crawfish our way out of the deal with Allegheny and put an all-stop on the=
 1 or 2 others we've been pursuing.  If you think it can be spun in a good w=
ay for Enron, give me your thoughts and we'll close the deal.

I know you're underwater right now, but I don't want to close this deal on t=
he assumption that you're OK and find out later you weren't.

Brad
