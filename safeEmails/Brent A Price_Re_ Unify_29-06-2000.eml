Thanks for the update.  I also want to thank everyone for a job well done. =20
You all worked great as a team and proved that IT projects can be completed=20
on time and with relatively few problems.  Unify Financial Settlements could=
=20
serve as an example for future IT project implementations.

Hey Ken,

I just wanted to let you know that the Financial Settlement group were very=20
impressed with Unify during the first training class that we had on Friday. =
=20
I did not hear any negative comments, and they even said they liked it bette=
r=20
than SIFT.  Some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are:

1.  the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
2.  the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting differen=
t=20
statement groups for different payment terms
3.  the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen=20
4.  the system is more efficient than SIFT
5.  the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the=20
line to make adjustments
6.  the ability to wire foreign currencies (really and SAP enhancement)

One thing that I did hear is that they wished they could see Enron North=20
America AND ENA Global together on the financial list screen.=20

I think the development group did a great job, and I enjoyed working with=20
everyone.  I hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will=20
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient=20
response to areas of concern and enhancements.

Thank you to the group for all of your hard work,
Becky
