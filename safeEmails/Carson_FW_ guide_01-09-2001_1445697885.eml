ESCAPEE=20
Definition:=20
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or=20
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave=20
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive=20
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an=20
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are=20
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not=20
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved.=20
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.=20
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee)=20
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns=20
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this=20
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left=20
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred. =20
COURTESY FLUSH=20
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of=20
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an=20

WALK OF SHAME.=20
WALK OF SHAME=20
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you=20
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment =20

pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a=20
COURTESY FLUSH.=20
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER=20
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You=20

the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom.=20
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)=20

Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and=20
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and=20
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this=20
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you=20
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact.=20
CAMO-COUGH=20
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the=20
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a=20
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used=20
 in=20
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE.=20
ASTAIRE=20
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD=20
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that=20
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom=20
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace.=20
WATERMELON=20
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet=20
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON =20
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.=20
HAVANA OMELET=20
