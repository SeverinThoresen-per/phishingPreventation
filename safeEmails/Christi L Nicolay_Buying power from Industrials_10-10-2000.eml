Subject: Buying power from Industrials

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES=20
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials "agent" when buying an=
=20
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial=
=20
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about=
=20
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested th=
e=20
"Impower" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for=20
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know).=20

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings=
=20
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they=20
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron=20
generally has to also file for "EWG" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due t=
o=20
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial busines=
s=20
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not=20
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates=20
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own=20
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to=20
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it=20
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a=20
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit=20
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however,=20
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation=20
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up=20
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises=20
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of=20
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or=20
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by=20
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in=20
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking=20
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets.=
"

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's=20
jurisdiction as a "public utility." =20

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it=20
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by=20
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously=20
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at=20
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot=20
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made=
=20
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly=20
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market=20
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC=20
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and=20
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).=20

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.
