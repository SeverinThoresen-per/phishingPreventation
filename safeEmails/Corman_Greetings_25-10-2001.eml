Tonya,

Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably ju=
st burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (inclu=
ding INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaitin=
g the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  Ginger and crew are so busy that=
 I imagine that things won't happen very fast. =20

Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the =
other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just=
 wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.

Shelley
