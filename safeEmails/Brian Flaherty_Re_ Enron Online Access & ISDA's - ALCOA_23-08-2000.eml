Brian,

I am sorry if you miss understand what I said but I would like to reiterate=20
that I said IF customer had a master in place, that it would also cover=20
EnronOnline but that would have to be verified by the legal group.  That is=20
why I emailed and called both Mark Taylor and Leslie Hansen and had them get=
=20
involved.    I had also explained all this to Tim Reyes with Alcoa.

It sounds like Mark has lead you in the right direction for assisting=20
customer.

Kathy=20

Subject: Enron Online Access & ISDA's - ALCOA

To all,

One of our customers, ALCOA, has been registered on EOL for the OTC metal=20
products, but is having problems accessing the trading site.

The problem stems from two areas:

1) When ALCOA accesses the trading site,  the prompt for Enron's terms and=20
conditions comes up with a further prompt to agree or disagree to the=20
conditions.  ALCOA's legal team has determined that they should not agree to=
=20
the conditions because they have an existing ISDA agreement in place with MG=
=20
Ltd.

2) ALCOA has talked to EOL's help desk (specifically Kathy Moore), who=20
subsequently has determined (I assume with Enron legal) that the current ISD=
A=20
in place with MG Ltd. is sufficient to begin trading EOL's OTC metal product=
s.

In further discussions I had with Mark Taylor today,  he basically confirmed=
=20
that the ISDA that's in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal products, but sai=
d=20
that I should confirm with either Edmund Cooper or Justin Boyd in London for=
=20
final confirmation of the legal questions, and Frank Davis for the EOL acces=
s.

In addition, Mark alluded to the probability that Enron legal/compliance doe=
s=20
not have a listing and/or copies of ISDA's that MG Ltd. has in place with=20
customers.  If you'd like, I can help facilitate that.  Please advise.

Could you confirm for me the following via telephone and/or e-mail:

1) That the current ISDA ALCOA has in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal=20
product trading.

2) That their account can access the site without the term and conditions=20
prompt.

Please contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,
BEF=20
