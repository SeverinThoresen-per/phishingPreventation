Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a=20
solution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit=
=20
(515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that=20
time.=20

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a=20
500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the=
=20
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was somethin=
g=20
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However,=20
following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a ter=
m=20
sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap=20
structure.=20

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September=20
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall=
=20
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and=20
the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produc=
e=20
a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the=20
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a=20
position that one LDC  could halt market opening.=20

Regards
Rob
