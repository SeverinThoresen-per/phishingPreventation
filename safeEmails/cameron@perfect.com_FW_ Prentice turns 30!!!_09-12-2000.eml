Hi Cameron:
Thanks for the invitation. We were really hoping to make it but things are
looking too hectic around here (trying to get holiday vane out to customers)
for us to get out of town. Thanks for thinking of us and please wish
Prentice a very happy birthday. Hope you guys have a great time.
LizAnne
