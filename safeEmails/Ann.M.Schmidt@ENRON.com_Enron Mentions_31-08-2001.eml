Two Executives Leave Houston-Based Energy Firm's Broadband Arm

Two Enron Corp. executives who headed the company's foundering broadband bus=
iness left Enron to pursue other opportunities, Enron said Thursday.=20
Ken Rice, 43, chairman and chief executive of Enron Broadband services left,=
 as did Kevin Hannon, 41, chief executive of Enron Global Assets and Service=
s. Hannon had been president and chief operating officer of the broadband un=
it.
Both men previously had other executive roles at Enron.=20
Rice had most recently been helping Enron to move its pared-down broadband o=
peration into its wholesale services division. Wall Street has been expectin=
g Rice to leave Enron.=20
Enron's broadband business suffered as the telecommunications industry melte=
d down. A deal with Blockbuster that fell through earlier this year was also=
 considered a setback.=20
For the second quarter, broadband reported a $102 million operating loss, co=
mpared with an $8 million operating loss for the same quarter a year ago.=20
When Enron reported second-quarter results in July, it said it would signifi=
cantly reduce spending in broadband "to match the reduced revenue opportunit=
ies currently available."=20
The elimination of up to 250 broadband jobs in April preceded the announceme=
nt.=20
The two departures follow Jeff Skilling's surprise announcement about two we=
eks ago that he was stepping down as Enron's chief executive officer for per=
sonal and family reasons.

Utility could raise some rates by 60 percent

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Nearly 730,000 Portland General Electric customers cou=
ld see a rate hike of 30 to 60 percent Friday if state regulators approve th=
e increase as expected.=20
PGE's 637,000 residential customers would see a rate increase of roughly 30 =
percent, while its 90,000 business customers could face increases of 40 to 6=
0 percent, according to PGE estimates.
"The price increase is completely about power costs," said Peggy Fowler, the=
 utility's president and chief executive officer. "We've tried to hold off a=
s long as we could. But these truly are unprecedented times."=20
Since late last year, utilities throughout the Northwest have been raising r=
ates by double-digit percentages. PGE avoided the trend by coming out ahead =
on power trades and deferring some costs.=20
The utility serves more Oregonians than any other in the state. Most of its =
customers are in the Willamette Valley.=20
PGE requested the increases a year ago. If the Oregon Public Utility Commiss=
ion announces Friday it has approved the request - as is expected - the new =
rates will take effect Oct. 1.=20
Customer advocacy groups questioned whether PGE could justify the need for s=
uch a large increase.=20
"They should be looking for ways to cut spending" to offset the rise in powe=
r costs, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board.=20
Julie Brandis, a lobbyist for the 19,000-member Associated Oregon Industries=
, said PGE should cut payrolls and slash operating budgets before raising it=
s rates.=20
She said rate increases of up to 60 percent mean thousands of dollars of add=
itional monthly expenses to businesses already struggling to survive.=20
"It will greatly impact the economy of Oregon," she said.=20
PGE officials said the rate increases reflect the projected costs of buying =
and generating electricity from Oct. 1 on.=20
Power costs beyond what had been anticipated for Jan. 1 through Sept. 30 hav=
e been accumulating in a deferred account set up by regulators. The company =
will file another rate request next spring to recover those costs, officials=
 said.=20
PGE serves customers by generating electricity at utility-owned power plants=
 and by buying power on wholesale markets. The split between company-generat=
ed and purchased power is roughly 50-50.=20
This year, wholesale prices on short-term, or "spot," markets have dropped d=
ramatically, from a high on May 9 of $520 a megawatt hour to Thursday's low =
of $22.22 a megawatt hour.=20
The drop hurts PGE, which earlier this year purchased extra supplies of powe=
r in anticipation of profitable trades this summer and fall.=20
PGE residential customers pay about 5.8 cents a kilowatt hour, plus a monthl=
y flat fee of $5.50. Customers use, on average, about 1,000 kilowatts a mont=
h.=20
The increase incorporates a new tiered-rate structure, in which customers pa=
y one rate for the first 225 kilowatt hours and a higher rate for additional=
 energy use.

INDIA PRESS:Fincl Cos Want MSEB To Buy Dabhol Electricity

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Indian lenders to U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s (ENE) uni=
t, Dabhol Power Co., are insisting on the resumption of the purchase of powe=
r by its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, from the 740 m=
egawatt first phase of the DPC plant, reports the Economic Times.=20
The financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India =
(P.IDB), have said that unless phase I of DPC is reactivated the cash flow o=
f DPC won't improve and it will be difficult for the project to find a buyer=
, according to the report.
The matter was discussed by a committee comprising the financial institution=
s, MSEB, Central Electricity Authority and India's Ministry of Petroleum. Th=
e MSEB has not given any commitment, but has asked the financial institution=
s to submit a formal proposal in this connection, the report added.=20
The financial institutions supporting Dabhol have an exposure of over 51.25 =
billion rupees ($1=3DINR47.14). Enron has a 65% controlling stake in the Dab=
hol project.=20
The DPC's phase I 740 megawatt power plant has been inoperative since May 29=
 after the MSEB claimed the company's power tariffs were "exorbitant and una=
ffordable," and stopped drawing electricity. Work on the roughly 95% complet=
e 1,444 megawatt Dabhol phase II was also stopped soon after the dispute beg=
an.=20
The Dabhol-MSEB dispute is before the courts.=20

POLITICALLY hard and unyielding, but economically flexible and alluring.=20
Those are the defining characteristics of the present Chinese leadership.
Even while welcoming American businessmen with open arms and going out of it=
s way to facilitate their business activities in China, Beijing never hesita=
ted to stand firm against the US when its national interests were involved.=20
It never allowed its interest in US investment flows to dilute its adherence=
 to its political principles, and it never allowed the frictions in its rela=
tions with Washington due to its adherence to its principles to prejudice it=
 in its attitude towards American businessmen. Beijing learnt that what was =
really important was not the certificate of good governance from American po=
litical leaders, but from their businessmen.=20
The Chinese leadership also learnt many years ago that:=20
* Political frictions between two capitals do not necessarily deter US busin=
essmen so long as they are assured of the safety of their lives and investme=
nts and have a free hand in making profits.=20
* In a globalising world, business interests are an important component of s=
trategic interests and no US administration, Democratic or Republican, can a=
fford to ignore the views and interests of its businessmen. Ultimately, the =
compulsions of business interests will prevail over those of ideology and po=
litics.=20
Dark clouds had gathered over US-China relations ever since Mr George Bush J=
r. was elected the US President in November last. A paranoia over what was p=
rojected as likely threats to US interests in the Asia-Pacific region due to=
 the fast-emerging Chinese economic and military power was the dominant feat=
ure of the campaign speeches, of the debates in Republican circles before th=
e inauguration, and of the actions of the new Administration in its first fe=
w months in office.=20
No other members of the new Administration reflected this paranoia more dist=
urbingly than Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the new Defence Secretary, and to a lesser=
 extent, Ms Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser. China was proje=
cted as a strategic competitor and not partner as it had been glorified to b=
e by Mr Bill Clinton, the previous President.=20
Actions such as the attention to the Dalai Lama when he visited Washington D=
C and clearance to arms sales to Taiwan in the face of Beijing's opposition =
were all influenced by the conservative, distrust- China lobby in the Republ=
ican Party.=20
Gen (retd). Colin Powell, Secretary of State, who is more a professional tha=
n an ideologue, found himself without adequate voice in policy-making with r=
egard to China in the first few months. It is the ideologues who prevailed.=20
But things started changing from the day Mr Rumsfeld allegedly issued an ord=
er suspending periodic interactions between the armed forces of the US and C=
hina, which had been initiated by the Clinton Administration as a confidence=
-building measure. It was reported that the past President, Mr George Bush S=
r, the father of the current incumbent, was shocked by this order and pointe=
d out to Gen Powell and Ms Rice the inadvisability of unnecessarily needling=
 China.=20
Mr Rumsfeld wriggled out of an embarrassing situation by claiming that his i=
nstruction for a case-by-case clearance of future interactions had been misi=
nterpreted by a Pentagon official as suspension of the interactions. It was =
from that time onwards that one could see Gen Powell playing a more active r=
ole in China policy-making and a beginning of a possible diminution in the r=
ole of Mr Rumsfeld and Ms Rice. Other influential personalities too joined i=
n strongly deploring the anti-China paranoia being created by the conservati=
ve ideologues which, they pointed out, could be counter-productive.=20
Dr Henry Kissinger, former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State,=
 was one of the strongest critics of this artificially-created paranoia. How=
 can a nation (China) with an annual defence budget of $12 billion pose a th=
reat to a nation (the US) with an annual defence budget of $350 billion, he =
asked. He pointed out that just because China was modernising its Armed Forc=
es in keeping with its present-day requirements, it could not be perceived a=
s a threat to American interests.=20
China conducted itself during these difficult months in an exemplary manner.=
 It kept up its strong criticism of the US policies towards Taiwan and Tibet=
 and on espionage flights. It joined hands with Moscow in strongly opposing =
the missile defence initiative of Mr Bush. It kept up its clandestine supply=
 of missile and missile components to Pakistan. According to American intell=
igence estimates, as quoted by the Washington Times, 12 consignments have go=
ne by ship and road to Pakistan since Mr Bush Jr assumed office. It did not =
hesitate to prosecute American nationals/residents of Chinese origin arreste=
d on charges of spying, but let them leave the country after a proforma conv=
iction.=20
At the same time, it kept reiterating its continued interest in a co-operati=
ve relationship with the US and underlining the inevitability of the restora=
tion of the warm vibrations of the past. It stepped up its imports from the =
US in order to reduce the trade deficit, which is presently unfavourable to =
Washington. It accelerated negotiations on pending business contracts with U=
S companies. According to the latest Chinese Customs figures, Chinese import=
s from the US increased 17.9 per cent to $12.5 billion as against only a six=
 per cent increase in exports to the US ($25.02 billion) during the first ha=
lf of this year.=20
Beijing reportedly permitted five of its airline companies to buy 36 Boeing-=
737 aircraft with a combined price tag of $2 billion and the Air China to pu=
rchase four Boeing 737-800s.=20
One could see the benign impact of the pressures on the Administration from =
professional strategic experts and business interests in the changed languag=
e during Gen Powell's visit to Beijing in the last week of July, 2001. After=
 his one- day talks in Beijing with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese =
leaders, he said: "We view China as a friend, not as an adversary." He never=
 once used the expression, 'strategic competitor'.=20
Gen Powell emphasised the Bush Administration's desire to build "constructiv=
e, forward-looking relations" with China. "China and the United States have =
a strong common interest in seeing a stable Asia and a world where economies=
 can thrive and security needs can be met," he added.=20
He admitted that major differences remained on issues such as Taiwan, China'=
s proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as its continued supply =
relationship with Pakistan and human rights, but added that Beijing had agre=
ed to the subjects of proliferation and human rights being further discussed=
 by experts from the two countries before President Bush's visit to China in=
 October.=20
Thus, one could see that Sino-US relations are on the mend as a result of re=
-thinking in Washington. Mr Clinton too came to office in January, 1992, wit=
h a negative image of China which later on turned into a very positive one, =
but this transformation took some time to come about. In the case of Mr Bush=
, it has come about within seven months of his assuming office.=20
India has valuable lessons to learn from this. Our policy towards the US is =
perceived by many to be politically malleable, but economically devoid of co=
ntent. The rapidity with which we welcomed Mr Bush's missile defence initiat=
ive, even when the US' closest allies such as the UK preferred to wait and s=
tudy before reacting, the way we seem to have allowed the positive assessmen=
t of the US security experts on Pakistan's Gen Pervez Musharraf to prevail o=
ver the negative assessment of our own experts, thereby, creating the Agra e=
mbarrassment, show a tendency to let judgments and actions in such matters b=
e influenced by US perceptions.=20
At the same time, the economic dimension of India's relations with the US ha=
s not received the required attention. Even earlier, the analysts of conserv=
ative think-tanks close to the Republican Party viewed the economic manageme=
nt of the Government as lackadaisical.=20
This negative perception seems to have been strengthened by the Enron case. =
There is, consequently, a danger of the interests of US businessmen in India=
 gradually evaporating.=20
The country seems to be under an illusion that foreign businessmen will floc=
k to it just because it has a functioning democracy, a modern legal system a=
nd a population of one billion. More than this, what is important is their p=
erception that India has a government which manages the economy competently =
and makes the business atmosphere investor-friendly, for domestic as well as=
 foreign investors. One looks in vain for such a perception.=20
