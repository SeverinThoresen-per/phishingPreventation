"Spot" Traders:

Sarah Novosel, Ray Alvarez (both from the D.C. office) and I talked to Micha=
el Goldenberg, a FERC staff attorney in the General Counsel's Office. He doe=
s not speak for the FERC but hearing his views on the order is helpful nonet=
heless. Here's a brief recap (paraphrased) of what we learned.

Q.  If the  cap falls between the time a deal is confirmed and the delivery =
hour, is the supplier liable for the difference?

A.     This is a legitimate question and will only be fully answered by maki=
ng a formal motion for clarification from the FERC. [Michael mentioned that =
perhaps CAISO could resolve this but this issue really applies to  markets o=
utside of CAISO, so it is unlikely CAISO can resolve this.]  The order can p=
robably be read two ways.  One interpretation is that the only cap that appl=
ies is the one in effect in the delivery hour, in which case the supplier  i=
s liable for refund (or if a generator, a cost justification filing).  Anoth=
er is that the cap that applies is the one in effect when the deal is negoti=
ated.  Part of his reasoning for making the latter interpretation is that th=
e order clearly wants to provide certainty to the market and part of the ord=
er allows prices to be "negotiated up to the maximum price," (p. 42) which c=
ould be read as allowing the cap to the be the one in effect at time of nego=
tiation.

Michael indicated that the FERC  is not setting up any sort of formal compli=
ance or monitoring, so, for markets subject to the cap (other than those ope=
rated by CAISO) it will be up to the buyer to complain that it was sold abov=
e-cap power.  [Thus reiterating that the risk of refund depends in part on t=
he counter party to the deal.]

Q. Cash deals are normally traded the day before delivery.  However, some ca=
sh deals are traded more than 24-hours out.  Also, cash traders could intent=
ionally start making deals farther out as a way to avoid the cap.  Are such =
cash deals exempt from cap or is that a "loop hole"?

A. The FERC order is very clear that the cap applies only to deals that are =
traded on the day of or day before the first delivery hour, so, the describe=
d deals are exempt and he does not consider it to be a "loop hole".  FERC co=
uld change the rules in the future, of course, but he reads the order as cle=
ar on this matter.
