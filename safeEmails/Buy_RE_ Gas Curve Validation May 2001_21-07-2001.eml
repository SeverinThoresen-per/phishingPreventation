He's right in that looking at curves where we generally don't have much of a=
 position, will not add much value. I'm having Frank Hayden check this asser=
tion.=20
Bottom line is, again, the middle office groups are either poorly staffed, p=
oorly skilled or too distracted to administer the risk process effectively.

When Frank comes back to me I'm tempted to suggest two things, for which I'l=
l need Whalley/Lavorato/Beck to buy into:

1	Curve validations are submitted to us before anybody else;
2	They concentrate on more significant factors (e.g. Volatility, correlation=
, the Alberta Power curve)
