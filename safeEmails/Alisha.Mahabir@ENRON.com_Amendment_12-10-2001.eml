Jennifer,

per your discussion with myself and Debra Perlingiere, here are the sentence=
s that we would like to add to the amendment you sent us.

"All capitalized terms used herein unless otherwise defined shall have the m=
eanings given to them in the Base Agreement."

"This First Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which taken t=
ogether shall consitute one and the same instrument."



Thanks so much for your patience and understanding on this matter,

Alisha
