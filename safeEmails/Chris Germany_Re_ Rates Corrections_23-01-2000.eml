Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rate=
s=20
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause=20
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will b=
e=20
handled via a manual line item. =20

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,=20
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are=20
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same=20
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be=20
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any=20
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team wil=
l=20
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time t=
o=20
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that w=
e=20
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within=20
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by=20
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system an=
d=20
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been=20
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be=20
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999=20
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management=20
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 productio=
n=20
forward. =20

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by=20
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,=
=20
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.
