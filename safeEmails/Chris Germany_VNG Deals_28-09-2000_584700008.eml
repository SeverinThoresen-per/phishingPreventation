I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;

Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.

Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco,=20
CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).

Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG=
=20
deal, a confirm is faxed to them.

AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as=20
production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up=20
with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most=
=20
of the pricing done in a worksheet.
