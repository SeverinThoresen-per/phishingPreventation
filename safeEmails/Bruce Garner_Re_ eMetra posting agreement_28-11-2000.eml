Andy,

Thanks for taking the time in reading the posting agreement and making=20
comments. =20

It is worth remembering that given a choice we would not be entering into=20
this posting agreement.    The historical agreement with MG dictates many of=
=20
the variances we will see from your other posting agreements.

Given the short time frame here, Justin is in the process of trying to set u=
p=20
a call with Travis and you for later today.  I have tried to address a coupl=
e=20
of the points you raise below.

regards
bruce

Subject: eMetra posting agreement

I have read and reviewed the Posting Agreement. Let me preface my comments b=
y=20
saying that I'm sure there is stuff in the Posting Agreement that I am=20
missing and I really want Travis McCullough to review it. I'm also curious a=
s=20
to why in certain sections it is faithful to the agreement I sent  and in=20
other places seems to stray or omits things. Anyway here are my comments:

1). Whereas (A). How many eMetra platforms are there ? what does=20
"collectively the Platforms" mean ? The agreement should be specific as to=20
which platforms eMetra can display prices on.  There are two platforms one=20
physical and one financial.  The primary focus of this agreement is on=20
financial platform.

2). Regulatory Event, This language should really mirror the Posting=20
Agreements in place. The language should cover the situation that if any of=20
the events mentioned subject Enron or any of its affiliates to regulation it=
=20
is a Regulatory Event, even if it does not impact upon the way eMetra=20
conducts its business as contemplated by the agreement.

3). Term 2.2, There is no time limit on the date that eMetra commences LME=20
trading. Given that the language is worded as the later of" this leaves them=
=20
with all the leverage. It should be the earlier of. This is a big one as the=
y=20
could sit around forever trying to make it work and we are still bound by an=
=20
agreement that runs 18 months from forever.  I agree with you on this one. =20
Starting the clock now does not work but we should be able to set the clock=20
at 18 months from Ap 30, 2001.

4). Establishment and Maintenance of Interfaces 4.1 We need to agree on who=20
is responsible for what interfaces in this agreement, upfront. These were=20
detailed in the agreement I sent to you. They are to responsible for=20
maintaining the interfaces so we do not want to build them. In general we ar=
e=20
responsible for specifying the interfaces and they are responsible for=20
building and operating them. Once again, please refer to the posting=20
agreement that was sent for the exhibits detailing this.=20

5). Execution of Transactions 5.1 All parties agree to be bound by Enron's=20
General Terms and Conditions.  We can discuss on the phone call.

6) Execution of Transactions 5.2.3 Please use the exact language from the=20
Posting  Agreement sent. This wording is unclear. There is no time of=20
transacting as there is no transaction unless price and volume are available=
=20
at time of receipt of proposed transaction.

7). Execution of Transactions General comment: There is no language referrin=
g=20
to eMetra taking responsibility for Mapping Errors. This is a big issue. We=20
will not be responsible if they incorrectly display our prices, i.e. 3 mo.=20
Aluminium displayed as 6 mo. Aluminium. Please refer to Posting Agreement fo=
r=20
language.  I agree

8). Co-Operation 7.2 and 7.3 I would like to see both of these deleted. We=20
have not given this to anyone else and it seems to be indirect conflict with=
=20
13. This section pretty much rules out that we market EnronOnline to our=20
customers and I don't see how we can live with it.  I think we would be=20
willing to substitute some form of non-disparagement language in its place. =
=20
We are balancing a couple of issues here.  Some of this is specific for=20
Emetra.  John Sherriff has been involved in the business issues that have=20
been agreed to.  Not withstanding the support of Emetra, we believe we have=20
the freedom to market EOL and are released from the non-compete.

9). Default and Termination 9.1.1  How is the release from the non-compete=20
tied to breach of this agreement ? There is no link between breach under thi=
s=20
agreement and non-compete.

10). Default and Termination 9.1.1 Strike the term material from sentence.=20
All parts of this agreement are material or they wouldn't be in it. Fine

11).  Default and Termination 9.1.4 and Enron Operational Failure. This is=20
too broad. Only the failure of an aspect of the Enron platform that affects=20
participants ability to conduct business with Enron through eMetra is=20
relevant.  Fine=20

12). Cost and Expenses. eMetra bears all costs relating to connectivity (i.e=
=2E=20
T1's)  between eMetra to the Enron platform. Fine

13). Assignment should read "eMetra's right to display Enron's prices..." =20
Fine

As I said earlier I'm sure there are things I 've left out and strongly=20
suggest that Travis review it before signing.


Thanks,
Andy
