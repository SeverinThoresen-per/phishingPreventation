I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please chec=
k all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't w=
ant to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the=
 rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to fo=
rward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has alread=
y been approved is deleted.  Thanks.=20

Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put i=
t in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in G=
alveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next =
follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have=
 asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Me=
lissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voi=
ce mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact number=
s) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then pl=
ease delete all e-mails from Melissa. =20

Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Cent=
er for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Scho=
ppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these=
 e-mails. =20

E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I =
can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks. =20

This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remai=
n.  Thanks.  --Sally=20
