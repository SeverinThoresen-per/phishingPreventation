Enron Seeks Cash Infusion Of $2 Billion

Enron Corp., looking to convince Wall Street that it can cope with an escala=
ting financial crisis, has held initial discussions with private-equity firm=
s and power-trading companies for a capital infusion of at least $2 billion,=
 people familiar with the matter say.=20
The Houston energy concern, unable to tap the public capital markets at a ti=
me when it needs to shore up its balance sheet, has approached such big-name=
 buyout firms as Blackstone Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to gauge thei=
r interest. Enron seeks a cash infusion in exchange for an equity stake in E=
nron, among other terms. In addition, a number of companies involved in powe=
r trading, a core business for Enron, have expressed an interest in making a=
n investment. The identity of the companies making overtures couldn't be det=
ermined. Prominent energy companies with power-trading operations include An=
glo-Dutch oil concern Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy Corp=
=2E, of Charlotte, N.C., Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, and El Paso Corp.,=
 also of Houston. Another well-known investor from outside the industry was =
approached but declined Enron's offer.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to r=
aise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expecte=
d. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a=
 time when its access to the financing markets is drying up. One potential f=
inancier is General Electric Co.'s GE Capital unit, which also has been appr=
oached by Enron. GE, of Fairfield, Conn., has no interest in an outright tak=
eover of Enron, but it could take on a small stake or make a financing commi=
tment and it has had discussions to that effect, according to one person fam=
iliar with the matter. GE declined comment.=20
"You would expect everybody that is in the business and understands power tr=
ading would make a phone call," one person familiar with the matter said. A =
capital infusion would be one way to help restore Enron's credibility with W=
all Street, as it would show that the so-called smart money is willing to be=
t on a turnaround. Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay is eager to secure a deal as e=
arly as this week, these people say.=20
An Enron representative declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Dynegy. =
Spokesmen for Blackstone and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice declined comment.=20
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction=
 in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnersh=
ips headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reporte=
d a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron sec=
ured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral=
=2E=20
Enron's stock price has tumbled in line with the developments, falling more =
than 60% since mid-October. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite t=
rading, Enron was down 13 cents at $11.17.=20
Yesterday, ratings concern Fitch Inc. downgraded Enron's senior unsecured de=
bt to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus. Enron's senior unsecured debt now i=
s rated just a notch above junk bond, or high-yield, status. Last week, Stan=
dard & Poor's Corp. lowered its credit rating on Enron to triple-B, while Mo=
ody's Investors Service lowered its rating to Baa2.=20
Given such high-profile problems, the declining stock price and potential fo=
r further SEC action, any investors likely would insist on a close scrutiny =
of Enron's finances and may seek board seats in exchange for a stake. One po=
tential investor said his firm was unlikely to make a commitment unless Enro=
n offered terms that were too good to pass up.=20
"It is inherently risky to invest in a company that is under investigation, =
when the outcome of that investigation is unknown," said Joel Papernick, a p=
artner in New York at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, a law f=
irm that isn't involved in the matter.=20
Any transaction likely would take the form of a convertible-preferred stake,=
 in which an investor receives a safe, bond-like interest payment and then c=
an convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a s=
pecified level. It also is possible that Enron would enter such transactions=
 with more than one party. For instance, a $2 billion investment may be too =
big for one private-equity firm, so Enron may need to get a couple of potent=
ial investors on board. Another way to shield an investor's risk could be fo=
r a private-equity firm to invest in an asset owned by Enron instead of inve=
sting in the parent company.=20
Analysts are divided as to whether Enron will seek an investment from a priv=
ate equity firm or a company that already is in the power-trading business. =
Some analysts say the most logical investor would be someone who already und=
erstands the deregulated energy markets that Enron helped pioneer. There als=
o are social factors that could influence whose infusion of cash, ultimately=
, is accepted.=20
Dynegy long has been regarded as an Enron "wannabe," because it has a histor=
y of following moves that Enron has made. After Enron purchased the Portland=
 General Electric utility in 1997, Dynegy made a successful bid to buy Illin=
ova Corp. which it acquired in February 2000. After Enron launched its succe=
ssful Internet-based commodities trading platform, EnronOnline, in November =
1999, Dynegy developed its rival DynegyDirect platform.=20
One big difference between the two companies is that Enron has pursued an "a=
sset light" strategy in recent years, trying to control the output of gas fi=
elds and power plants without actually owning them. Dynegy has been much mor=
e comfortable owning hard assets and was a big purchaser of power plants in =
California in 1998, for example.=20
The two companies, with headquarters in downtown Houston, are seen as die-ha=
rd rivals. That could make it difficult for Mr. Lay to accept any overture f=
rom Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson. Dynegy's largest single investor is Chevro=
nTexaco Corp., of San Francisco, which has profited handsomely from a 28% eq=
uity stake in Dynegy.=20
An overture from Coral Energy, Royal Dutch Shell's marketing and trading uni=
t, might receive a more receptive response from Enron, some onlookers say.=20
Coral isn't one of the biggest energy traders, but it carries a triple-A rat=
ing that is unusual for an energy-trading concern. Coral acts as the exclusi=
ve marketer of Shell's North American natural-gas production, as well as for=
 the power generation, gas pipeline and gas-storage assets controlled by Int=
erGen, a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel Group Inc., the big San Francisc=
o engineering and consulting firm.=20

Enron Seeks Investors to Raise $2 Billion in Cash, WSJ Says
2001-11-06 02:31 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader which has lost 86 percent of its market value this
year, is striving to raise at least $2 billion in cash by asking
private-equity firms and power-trading companies to buy stakes,
the Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.

     Enron held preliminary talks with Blackstone Group LP and
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. to discuss a cash infusion, the
paper said. Additionally, a number of unidentified power-trading
companies have expressed an interest in investing in Enron, the
Journal said.

     The Fitch rating agency said it may cut Enron Corp.'s credit
rating to below investment grade if Enron fails to cut debt or if
its business slows further. Enron is struggling to borrow money
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started
investigating partnerships run by former chief financial officer.

     The partnerships bought and sold Enron shares and assets,
with the trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay wants to secure an investment as
early as this week, the Journal said. The company has also talked
with General Electric Co.'s GE Capital unit, which might be
interested in taking a small stake in Enron or in making a
financial commitment, the paper said, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the matter.

     Enron approached the private-equity firms because previously
announced plans to raise cash by selling assets have slowed, the
paper said. An investment by a private-equity firm could restore
the company's credibility with Wall Street, the paper reported.

     An investment in a company under investigation is risky and
Enron may need more than one investor to secure the $2 billion it
wants, the Journal said. Investors are likely to prefer a
convertible-preferred stake that would pay them interest, like a
bond, and yet could still be traded for stock once the share price
rises to an agreed target, the Journal said.

     Analysts are split between those that think Enron want a
private equity firm to invest and those that say Enron will opt
for a company in the same business, the Journal reported.




Enron's German Shares Drop After WSJ Says It Seeks $2 Billion
2001-11-06 06:53 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s German shares
fell as much as 6 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported
the No.1 energy trader is seeking to raise at least $2 billion by
selling stakes to private equity firms and power traders.

     Enron held talks with Blackstone Group LP and Clayton,
Dubilier & Rice Inc. the paper said. A number of unidentified
power-trading companies also are interested in investing, the
Journal said, naming Dynergy Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and Reliant
Energy Inc. as potential stakeholders.

     Houston, Texas-based Enron is seeking investors because its
plan to sell assets has slowed, the paper said. An investment by a
private equity firm may bolster the company's reputation as fund
raising in falling stock markets gets harder, the Journal said.

     Investing in a company under investigation is risky, though,
and Enron may need more than one investor to secure the cash, the
paper said. Investors will prefer a convertible-preferred stake
that will pay interest, like a bond, and yet may still be traded
for stock if the shares rise to an agreed target.

     The company's shares in Germany fell as much as 78 cents to
12.10 euros. The stock declined 86 percent this year.

     Chairman Kenneth Lay wants to secure an investment as early
as this week, the Journal reported. Enron also talked with General
Electric Co.'s GE Capital unit, which may be interested in taking
a small stake, the paper said, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.

                          Analysts Split

     Analysts are split between those who think Enron wants a
private equity partner and those who say Enron will opt for a
company in the same business, the Journal reported.

     The Fitch rating agency said it may cut Enron Corp.'s credit
rating to below investment grade if it fails to cut debt or if its
business slows further. Enron is struggling to borrow money after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The partnerships bought and sold Enron shares and assets.
Those trades cost Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity. Concern over Enron's dealings with the
partnerships have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where
most large corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

Enron Long-Term Debt Rating May Be Cut to Junk Status by Fitch
2001-11-06 01:11 (New York)

Enron Long-Term Debt Rating May Be Cut to Junk Status by Fitch

     Houston, Nov. 6 (Bloomberg) -- The Fitch rating agency said
it may cut Enron Corp.'s credit rating to below investment grade
if the world's biggest energy trader fails to cut debt or if its
business slows further.

     Fitch yesterday cut Enron's long-term credit rating two
notches to the lowest investment grade, or ``BBB-,'' from
``BBB+.'' On Friday, Standard & Poor's cut Enron's rating one
notch to S&P's second-lowest investment grade, or ``BBB,'' from
``BBB+.''

     Enron, which has lost more than 86 percent of its market
value this year, is struggling to borrow money after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating
partnerships run by its former chief financial officer. The
partnerships bought and sold Enron shares and assets, with the
trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity.

     Fitch said in a statement that its downgrade reflects ``the
difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the
face of an erosion in investor confidence.''

                              Talks

     Enron has held preliminary talks with private-equity firms
and power-trading companies to raise at least $2 billion, the Wall
Street Journal reported today, citing unidentified people familiar
the matter.

     Enron has approached Blackstone Group LP and Clayton,
Dubilier & Rice Inc. to discuss a cash infusion in exchange for a
stake in the company, the paper said. Additionally, a number of
unidentified power-trading companies have expressed an interest in
making an investment in Enron, the Journal said.

     Questions about Enron's dealings with the partnerships have
shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large
corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.
     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. refused to participate in a $1
billion loan to Enron because it was unwilling to risk its capital
on a client with falling credit ratings that has been using its
investment-banking services less often, according to people
familiar with the matter.

     Still, Enron secured a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. after agreeing to use the
company's natural-gas pipelines as collateral.

                               Cash

     ``While its (Enron's) current cash position appears adequate,
securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising
additional capital would be a favorable development,'' Fitch said.

     Enron Corp. is in talks to sell its half stake in a natural
gas joint venture with SK Corp., an official of Korea's top oil
refiner said yesterday. Enron said in 1998 the gas distribution
venture with SK would have a capitalization of about $450 million.

     ``Enron will probably sell its Korean operations at a loss
because of its financial problems,'' Lee Kwang Hoon, an analyst at
Good Morning Securities Co. in Seoul, said yesterday. Enron's
difficulties raising funds may prompt it to pull out of all of its
overseas ventures except for China, he said.

     Fitch also cut its rating on Enron's subordinated debt to
``BB,'' or below investment grade status.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Lower power prices aid PG&E Corp.
By JULIE EARLE.

PG&E Corp, the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric, yesterday said that wholesal=
e power prices had stabilised in California, and its reorganisation was prog=
ressing well.=20
This suggests the worst might be over in the state's power crisis, which sen=
t prices soaring and dragged PG&E into bankruptcy.
Enron, the US energy trader, which is among PG&E's 30,000 creditors and is o=
wed $500m, also said recently that the California situation was improving.=20
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after it amassed ne=
arly $9bn in debt by buying power on the open market at sharply higher price=
s that it could not pass on to customers.=20
PG&E Corp yesterday said that the cost of buying electricity for PG&E droppe=
d 69 per cent to $697m in the third quarter, from $2.23bn a year ago.=20
The average price of power in California is 75 per cent lower than in the ye=
ar-ago quarter.=20
"Prices have stabilised as we predicted they would. If customers can see the=
 true cost of power then they will regulate themselves," said a PG&E Corp sp=
okesman.=20
"Now, usage is down and prices have come down," he added.=20
The lower electricity costs helped PG&E Corp to more than treble its third-q=
uarter net income to $771m, or $2.12 a share, from $225m, or 62 cents a shar=
e a year ago.=20
Sales fell 16 per cent to $6.3bn, from $7.5bn.=20
Peter Rigby, utilities analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agenc=
y, yesterday said that there was "guarded optimism" that the trend of lower =
wholesale prices would continue.=20
PG&E Corp said it hoped to learn before the year-end that its restructuring =
plan filed in September was "reasonable". The plan is to split the parent an=
d the utility into stand-alone companies, with the transfer of some assets t=
o PG&E's unregulated units.=20
Ratepayers, however, fear that such a move would take PG&E as well as anothe=
r utility, Southern California Edison, out of the oversight of the state reg=
ulatory body, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).=20
Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, said recently that a settlement with the CPU=
C to keep Edison out of bankruptcy was good news for the California power si=
tuation.=20

Dabhol Power Company, the Indian arm of the troubled Enron energy group, yes=
terday moved closer to abandoning its role in a controversial $2.9bn power p=
roject near Bombay.=20
DPC said it was preparing to hand over the 2,184MW asset to its sole custome=
r, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, and would demand compensation based =
on an independent valuation.
Bankers said that, under the terms of the contract, MSEB was obliged to buy =
the distressed asset because it had defaulted on payments, the cause of a br=
eakdown in relations between the two parties.=20
Yesterday MSEB said it refused to take "cognisance" of DPC's issue of a "not=
ice of asset transfer" because the Indian company had withdrawn from the con=
tract six months ago, an act of defiance which DPC says was invalid.=20
MSEB ceased taking power from the plant in May, alleging contractual misrepr=
esentation. Phase one of the complex is complete and the second stage was ap=
proaching completion before the dispute effectively killed off work.=20
"This notice formally sets in motion the valuation process of Dabhol's asset=
s in connection with the termination of the power purchasing agreement," DPC=
 said yesterday.=20
The US company's initiative yesterday comes days before it can legally issue=
 a final termination notice on the $2.9bn power project and amid a flurry of=
 financial diplomacy by the project's Indian and foreign lenders to salvage =
the country's biggest foreign direct investment.=20
Indian financial institutions, which carry a large exposure to the project a=
s lenders and as guarantors of foreign loans, are under pressure to find a s=
olution ahead of the visit by Atal Behari Vajpayee, Indian prime minister, t=
o Washington this week.=20
Enron's move runs parallel to efforts by Kenneth Lay, chairman of the Housto=
n-based company, to seek full compensation of about $1bn for itself and two =
smaller US equity holders, General Electric and Bechtel. The fourth and fina=
l equity holder is MSEB, which holds a 15 per cent stake.=20

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) today served a notice of asset=
 transfer on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). This notice is =
a precursor to issuing a final termination notice (FTN) to the board and=20
formally kicks off the process of valuation of DPC's assets, a statement iss=
ued by the company said.
DPC had secured the permission of its lenders for serving the transfer notic=
e in early October. The transfer notice is yet another step in the Enron sag=
a following its payments dispute with MSEB.=20
DPC had served a preliminary termination notice in May, 2001 and MSEB had re=
taliated by rescinding the power purchase agreement (PPA) and refusing to bu=
y power. After the serving of the preliminary notice, there was a cooling of=
f period of six months. This was to give the two sides enough time to arrive=
 at an amicable solution, failing which a FTN has to be served.=20
"DPC would still prefer to resolve this dispute amicably through negotiated =
purchase by the Indian government and financial institutions of the foreign =
sponsors' equity, including offshore lenders' debt. However, ongoing discuss=
ions between DPC, the Indian government and FIs are yielding no significant =
progress toward a fair and reasonable solution. Consequently, DPC is left wi=
th little choice other than to serve the transfer notice to MSEB, which draw=
s us closer to final termination of the PPA," the DPC statement added.

Shell: Enron India Oil, Gas Assets Buy Talk "Speculative"

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group's (RD) unit in India Tue=
sday described as "speculative" industry talk that it was interested in acqu=
iring Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian upstream assets, if BG Group PLC's (BRG) ac=
quisition of the assets collapses.=20
"We wouldn't comment on market speculation," said S. Ravi, Shell's corporate=
 spokesman in India.
The New Delhi-based managing director of Shell India Production Development =
BV - Shell's oil and gas exploration division in the country - also declined=
 to comment on the matter when contacted by Dow Jones Newswires. He reiterat=
ed that the industry talk was "speculative."=20
Industry sources have said Shell has expressed an interest in acquiring Enro=
n India's upstream assets and held informal talks with BG's unit in New Delh=
i at the end of October to discuss the matter.=20
BG paid US$388 million for Enron's 30% stake in oil and gas fields offshore =
western India in October, but the sale is subject to a number of consents an=
d conditions including confirmation from Enron and Gas India's joint venture=
 partners - Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.=
REL) - that BG will inherit field operator status from Enron.=20
ONGC and Reliance Industries are challenging BG's goal of acquiring Enron's =
operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas=
 field. As reported Thursday, BG said it will extend the negotiation period =
on the operatorship of the fields indefinitely.=20
The company has threatened to walk away from the deal if it didn't win outri=
ght operatorship.=20
"Shell are willing to enter if BG walk out - they're standing in line," an i=
ndustry source said. He added Shell was amenable to a joint-partnership, imp=
lying it was flexible on the issue of operator status.=20
Another source added, "Global developments indicate that Shell may take over=
 (the Indian upstream assets of) Enron, and that may change the equation in =
India."=20
Analysts say BG's bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resist=
ance from ONGC and Reliance. Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India ho=

ent.=20

BG India was unavailable for comment.=20
According to a report published January in India's Financial Express, Shell =

Seven Oil-Services, Drilling Firms Record 10% Share-Price Hit Last Week.

11/06/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

Shares of many leading energy companies suffered sharp share-price declines =
last week amid a drop in the broader equity market and falling crude oil pri=
ces.=20
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3% to close at 9,323 on Friday, foll=
owing a gloomy week for broad economic fundamentals. The US Department of Co=
mmerce announced that the US economy shrank by 0.4% in the third quarter - t=
he first quarterly drop in economic growth since first-quarter 1993 - and th=
e Department of Labor reported that US unemployment soared to 5.4% last mont=
h, up from 4.9% in September.
Concerns about the faltering economy created anxiety about crude oil demand.=
 The price of front-month light, sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exch=
ange (Nymex) closed at $20.18/barrel on Friday, down nearly $2/bbl on the we=
ek (OD Nov.5,p3).=20
US natural gas prices continued to firm, with front-month Henry Hub prices o=
n the Nymex closing at $3.24/million Btu, up 20=A2 on the week.=20
Although gas prices rose, the drop in oil prices caused some oil-services an=
d drilling companies to give back some of the big gains they had recorded th=
e prior week (OD Oct.30,p6). Halliburton, Pride International, Noble Drillin=
g, Petroleum Geo-Services, Ensco International, Schlumberger, Transocean Sed=
co Forex, and Global Marine each saw their shares fall by 10% or more last w=
eek (see table).=20
Still, corporate news was the catalyst for the biggest share-price losers. H=
ouston-based Genesis Energy, which operates crude oil pipelines and is an in=
dependent gatherer and marketer of crude, suffered the worst drop, at 37.5%.=
 The sharp decline was precipitated by news that the limited partnership wou=
ld reduce quarterly distributions from 20=A2 to 10=A2 due to a credit crunch=
=2E=20
Unsurprisingly, Houston-based energy trading giant Enron was near the top of=
 share-price losers list for last week. The stock has been in a free-fall si=
nce early October due to a rash of news that included the departure of two t=
op executives and the revelation of serious balance sheet problems. Last wee=
k, Enron shares plunged by nearly 27% after credit ratings agency Moody's do=
wngraded the company's corporate credit rating and provided a gloomy outlook=
 for its future (OD Nov.5,p1).=20
Among last week's stock winners, troubled Norwegian service firm Kvaerner to=
pped the list with a gain of about 24%. Kvaerner shares jumped after the com=
pany agreed to a financial reorganization plan with its biggest shareholder,=
 Russian major Yukos, and its top creditors (OD Oct.31,p6).=20
CMS Energy saw its shares rise by about 7% on the back of higher gas prices =
and the sale of its gas operations in Equatorial Guinea to Marathon for near=
ly $1 billion in cash (OD Nov.5,p1).=20

Gas Prices Plunge on Weather Forecasts, Enron-Linked Market Maneuvers.

11/06/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

Natural gas prices were pummeled Monday on more forecasts for extended balmy=
 temperatures through late November.=20
The December natural gas futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchang=
e (Nymex) settled at $2.922/million Btu on Monday, down 32.6=A2.
The fundamental argument for lower gas prices has been intact for some time,=
 supported by mild weather in key consuming regions this week and forecasts =
for more of the same through the third week of November. The National Weathe=
r Service's new forecast for the next six to 10 days sees a broad area of ab=
ove-normal temperatures covering most of the US, with below-normal readings =
relegated to portions of the East Coast, West Coast, and Florida.=20
But fundamentals aside, there is emerging evidence that technical price supp=
ort - arguably linked to Enron's financial travails and subsequent maneuvers=
 in the market - is also eroding.=20
A major liquidation of contract positions on the Nymex has occurred amidst t=
he Houston-based company's much-publicized financial problems. Recent open i=
nterest in the front-month contract peaked on Oct. 25 at 374,681 contracts, =
and then fell off a cliff, down 12% over the next four trading days. The fir=
st reports of credit problems at Enron began dribbling out on Oct. 24.=20
The likely cause for the open interest contraction is that Enron began unwin=
ding positions to boost its cash on hand, influencing last week's technical =
movements in gas futures.=20
According to the most recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission report, co=
mmercial long and short positions dropped by 65,429 and 56,195 contracts, re=
spectively, over the Oct. 30 trading week.=20
"The number of futures contracts outstanding (open interest), has been decli=
ning. This indicates a short covering rally in force," said Morgan Stanley f=
utures specialist Alan Levine. "Underlying fundamentals have not turned bull=
ish; we expect at least one more leg down to test $2.80 [per million Btu] in=
 the next few weeks."=20

Enron Credit Web Site Lists No Rating For Enron Corp.
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Credit is a Web site created by Enron Corp. (EN=
E) to help provide traders with tools to hedge against credit exposure - exc=
ept, it seems, when it comes to trading in Enron.=20
The Enron-operated site tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rat=
ing known as the "Enron cost of credit." The rating is expressed as an inter=
est rate, and a higher rate indicates increased credit exposure.
Previously, Enron ranked itself among the companies for which it provides da=
ta, but a recent trip to the site showed that when asked for Enron's own cos=
t of credit, the site was "temporarily not showing prices for this company."=
=20
Why no listing for Enron?=20
"The situation is too fluid," said an Enron spokeswoman. She said it was com=
mon for Enron Credit analysts to stop listing a company when its credit situ=
ation is "volatile."=20
Other companies currently not listed by the service include PG&E Corp. (PCG)=
, the parent of bankrupt California utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and =
Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), which is being acquired by Hewlett-Packard Co. =
(HWP).=20
The spokeswoman said she didn't know when Enron's listing had been pulled fr=
om the site, or what its last posted rating was.=20
However, not all references to Enron were pulled.=20
According to the Web site's graphing section, which charts the cost of credi=
t for companies over time, the average cost of credit for companies in the g=
as sector is 1.07, but Enron's own cost of credit is listed at 8.51 for the =
same period. This is based on a three-year liability.=20
By comparison, Enron's rivals in the merchant energy marketing and trading a=
rena have sharply lower rankings. For example, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) weighs in a=
t 1.26, while El Paso Corp. (EPG) is at 1.90, and Williams Cos. (WMB) at 1.3=
8.=20
The Enron spokeswoman was surprised to discover the listing and said it was =
appearing "by mistake." She confirmed the information was accurate. Enron is=
 updating its rating internally.=20
Enron Credit Under Microscope=20

Enron's credit has been under the microscope since the company posted a thir=
d-quarter charge of more than $1 billion to write off some failed investment=
s. The company also later disclosed an additional $1.2 billion reduction in =
shareholders' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outsid=
e partnerships run by its former chief financial officer Andy Fastow.=20
In the weeks that followed the disclosure, Enron's credit rating was first d=
owngraded by Moody's Investor Service, and then by Standard & Poor's.=20
Earlier Monday, Fitch cut Enron's senior unsecured debt to triple B-minus, a=
nd maintained the company's rating on a negative watch.=20
If Enron's debt falls below investment grade, the company will be in violati=
on of some of its financial covenants. The status could result in the compan=
y having to issue additional equity, which would dilute the value of the sto=
ck.=20
Late last week, Enron secured a $1 billion credit line in order to bolster i=
ts credit position, but needed to pledge its valuable pipeline assets as col=
lateral to secure the credit line.=20
The decline in Enron's credit rating also has basically dried up activity on=
 Enron Credit, according to a person familiar with the matter.=20
Previously, a party could purchase a credit derivative from Enron as protect=
ion against default by a third party. But doubts about Enron's own position =
have caused customers to go elsewhere for this type of protection.=20
Enron hasn't previously disclosed the revenue generated by the Web site, and=
 several analysts who follow the company said they don't calculate revenue f=
rom the business into their earnings models.=20
