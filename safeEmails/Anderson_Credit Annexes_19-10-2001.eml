Legal friends -=20

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, i=
n part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regar=
ding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks i=
s regarding the "title" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1=
 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number=
=2E   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then th=
at this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are trans=
acted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously pr=
ovided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relev=
ant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veron=
ica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterpa=
rty specific.=20

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would yo=
u guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit at=
tachments you create? =20

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions=
=2E

Thanks,
Diane
