Okay, once again, I know this is corny, but I think that it is so corny unti=
l it is also funny!!!  -- Constance

Two robins are perched on a telephone wire when one spots a whole bunch of t=
asty, juicy worms wriggling temptingly in the grass below. They swoop down a=
nd hungrily begin eating their fill. After stuffing themselves, they feel so=
 sleepy and full that they can't manage to fly back up to the wire. One robi=
n suggests that they lay in the sun for a bit while they digest their meal. =
Well, sure enough, a cat comes along and gobbles up both of them.

The cat licks her lips and says, "Man, do I love baskin' robins!"
