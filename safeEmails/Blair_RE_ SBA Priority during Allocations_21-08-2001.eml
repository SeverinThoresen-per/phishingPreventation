	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation=
 on the enhancement
	     list.  I like the idea of automating the last bullet.  I am not sure i=
f it is in CMS or elsewhere, but
	     I would like to be sure we pursue this automation.
	Thanks. Lynn

Sue,=20
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during alloc=
ations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misun=
derstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still w=
ant them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is n=
o, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have=
 priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should =
only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previ=
ous day might get "squeezed" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SB=
A shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interru=
ptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a "point", they d=
on't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have =
to be identified through the contracts department as "SBA IT"?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contrac=
t system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account ba=
lance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this=
 criteria?
