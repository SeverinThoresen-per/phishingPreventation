Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to"=20
need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.

2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates t=
o=20
the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment=
=20
on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment=20
piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that=20
happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese=
=20
explain why.

3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the=20
first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say=20
"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the=20
Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters=20
and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or=20
Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these event=
s=20
occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each=20
party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just=20
determine it?=20
