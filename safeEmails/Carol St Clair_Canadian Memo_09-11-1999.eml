Rob,

The following is an update on the ongoing situations with some of the=20
Canadian counterparties that have recently changed their corporate=20
structures.  Clearly there are some issues that should be discussed regardin=
g=20
the approach Enron should take moving forward.  On some issues, we are at a=20
point that decisions need to be made on whether or not to begin exercising=20
our contractual rights.  Other issues remain to be resolved within Credit,=20
and I expect these to be resolved within the next week.

Please call me to discuss any questions you might have with the following.=20

1) Dominion Energy Inc. acquired Remington Energy Ltd. in April 1999. =20
Remington operates as a wholly owned subsidiary under Dominion Energy Inc.=20
and has a Master Physical under which its deals have been confirmed.  It has=
=20
failed on each of the financial MAC covenants in the contract.  Repeated=20
efforts have been made to obtain a parent guaranty from Dominion including=20
conversations that have taken place with both commercial and credit=20
contacts.  Nonetheless, the counterparty to date has been unresponsive to=20
guaranty inquiries.  In the past few weeks, repeated phone calls to our=20
Dominion contacts have not been returned.  Current mark-to-market exposure=20
for Remington is approximately $9MM USD. =20

2) Marathon Canada Ltd., a wholly owned sub of Marathon Oil Company (BBB-),=20
acquired Tarragon  Oil and Gas Ltd. in August 1998.  Marathon Canada Ltd. is=
=20
a private company and requested a confidentiality agreement prior to its=20
providing financial statements.  Enron delivered the CA in July 1999 and=20
Marathon provided unaudited financials November 4.  Tarragon has a Master=20
Physical in place and has MACd on its covenants as a result of not providing=
=20
financial statements.  The financial statements provided need to be discusse=
d=20
in further detail with the counterparty.  A request for parent guaranty from=
=20
Marathon Oil Company may be the final option prior to calling for=20
collateral.  Total exposure to the combined entity is $13.5MM USD. =20

3) Talisman Energy Inc. acquired both Rigel Oil and Gas Ltd. and Highridge=20
Exploration Ltd.  We have transactions confirmed under a Master Swap and a=20
Master Physical with Highridge,  a Master Physical and a Master Swap with=20
Talisman, and a Master Physical with Rigel.  Talisman has agreed to assign=20
all outstanding deals to the existing master contracts we have in place with=
=20
Talisman Energy Inc.  As soon as possible, we need legal to draft paper to=20
Talisman moving the outstanding deals under the Rigel and Highridge contract=
s=20
to the Talisman contracts.  In the same letter, Talisman has agreed to=20
terminate the Rigel and Highridge contracts.  In return, credit has agreed t=
o=20
review the collateral thresholds and credit terms in the existing Talisman=20
contracts.  Talisman has its third quarter financials available this Friday.=
 =20
By the end of next week we should be able to send the letter to Talisman wit=
h=20
amendments, transaction transfers, and Rigel/Highridge contract=20
terminations.  Combined exposure for the entities is approximately $30MM USD=
=2E

4) Renaissance Energy Ltd. amalgamated Pinnacle Resources Ltd.  We have one=20
deal on the books, but no contracts with Renaissance. We have a long term=20
deal confirmed under a Master Swap and a long term deal confirmed under a=20
Master Physical with Pinnacle.  Pinnacle does not want to move the existing=20
Renaissance deal under the Pinnacle master agreement.  It appears as though=20
Renaissance is finalizing a sale of assets that will include some Pinnacle=20
properties.  If they sell the Pinnacle properties underlying our deals, they=
=20
said they would probably assign the outstanding deals and contracts to the=20
purchaser (presumably after obtaining Enron approval for such). =20
Renaissance's current corporate structure automatically obligates Renaissanc=
e=20
to the obligations of Pinnacle and the resulting exposure under the two=20
contracts.   Combined exposure for these entities is $13MM USD.  A credit=20
review on Renaissance will be conducted within the next week.

5)  Devon Energy Corporation acquired Northstar Energy Corporation in=20
December 1998.  Northstar continues to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary,=
=20
has an executed Master Physical, and it has MACd on each of its covenants. =20
There is approximately $9.3MM USD mark to market exposure with Northstar. =20
Northstar has had several counterparties request a parent guaranty, but has=20
not offered any to date.  Devon offers limited financial information on its=20
Canadian operations in its 10-K, but exclusive Northstar data is not=20
provided.  We have sent Northstar our preferred form of guaranty, and they=20
have been unresponsive to subsequent phone calls. =20
