Hello Chris,

Columbia of Maryland now recognizes New Power as the supplier of the old CES=
=20
customers.  Therefore, as of today, CMD assigned a whopping one dekatherm on=
=20
Gulf and TCo to New Power, instead of to ENA, from Rayne to CMD city gate.

I executed the agreements and will release them to you assuming that it's=20
okay to do so when I get the chance tomorrow.  I'd like to keep all of the=20
capacity that ENA is managing together.  Let me you if you have any problems=
=20
with that.
