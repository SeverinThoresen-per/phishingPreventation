agreed that there is some wiggle room because of the 30 days to pay language=
=2E  and, the waiver does address the signing bonus-- specifically states th=
ey won't get it. =20
=20
but with some employees, the signing bonus may exceed the amount we're offer=
ing for the waiver, so the incentive may be to not sign.  i suggest we remai=
n open to considering paying the signing bonus if we get strong push back fr=
om an applicant.

I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that=
 it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent h=
as been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to pay=
ment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.

I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the ri=
sk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand o=
r claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantim=
e, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the=
 waiver should address the signing bonus issue.

Ya'll let me know if you disagree.=20

The initial view on this was that we should not pay signing bonuses when we =
revoke offers of employment, but I have continued to give thought to the iss=
ue and my concerns.  It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as=
 a "sign-on bonus" and "signing bonus" and state that it will be paid within=
 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or i=
f the applicant revokes.  =20

I think that based on the "signing" language, applicants could argue that be=
cause they signed, we owe signing bonuses. =20

On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; =
I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign,=
 refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus. =20

Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that a=
n applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be p=
aid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here=
=2E  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of th=
e dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approx=
imately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuse=
s.=20

Any thoughts?=20
