Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are =
"baked enough" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in =
light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is =
that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale busi=
ness units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  W=
hich would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you h=
ave are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the E=
NW budget. =20
=20
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets=
 and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information t=
o rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally=20

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting =
in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent =
upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our bu=
dget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revise=
d 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and as=
sociated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that pr=
ocess been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for EN=
W? =20

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we c=
an complete this budget process. =20

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally=20
