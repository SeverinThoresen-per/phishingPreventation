I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission=20
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I=20
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.=
 =20
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO=20
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on=
=20
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport=20
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these=20
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small. =20
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??
