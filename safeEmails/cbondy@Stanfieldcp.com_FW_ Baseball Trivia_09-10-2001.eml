I figured we all needed a break from all the 9/11 and Retaliation news
we've received lately.

To get everyone in the postseason frame of mind here is a trivia
question I'm sure will stump the most avid basebvall fan.

=20

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each
position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them. =20

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo
are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :

Catcher:

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)

Second Base:

Third Base:

Short Stop:

Left Field:

Center Field:

Right Field:

=20
