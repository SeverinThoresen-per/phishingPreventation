Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor i=
s=20
now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group=
,=20
LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to=
=20
a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the=
=20
following qualifications:

1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the=20
voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and=20
controlled the previous Guarantor

 (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled b=
y=20
the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.

2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesse=
r=20
of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the=20
transfer

3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least=20
$200,000,000

4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron=

Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree=20
to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?
