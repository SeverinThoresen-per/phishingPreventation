Chris:

With the $1.5 million to ship MHI turbines 1 and 2, the summary of the numbe=
rs is the following:



Therefore, we would be about $300,000 over the original DASH.  These numbers=
 do not include transaction and financing costs.  I will do a DASH amendment=
 and am copying Louise on this email so that she is aware of what is going o=
n.  The storeage would be in a bonded warehouse, so no duties would be due a=
t this time.  On leads, we have a couple of new parties, but nothing concret=
e yet.  Ron has been working with one counterparty and may receive an offer =
in the near term.

Brett

Sounds good.  Couple of questions:=20
- are there duties/taxes due upon arrival? =20
- Were shipping / storage costs included in original DASH?
- Is the amount approx $1.5MM?
- Any leads on the MHI's?

The proposed plan on the MHI units is to ship Units 1 and 2 to the US for st=
oreage at a central location.  The storeage costs are significantly less tha=
n proposed by MHI and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be=
 beneficial for a potential sale.  From an economic perspective, it would be=
 better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly.  However=
, given a lack of any firm sale, the recommendation is to ship them to the U=
S and store.  Let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with th=
e shipment.

Thanks,
Brett

=B7	We prefer that title and risk of loss pass at Port of Import; however; n=
ot a requirement if MHI decides to extract a large premium
=B7	Will require specific storage instructions from MHI (will make a request=
 on tomorrow's call)
=B7	packing requirements to maintain warranty
=B7	other requirements (space heaters, etc.)
=B7	Inspection instructions=20
=B7	Plan to submit a request to MHI that the Unit(s) be readied for shipment=
 (est. Sept. 30 with written notice)
=B7	Carrier able to be at Port of Export by Oct. 22-31

I would like to have a followup meeting on Monday, September 24 from 10a-11a=
 on the storage of units 1&2.  Lorie -- please set up a conference room and =
forward to those copied on this e-mail.

Phil -- I would appreciate if you would take the lead on developing a shippi=
ng and storage plan.  The plan should have a timeline w/ a discussion on the=
 appropriate activity.  I would suggest that the first milestone will be our=
 formal notification to MHI informing them to ready the units for shipping w=
ill occur on the Tuesday night call.  I would hope we would have packing ins=
tructions to them at that time or soon thereafter.  Do we have a preference =
on the packing or was the plan given to us by MHI appropriate?

As far as the cost estimates in the attachment below  --

=B7	David Marshall sent me a correction for the charge used for the storage =
insurance.  It was corrected from .0002 to .000275
=B7	could someone please address the last two open items -- timeframe covere=
d with the $25k estimate for  DSU
=B7	estimated Custom Charges

Thanks, Ron

Thank you for your input on the storage of the MHI Units 1 & 2.  The followi=
ng is a summary of charges associated with shipping and storage (discussed t=
his past Monday):

=B7	Cost for Shipping components located in Kobe, Japan ($500-600k for both =
units)
=B7	Cost for Shipping components located outside of Kobe ($200k for both uni=
ts)
=B7	Handling from ship to storage (approx. $200k for both units)
=B7	Storage  ($13k per month for each unit)
=B7	Cargo Insurance (0.002 charge for the value of shipment, est. $40MM per =
unit, approx. $80k per unit)
=B7	Storage Insurance (0.0002 charge for the value of storage, est. $40MM pe=
r unit, approx. $8k per unit per [mos., 6 months, year?????])
=B7	DSU Insurance ($25k per unit per [mos., 6 months, year?????])
=B7	Custom charges (approx $__ k per unit per _______ (period))

We would propose to MHI that we would set up an entity who would provide the=
 above services on behalf of MHI and the above actual charges would be passe=
d through to E-Next (along with a fee that would be provided for MHI's accou=
nt, approx -- $200k).  The title and risk of loss would be passed at the Por=
t of Import.  The likely location for the stored units would be in or around=
 Houston or Freeport, TX at a Bonded Facility.  We will continue to modify t=
he proposal to address the needs of E-Next and future project structures.

I would appreciate confirmation from those who have provided the above estim=
ates (and, response on the questions noted above).  In addition, please forw=
ard any other items that were overlooked.

Last, MHI has not provided a counter proposal for the storage of the units i=
n Japan, but the above proposal is certainly more attractive.

Thanks, Ron.

I would appreciate if you could reserve a conference room for today from 2-3=

ay.  Please copy everyone on this e-mail once you establish a place.

In addition, I have MHI coming in tomorrow.  I would like to reserve a confe=

I appreciate your help.

Thanks, Ron.

I would like to have a meeting today regarding the storage of MHI 501F Units=
 1 & 2.  We have received a proposal from MHI for these units to be stored i=
n Japan which is attached.  I believe we have better options if MHI persists=
 in their views on how the unit will be stored and Enron is charged for thes=

Does anytime from 1-3p work for everyone.

Copy Lorie Leigh/Lisa Zarsky on your availability and they will coordinate a=
 meeting for this afternoon.


Thanks, Ron.
