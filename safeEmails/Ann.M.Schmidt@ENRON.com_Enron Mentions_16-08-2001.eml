Jeffrey K. Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plumme=
ting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the ene=
rgy giant's chief executive officer after only about six months in the job.=20
In an interview yesterday, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his de=
cision to leave Houston-based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he ha=
d resigned for "personal reasons" unrelated to Enron's business activities.
In the interview, he reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign =
from the company's board or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's =
duties at the nation's biggest energy trader.=20
However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his "personal reasons" were deeply=
 enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during=
 his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company's stock performance a "kind of=
 ultimate score card," Mr. Skilling noted that Enron's share price had falle=
n by some 50% this year.=20
Mr. Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally. "I put a lo=
t of pressure on myself" for that decline, he said. "I felt I must not be co=
mmunicating well enough" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enr=
on's strong financial results over the past several quarters, based largely =
on growing volumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, i=
ncluding electricity, pulp and paper.=20
If the stock price had remained up "I don't think I would have felt the pres=
sure to leave," he said.=20
In January, Enron topped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite tr=
ading. It closed Tuesday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignat=
ion, at $42.93 a share. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, afte=
r falling below $37 during the day.=20
Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the depressed stock price=
 was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees, many of whom a=
re shareholders. "People would say `What is going on with the stock, Jeff?' =
I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustrating," said Mr. Skilli=
ng.=20
The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in the interview is rather differe=
nt from the widely held image of him as an ambitious, bright and thick-skinn=
ed business strategist whose long-held goal had been becoming Enron CEO. Mr.=
 Skilling said that the "final straw" in his decision to leave had come on a=
 visit last week to England in connection with the deaths of three Enron wor=
kers in a power-plant accident there. That trip helped reinforce "how tenuou=
s life is," said Mr. Skilling, who has three children from a previous marria=
ge and recently became engaged.=20
While Mr. Skilling said Enron is in "great shape," his departure raised anxi=
ety in the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance, lowered its ra=
ting on Enron to neutral from buy based on "uncertainty" created by the resi=
gnation.=20
Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name two execu=
tives to the existing "office of the chairman" within the next few days or w=
eeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom the two would be. =
The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling.

Enron's Lay to Name Two to Chairman's Office, Newspaper Reports
2001-08-16 08:41 (New York)


     Houston, Aug. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth
Lay plans to name two company executives to the ``office of the
chairman'' as soon as the next few days, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unnamed Enron spokesman.
     The appointments follow the resignation Tuesday of Jeffrey
Skilling as chief executive. Lay took back his job as CEO of the
biggest energy trader.
     Skilling had said he resigned for personal reasons. Pressure
from Enron's falling stock price also contributed to his decision,
he said in an interview with the Journal. Skilling joined Enron in
1990 and became chief executive in February.
     ``I felt I must not be communicating well enough'' with
investors, he said, according to the newspaper. Houston-based
Enron's shares had fallen 48 percent this year before Skilling
stepped down, though second-quarter profit rose 40 percent from a
year earlier, and revenue had almost tripled.
     The ``final straw,'' showing ``how tenuous life is,''
happened last week on a trip to England related to the deaths of
three Enron workers in a power-plant explosion, Skilling said in
the newspaper interview.
     Enron's stock fell $2.68, or 6.2 percent, to $40.25
yesterday.

BEA Systems hit a 52-week low as investors reacted to the downbeat forecast =

Houston-Area Energy Giant Plans to Quickly Fill CEO Position

Enron Corp. plans to move quickly to name potential successors to Jeffrey Sk=
illing, who unexpectedly stepped down Tuesday as the energy giant's chief ex=
ecutive officer and president.=20
Chairman Ken Lay took over as CEO, a role he gave up to Skilling in February=
=2E Lay is also serving as president.
Within days or weeks, Lay plans to name two Enron executives to join him in =
the office of the chairman, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Wednesday.=20
The two would get responsibilities that could give them an opportunity to be=
come president or chief executive officer "at the right time," Palmer said. =
He wouldn't speculate on who might be named.=20
Skilling surprised Wall Street with his announcement he was leaving for undi=
sclosed "personal and family reasons." His decision, he said, wasn't related=
 to Enron's business.=20
Lay stressed that Enron is in good shape, no strategic changes are planned a=
nd no problems are about to be disclosed.=20
But Skilling's resignation -- especially after just six months on a job he w=
orked a long time to get -- raised questions among analysts, who were quick =
to note Enron's closing stock price had dropped from as high as $82 at the e=
nd of January to $42.93 Tuesday. Skilling's departure was made public after =
Tuesday's market close.=20
Problems have dogged Enron, including troubles with its new broadband ventur=
e, uncertainty over its potential exposure from California's energy woes, co=
ntinued disputes over a power plant project in India, and questions about th=
e company's long-term strategy to expand from energy trading into a variety =
of other commodities.=20
Skilling's departure simply added more questions, leaving investors wonderin=
g Wednesday who might fill the void and whether other problems are lurking.=20
At one point Wednesday, Enron's stock declined to $36.87, but it gained grou=
nd by the time the market closed, ending the regular trading day down $2.68 =
at $40.25.=20
Lay, when he spoke to analysts Tuesday during a conference call, stressed th=
at Enron has plenty of experienced talent in its senior ranks. He said top e=
xecutive roles would be filled internally.=20
Names bandied about on Wall Street Wednesday as possible successors included=
 Mark Frevert, CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Lawrence "Greg" Whalley, chi=
ef operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services; and Dave Delainey, CEO of =
Enron Energy Services.=20
In his call, Lay mentioned those three but also singled out other Enron exec=
utives including Stanley Horton, Kevin Hannon, Andrew Fastow, Richard Causey=
 and Steven Kean.=20
Analysts view Enron's talent pool differently.=20
Carol Coale, with Prudential Securities in Houston, wrote in a research note=
 that she "was concerned over the depth of management at Enron," while Raymo=
nd Niles at Salomon Smith Barney, also in a research note, talked about Enro=
n's "deep bench."=20
Coale met separately with Skilling and Lay on Wednesday and said she walked =
away feeling "no new bad news" is on the way from Enron.=20
She expects Kenneth Rice, head of Enron's broadband unit, to announce his re=
signation soon but said it won't be a total surprise. Palmer declined commen=
t.=20
Two other executives resigned from Enron earlier this year.=20
The biggest question hanging over Enron is whether its move into markets suc=
h as metals and pulp and paper will prove wise, said Andre Meade, an analyst=
 with Commerzbank Securities.=20
The company's core business of wholesale trading and marketing of natural ga=
s and power of remains strong, he said.

Skilling bids farewell to Enron=20
After a tumultuous six months as the energy company's president and CEO, Jef=

Enron (NYSE: ENE), the energy and gas wholesale giant that once could do no =
wrong, released some surprisingly bad news Tuesday.=20
In a 10-Q filing, the Houston, Texas-based company reported a substantial ne=
gative cash flow in the June quarter. At the same time, it announced that pr=
esident and CEO Jeffrey Skilling had voluntarily resigned from his positions=
=2E Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board, has assumed the CEO and pres=
ident duties on an interim basis. Mr. Skilling will continue to serve as a c=
onsultant to the company and its board of directors.
Mr. Skilling's resignation, which came only six months after he assumed the =
CEO post, could be a big blow for Enron, since he was the key architect in h=
elping convert the company from a gas-pipeline business into the dominant on=
line energy trader in the industry.=20
THE POWER'S STILL ON=20
During a conference call to announce the news, Mr. Skilling said his choice =
to leave was "purely a personal decision -- it has nothing to do with Enron.=
" He also said that he "feels bad" that this move might be construed as a si=
gn of some type of negative relationship between himself and the company. Th=
ough Mr. Skilling, 47, was president and CEO for less than a year, he had be=
en with the company since 1990. By voluntarily resigning and voiding his con=
tract, which was to end in 2003, he will not receive a severance package, an=
d his "no compete" clause will be enacted through the end of that contract p=
eriod. Mr. Skilling did not return a call placed to his office.=20
One source at Enron who asked not to be named said that the general mood at =
the company is relatively sad but that Mr. Lay is a "beloved figure" and peo=
ple have confidence in his leadership skills. Mr. Lay was Enron's CEO from 1=
985 until Mr. Skilling's appointment earlier this year.=20
During the conference call, Mr. Lay said that although he regrets Mr. Skilli=
ng's decision, he has never felt better about the company. "We have the stro=
ngest and deepest talent we have ever had and our growth prospects have neve=
r been better," he stated. Mr. Lay added that he expects no changes in Enron=
's earnings outlook and that the talent in the company is so deep that any s=
lot for CEO will be filled internally. After the announcement, Enron's stock=
 dropped 6.2 percent to $40.25, a 52-week low.=20
UNDER PRESSURE?=20
The most intriguing aspect of this unexpected move is Mr. Skilling's asserti=
on that the choice was made solely for personal reasons, though during the c=
onference call he asked not to be pressed about what those reasons were. Som=
e sources suggest that the recent spate of criticism Enron has endured over =
a variety of issues might simply have been too much for Mr. Skilling to hand=
le during his brief tenure as president and CEO.=20
Recent allegations against Enron have ranged from charges of market manipula=
tion and price gouging to wielding too much influence in Washington, D.C. Th=
e price of the company's stock has dropped by more than half since this time=
 last year, and there are rumors of substantial layoffs.=20
In addition, Enron -- which has blazed a trail in energy and natural gas who=
lesaling -- has hit its first major snag: its broadband project has, up to n=
ow, been a complete failure. The Broadband Services division accounted for j=
ust 0.12 percent of the company's $50.1 billion in revenue for the second qu=
arter of 2001; that division lost $137 million before interest and taxes in =
the second quarter. In its latest 10-Q filing, the company states: "Enron is=
 significantly modifying the cost structure of Broadband Services to corresp=
ond to slower market development and the associated lower revenue outlook...=
=2E Enron expects losses to continue through at least 2001 in the Broadband =
Services segment. Future profitability is dependent on the recovery of the b=
roadband and communications sectors."=20

Stocks dropped yesterday, sending the technology-based Nasdaq composite inde=
x to its lowest level in nearly four months.=20
Sagging corporate profits again appeared to be a concern for investors. ''Pe=
ople are very cautious,'' said Rick Meckler, president of Liberty View Manag=
ement in Jersey City, ''and don't have the same willingness to bottom-fish a=
nd look out another year.''
Those who thought that the sluggish economy might have started improving by =
now, with the help of interest rate cuts, are finding that the troubles are =
proving to be longer-lasting, with companies expected to post another sharp =
decline in profits. The stock market has made little progress in the last fe=
w weeks as investors avoid buying shares until evidence of an economic turna=
round seems apparent. ''It's a wait-and-see mode,'' said Peter Coolidge of B=
rean Murray & Company in New York. ''There is just no catalyst to move stock=
s one way or another.''=20
The Nasdaq index fell 45.64 points, or 2.32 percent, to 1,918.89 -- its lowe=
st close since April 16. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average declined=
 less steeply, falling 66.22 points, or 0.64 percent, to 10,345.95. The broa=

1,178.02. Market breadth was slightly positive on the New York Stock Exchang=

35. Volume was 1.07 million shares.=20
Hewlett-Packard was one stock leading the Dow lower. It declined 76 cents, t=
o close at $24.10, ahead of an earnings report due after the end of trading =
today.=20
Dell Computer fell $1.07, to $25.50, also ahead of its earnings announcement=
 today. Credit Suisse First Boston, citing tough industry conditions, trimme=
d its 2002 earnings projection for Dell by 2.8 percent and cut its 2003 esti=
mates 10 percent.=20
Veritas Software fell $3.04, to $34.40, after Morgan Stanley analysts raised=
 questions about the performance of some of the company's products. BEA Syst=
ems, the electronic commerce software maker, dropped $1.56, to $17.04. The c=
ompany said that quarterly earnings met estimates, but it lowered its outloo=
k for the rest of the year, noting the softness in the economy.=20
Applied Materials, the semiconductor-equipment maker, rose 9 cents, to $43.7=
4. It reported quarterly net income down more than 90 percent, yet still sur=
passed its target of breaking even in the badly slumping chip industry. Appl=
ied Materials said orders would remain weak in the fourth quarter, but be in=
 line with those in the third quarter. Sales are expected to be flat, but th=
e company said it expected a profit.=20
Advanced Micro Devices fell 75 cents, to $14.75, after losing $1.11 on Tuesd=
ay. I.B.M. said it has stopped selling desktop PC's in the United States wit=

Metromedia Fiber Network, of White Plains, fell 44 cents, to 70 cents. The c=
ompany, which builds high-speed fiber optic communications networks in citie=

Among energy providers, Enron fell $2.68, to $40.25, on the news of Jeffrey =

Skilling quits, jolts Enron

WASHINGTON: Enron Corporation, the American energy giant whose Dabhol power =
plant in India has been in the eye of a storm over the past decade, suffered=
 a stunning corporate loss on Monday when its Chief Executive Jeff Skilling =
resigned after only six months in the job.=20
The news jolted the energy industry and Wall Street, sending the heavyweight=
 stock, which has already fallen more than 50 per cent over the past year du=
e to multiple setbacks, further down. Enron's paternalist chairman, the 59-y=
ear old Kenneth Lay, who had recruited Skilling, will return to the post he =
had held for 15 years.
The 47-year old Skilling, who was an energy consultant at McKinsey when Lay =
hired him, was considered something of whiz in the sector. He aggressively l=
ed Enron's transformation from an old-line natural gas pipeline company to a=
 commodity trader in energy and bandwidth.=20
But the makeover was accompanied by a plethora of setbacks, including the co=
ntroversy over the Dabhol plant and the energy crisis in California. The com=
pany also attracted widespread opprobrium from many other parts of the world=
 over the way it operated. As a result, Enron's stock, which reached a high =
of $90 last August, trades at less than half of that today.=20
Skilling told the media that his reasons for leaving are "strictly personal =
and he'd just as soon keep it private," something CEO-return Lay confirmed. =
There are "absolutely no accounting issue, no trading issue, no reserve issu=
e, no previously unknown problem issues" behind the departure, Lay said.=20
Lay, who is a Republican Party heavyweight and could just as well have been =
the Energy Secretary in the Bush administration had he wanted the job, said =
he would remain as CEO till 2005, "to make sure we have plenty of time to wo=
rk out an orderly succession."=20
Skilling's exit comes on the heels of several other departures from the comp=
any over the past year, including that of Rebecca Mark, its high-profile exe=
cutive who initiated the Dabhol plant and her successor Joseph Sutton. The c=
ompany also recently lost Sanjay Bhatnagar, who was associated with the Dabh=
ol plant since its inception and was its managing director.=20
Rebecca Mark was washed up after Azurix Corporation, Enron's global water bu=
siness that she was put in charge of, floundered. Bhatnagar was shifted to S=
ingapore to handle Enron's broadband business but resigned his job in Januar=
y this year "to pursue other interests."

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. stock plunged to a 52-week low Wednesday as Wall Str=
eet reacted to Tuesday's surprise resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, chief =
executive of the energy-trading giant and one of the main architects of its =
bold business strategy.=20
That strategy--shedding physical assets to become a high-tech middleman for =
goods as diverse as crude oil and fiber-optic broadband--has increasingly co=
me into question as Enron's stock value has been sliced in half since Skilli=
ng took over the helm in February.
Still, several analysts kept the faith Wednesday. Goldman, Sachs & Co., Banc=
 of America Securities and Bear Stearns all reaffirmed their positive rating=
s on Enron stock.=20
Even an analyst who downgraded the shares said he was doing so more because =
of the uncertainty surrounding Skilling's exit than doubts about Enron's bus=
iness direction.=20
Skilling, 47, called his reasons for resigning "purely personal" and family =
related. He will continue as a part-time consultant while his mentor and pre=
decessor, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, takes back the CEO post he had held=
 for 15 years.=20
After touching a 52-week low of $36.87 on the New York Stock Exchange early =
in Wednesday's session, Enron shares recovered to close at $40.25, down $2.6=
8. Trading volume was huge, with more than 29 million shares changing hands-=
-eight times the daily average for Enron.=20
Donato J. Eassey, a Merrill Lynch analyst based in Enron's home town of Hous=
ton, cut his short-term outlook on the stock from to "neutral" from "buy" an=
d dropped his long-term rating to "accumulate" from "buy."=20
Enron tends to trade at more than 20 times per-share earnings, Eassey noted,=
 while its competitors have price-to-earnings ratios of around 16. Enron's P=
/E premium could melt away "as this new uncertainty brings into question its=
 sustainable growth outlook," Eassey said in a report issued Wednesday.=20
The analyst stuck by his earnings estimates for Enron, however, noting that =
its core energy-wholesaling business is healthy. "It is the noise surroundin=
g its other investments that will once again test Mr. Lay's ability to right=
 the ship," he said.=20
Part of the "noise" Eassey referred to is being made in California, where of=
ficials have accused Enron of profiteering during the state's electricity cr=
isis by manipulating energy prices.=20
Skilling, in an interview last month with the Associated Press, rejected the=
 accusation in typically combative fashion.=20
"If we were involved in creating the kind of price volatility that occurred =
in California, then we are the stupidest people in the world," Skilling said=
=2E "It has hammered our stock price and it has probably in some ways create=
d a resistance to additional liberation of markets, which is what we built o=
ur entire business on."=20
Indeed, if Enron's aggressiveness in California contributed to a climate of =
caution toward electric-utility deregulation in other states, it could be a =
major blow to the company's business plan, analysts said.

USA: Enron reels as heir-apparent Skilling exits.
By C. Bryson Hull

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Jeff Skilling's bombshell resignation as preside=
nt and chief executive of Enron Corp. just six months after taking the job s=
ent the energy giant's stock tumbling on Wednesday and left Wall Street wond=
ering who would replace him.=20
Skilling, 47, was long considered the heir apparent to Chairman Kenneth Lay,=
 who will reassume the CEO duties he handed to Skilling in February. Lay, 59=
, said he had signed on through 2005 in order to have time to prepare a succ=
essor.
But the stock market immediately made it clear that Wall Street was not in f=
avor of the departure. Enron dropped to a 19-month low, shedding 6.2 percent=
 or $2.68 to close at $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading=
=2E=20
Seeking to assuage concerns that Enron would have a clear executive successi=
on plan, Lay told analysts Wednesday that he would search for his successor =
from a still-deep talent pool inside Enron.=20
Grooming and promoting from the inside is almost a necessity given the compa=
ny's entrepreneurial culture which encourages employees to create new busine=
ss ideas and rewards those who succeed with promotions and greater responsib=
ilities.=20
"There is a lot of talent within Enron, and they have a deep bench of these =
people," Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles said.=20
Lay mentioned Mark Frevert, head of Enron's core wholesale energy trading an=
d marketing segment, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and Chief Account=
ing Officer Richard Causey, and Executive Vice President Steve Kean as evide=
nce of Enron's management strength.=20
With Skilling suddenly gone, Lay quickly acted to assuage investors that Enr=
on would stay its course under his renewed watch. His return to full command=
 was the logical choice, analysts said.=20
"I think it is very reassuring. He is the architect of the company, the one =
who took it from an intrastate pipeline company to a worldwide energy compan=
y. There is probably no one more qualified," UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone =
said.=20
STEPPED OR PUSHED?=20
Skilling and Lay both maintain the resignation was a purely personal decisio=
n and not related to Enron's recent, persistent stock weakness and string of=
 high-profile stumbles.=20
The Harvard Business School graduate suffered a bumpy ride during his short =
tenure in the No. 2 slot, where he was more often in the spotlight than the =
boss he took over from Feb. 12. And it was rarely pleasant.=20
Skilling took persistent battering over the poor performance of Enron's broa=
dband business, a costly payment fight with the Indian government over the $=
3 billion Dabhol power plant and the breakup of a marquee video on-demand br=
oadband Internet deal with Blockbuster Inc. .=20
California politicians also blamed Enron and others for causing their power =
crisis, and that culminated with a protester throwing a pie in Skilling's fa=
ce while he gave a speech in San Francisco.=20
Analysts were mixed on whether they believed Skilling was leaving for person=
al reasons, and not because of the recent woes that marked his tenure. Some =
suggested that the problems created increasing pressure and incredibly long =
time demands on Skilling.=20
"I think the guy just said 'I've got more money than I can spend, I'm outta =
here,'" Barone said.=20
One analyst who asked not to be identified said Skilling's identification wi=
th the limping broadband business may have led the board to ask him to leave=
=2E=20
Niles said there was nothing good about Skilling's exit, because it leaves E=
nron without one of the key players in its emergence.=20
"I think Skilling is their principal visionary, so he will be missed," he sa=

Bandwidth Market: Price For OC48 Package Shifts Downward

08/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- The price for OC48 capacity on three routes shifted do=
wnward Wednesday in the bandwidth market, but no trades were done.=20
The OC48 contracts are for bandwidth between New York and Los Angeles, New Y=
ork and Miami, and Seattle and Los Angeles for calendar year 2003.
The price on all three routes as a package now is $0.00015-$0.000165 a DS0 m=
ile a month.=20
The previous quote for an OC48 for calendar year 2003 on the New York-Los An=
geles route had been $0.00016-$0.00019/DS0 mile/month. But that contract is =
no longer being quoted, a trader said Wednesday.=20
A contract for OC48 for calendar year 2003 on the Seattle-Los Angeles route =
last traded Aug. 1 at $0.000175/DS0 mile/month as part of a similar three-ro=
ute package.=20
A contract for OC48 capacity for 2003 on the New York-Miami route last trade=
d Aug. 2 at $0.00016/DS0 mile/month. That represents a decline of $0.00001 o=
n the offer price.=20
Traders and brokers also spent much of the day discussing the surprise depar=
ture of Jeffrey Skilling as president and chief executive of Enron Corp. (EN=
E). Skilling was an early proponent of bandwidth trading.=20
Although Skilling and the company said he was leaving for personal reasons, =
some wondered whether Enron's declining share price was the reason for the d=
eparture. In the last year, Enron shares had traded as high as $90.75 and as=
 low as $42. But word of Skilling's departure sent the share price as low as=
 $36.87 Wednesday, before it closed at $40.24 for the day.=20
"I kind of believe what (Skilling) said," one broker said. "The guy helped b=
uild the company, you'd think the board would stick with him if he wanted to=
 stay."=20

Enron's CEO Skilling Departs, Testing Enron Again
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

08/15/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The sudden departure of Enron Corp. (ENE) President a=
nd Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling after six months on the job has provided=
 yet another blow to the company's ailing stock price.=20
Skilling is departing for undisclosed personal reasons, and his predecessor,=
 Kenneth Lay, will replace him. Lay, who is currently chairman, has extended=
 his employment contract by two years through 2005, and will look to mold th=
e next level of succession.
Wall Street once marveled at Enron, the small Texas gas pipeline operator th=
at seized the opportunities presented by deregulating energy markets to rein=
vent itself as the world's largest energy trading company.=20
But more recently, Enron has been under fire, and its stock price, which has=
 been more than halved since the start of the year, reflects that.=20
"I think right now what you have is this panicked knee-jerked reaction," sai=
d UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, commenting on the decline in Enron's st=
ock price Wednesday. Enron shares set a 52-week low of $36.87 intraday, and =
closed at $40, down $2.93, or 6.8%.=20
Barone, who met earlier Wednesday with executives as part of a previously sc=
heduled meeting between UBS Warburg clients and Enron management, said he ex=
pects Enron stock will recover once "the dust settles," and investors begin =
to see Enron continue to move its strategy forward.=20
"I don't think there is a need for any major tinkering," Barone said.=20
Analysts expect to see Enron continue to reduce its international exposure, =
look to stem losses at its broadband division and more clearly communicate h=
ow it plans to continue to achieve sustainable profit growth.=20
Departure Has Psychological Impact=20

Still, Skilling's departure has had a psychological impact because he was se=
en as a key architect of the company's transformation.=20
Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant, started working with Lay and Enron in=
 the late 1980s as the company was began its evolution to compete in the new=
ly deregulated natural gas market.=20
He later joined Enron in 1990, and served as chairman and chief executive of=
 Enron North America Corp. and its predecessor companies from 1991 to 1996, =
before being named president and chief operating officer.=20
J. Michael Walker, an Enron employee for 25 years, reported to Skilling in t=
he mid-1990s. Walker, now a senior manager at CapGemini Ernst & Young, said =
investors have doubts about whether Enron can sustain its current earnings g=
rowth.=20
"Very few investors understand they are the company that makes markets," Wal=
ker said. "The market cannot function without Enron."=20
Walker expects investors will only be persuaded when they see the company co=
ntinue to report strong earnings growth.=20

The timing of the resignation also factored into the market's reaction to th=
e news because the announcement came as the news flow had begun to turn in E=
nron's favor, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.=20
Feygin cited the progress Enron is making in India as an example. Enron owns=
 a controlling stake in the Dabhol Power Co., which operates a power plant t=
hat halted generating electricity in late May after the state-controlled pow=
er board, the plant's sole customer, stopped making payments for the power i=
t purchased. After months of frustration and political wrangling, progress i=
s being made. The Indian Supreme Court has handed down a favorable ruling, a=
nd federal ministers have agreed to a power bill that will reform the entire=
 sector.=20
Enron also continues to divest itself of non-core assets. Recently, the comp=
any sold its 50% stake in a power plant in Puerto Rico and the North America=
n water business of its Azurix unit.=20
However, some had been critical of the sales process because it was taking t=
he company longer than expected to sell some of its non-core assets because =
of a weak global market.=20
Feygin said Skilling may have made the mistake trying to implement the dives=
titure plan too quickly.=20
Analysts see the sale of these assets as an essential part of Enron's strate=
gy to focus more on its information-based and logistics businesses.=20
In addition, the pressure caused by the California power crisis has eased. E=
nron was one of the companies selling power to the state's financially troub=
led utilities when power prices skyrocketed to record heights. As a result, =
Enron shares often were pressured whenever political rhetoric turned against=
 power generators and traders in the Western market.=20

Joseph Correnti, of Wayne Hummer Investments, said the news of Skilling's re=
signation gave some investors another reason to sell the company's shares.=20
"The factors are more perception than reality," he said.=20
Correnti was reassured by the decision of Enron's Lay to replace Skilling be=
cause he is a known factor.=20
Now, market watchers are focusing on getting to know others at the company w=
ho are considered to be among the company's rising stars.=20
Lay cited, among others, Mark Frevert, chairman of Enron's wholesale trading=
 business; Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer; and Richard Cause=
y, the company's chief accounting officer; as potential candidates for secon=
d-in-command.=20
CapGemini's Walker said Enron's talent runs deep. He cited Greg Whalley, pre=
sident and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services, as another e=
xample of an individual who can help Enron grow its market.=20
Still, the questions about Skilling's resignation will persist for near term=
=2E Those questions gained fuel from the departures several executive over t=
he past year, including Clifford Baxter, Joe Sutton and Tom White, who all s=
erved as former vice chairmen at the company and Lou Pai, the former chief e=
xecutive of Enron Energy Services.=20
In downgrading the near-term rating of Enron stock Wednesday to neutral, Mer=
rill Lynch's Donato Eassey said it will take a while for the news of Skillin=
g's resignation to "shake out, and for a new catalyst to take shape."=20

Buried treasure?=20
Historic status for pipelines resisted=20
By JEFF BLISS=20
Bloomberg Business News=20
WASHINGTON -- Duke Energy Corp. set out to replace a 30-mile stretch of natu=
ral-gas pipeline in Pennsylvania and ended up underwriting a $350,000 histor=
y lesson.=20
State officials, using a federal preservation law, recommended that the pipe=
line, known as Big Inch, be considered a historic site, because it was used =
to supply oil to the U.S. military in World War II. To get approval, Duke ag=
reed to produce a video and booklet that documented the building of the pipe=
line, whose 1,476-mile length snakes from Texas to New Jersey.=20
That was five years ago, and today what happened to Duke is becoming more co=
mmonplace. Pipelines owned by El Paso and Enron Corp. in states ranging from=
 Arizona to Iowa to Pennsylvania have been recommended for historic status, =
adding costs and delays to attempts to replace or upgrade them.=20
"This is silly," said Martin Edwards, a lobbyist for the Interstate Natural =
Gas Association of America. "These are buried natural gas pipelines."=20
The companies' complaints have caught the ear of the Bush administration and=
 members of Congress. When the House passed an energy bill this summer, it i=
ncluded a provision to exempt many pipelines from the historic-preservation =
process. The Senate is considering a similar measure.=20
Historians and state preservation officials say there is nothing silly about=
 the debate over what they regard as buried treasure.=20
Large-diameter natural-gas pipelines began spreading across the American lan=
dscape in the 1930s through the 1950s. They brought a cleaner, more efficien=
t alternative to the gas produced by coal that most pollution-choked cities =
and towns were using.=20
The pipelines "changed a lot of people's way of living," said Lowell Soike, =
the deputy state historic officer for Iowa.=20
Without the force of federal preservation laws, companies won't be compelled=
 to document their pipelines, said Christopher Castaneda, an associate profe=
ssor of history at California State University-Sacramento.=20
The House provision also may prompt exemptions for other structures, leading=
 to a loss of a wealth of historical information, Castaneda said.=20
"This might be a dangerous precedent," he said.=20
When Duke set out to replace its Pennsylvania pipeline, it sent a routine no=
tice of its plans to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency th=
at oversees interstate pipelines.=20
When Pennsylvania officials expressed interest in Big Inch, FERC launched a =
review to ensure Duke preserved the site's history to the state's satisfacti=
on.=20
Duke executives say they didn't protest when told of their pipeline's new st=
atus. "We got used to doing what it takes" to get projects approved, said Jo=
hn Pepper, a Duke executive who oversees compliance with federal laws.=20
Duke began compiling research for a booklet and shot the video on the Big In=
ch and companion Little Inch. The pipelines got their names from the 24-inch=
 and 20-inch diameter segments used in their construction.=20
In the video, designed for fifth-graders and sixth-graders, a fictional char=
acter named "Professor Bob" describes how German U-boats roamed the Atlantic=
 seaboard early in World War II and sank U.S. oil tankers at will.=20
The federal government and a coalition of companies that included the former=
 Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Shell Oil Co. and Gulf Oil Co. conceive=
d an overland route to avoid the submarine attacks. Big Inch would carry oil=
, and Little Inch would transport kerosene and other petroleum products.=20
Men like "Wedgehead" Madden and "Hard Times" Schwartz laid 1,476 miles of pi=
pe over a route that cut through the mountains, rivers and marshlands in jus=
t 350 days to complete Big Inch in 1943. Workers finished the final weld on =
Little Inch the next year. The pipelines were the longest and heaviest const=
ructed at the time.=20
Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., a unit of Duke, converted the Big Inch pip=
eline to natural gas after purchasing it from the government in 1947. The co=
mpany turned over operation of Little Inch to the Texas Eastern Products Pip=
eline Co.=20
The Big Inch story illustrates why a buried pipeline's legacy should be docu=
mented, historians and preservation officials said. Communities often mark u=
nseen history, placing plaques where houses stood and trails meandered.=20
"Just because it's not a physical manifestation we can see, I don't agree th=
ere's no history," Castaneda said.=20

Enron plans to quickly fill top positions=20

Enron Corp. plans to move quickly to name potential successors to Jeffrey Sk=
illing, who unexpectedly stepped down Tuesday as the energy giant's chief ex=
ecutive officer and president.=20
Chairman Ken Lay took over as CEO, a role he gave up to Skilling in February=
=2E Lay is also serving as president.=20
Within days or weeks, Lay plans to name two Enron executives to join him in =
the office of the chairman, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Wednesday.=20
The two would get responsibilities that could give them an opportunity to be=
come president or chief executive officer "at the right time," Palmer said. =
He wouldn't speculate on who might be named.=20
Skilling surprised Wall Street with his announcement he was leaving for undi=
sclosed "personal and family reasons." His decision, he said, wasn't related=
 to Enron's business.=20
Lay stressed that Enron is in good shape, no strategic changes are planned a=
nd no problems are about to be disclosed.=20
But Skilling's resignation -- especially after just six months on a job he w=
orked a long time to get -- raised questions among analysts, who were quick =
to note Enron's closing stock price had dropped from as high as $82 at the e=
nd of January to $42.93 Tuesday. Skilling's departure was made public after =
Tuesday's market close.=20
Problems have dogged Enron, including troubles with its new broadband ventur=
e, uncertainty over its potential exposure from California's energy woes, co=
ntinued disputes over a power plant project in India, and questions about th=
e company's long-term strategy to expand from energy trading into a variety =
of other commodities.=20
Skilling's departure simply added more questions, leaving investors wonderin=
g Wednesday who might fill the void and whether other problems are lurking.=20
At one point Wednesday, Enron's stock declined to $36.87, but it gained grou=
nd by the time the market closed, ending the regular trading day down $2.68 =
at $40.25.=20
Lay, when he spoke to analysts Tuesday during a conference call, stressed th=
at Enron has plenty of experienced talent in its senior ranks. He said top e=
xecutive roles would be filled internally.=20
Names bandied about on Wall Street Wednesday as possible successors included=
 Mark Frevert, CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Lawrence "Greg" Whalley, chi=
ef operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services; and Dave Delainey, CEO of =
Enron Energy Services.=20
In his call, Lay mentioned those three but also singled out other Enron exec=
utives including Stanley Horton, Kevin Hannon, Andrew Fastow, Richard Causey=
 and Steven Kean.=20
Analysts give differing views of Enron's talent pool.=20
Carol Coale, with Prudential Securities in Houston, wrote in a research note=
 that she was "concerned over the depth of management at Enron," while Raymo=
nd Niles at Salomon Smith Barney, also in a research note, talked about Enro=
n's "deep bench."=20
Coale met separately with Skilling and Lay on Wednesday and said she walked =
away feeling "no new bad news" is on the way from Enron.=20
She expects Kenneth Rice, head of Enron's broadband unit, to announce his re=
signation soon but said it won't be a total surprise. Palmer declined commen=
t.=20
Two other executives left Enron earlier this year.=20
The biggest question hanging over Enron is whether its move into markets suc=
h as metals and pulp and paper will prove wise, said Andre Meade, an analyst=
 with Commerzbank Securities.=20
The company's core business of wholesale trading and marketing of natural ga=

CHINA: ANALYSIS-India investors seen gaining from U.S. policy shift.

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investors in India are set to reap the benefit=
s of a shift in U.S. foreign policy that will urge faster progress on econom=
ic reform to provide Washington with a strategic counterbalance to China in =
Asia.=20
Ratings agencies and the IMF have both broadsided India in the past week ove=
r a poor economic performance and its stumbling decade-long reform effort. B=
ut a $540 million trade concession from Washington, and reassurances that sa=
nctions against New Dehli will be scrapped, are signs of better times ahead.
Investors hope keener U.S. interest in India could lead to a dynamic similar=
 to that in China, which under constant prodding from Washington the past th=
ree decades has become a money magnet. China won 80 percent of Asia's foreig=
n direct investment last year and has been a portfolio investor's haven in 2=
001.=20
"The Bush administration is pretty determined to improve relations with Indi=
a and improve its economic performance," Andrew Ballingal, director of globa=
l asset allocation at TAL CEF Asset Management, told Reuters.=20
"It's always sensible when considering strategic partners to make sure their=
 economy works," he said.=20
Fresh support from India's single biggest trading partner - analysts say Ind=
ian exports to the U.S. top $9 billion and two-way trade is around $14 billi=
on - could not be better timed.=20
Export growth slumped to just 1.76 percent year on year in India's April-Jun=
e first quarter, while imports fell 2.4 percent. Industrial growth recorded =
a dismal 1.9 percent year on year in May and overall GDP growth sank to 5.2 =
percent in 2000/01 from 6.4 and 6.6 percent in the previous two years.=20
POLARISED PERFORMANCE=20
Foreign fund investments in India's equity and debt had shrunk to $91 millio=
n in July from $900 million in January and the benchmark Bombay stock index =
has lost 16 percent, or $8.5 billion of its value this year.=20
This comes while China's hard currency B-share markets have roughly doubled =
in value this year and its economy has defied the global slowdown with expor=
ts up 27.8 percent year on year in 2000 and annual GDP growth seen at about =
eight percent to 2003.=20
The polarised performance is underscored by foreign direct investment (FDI).=
 China snared $40.8 billion worth in 2000 compared to $2.6 billion spent in =
India, which has attracted just $23.6 billion over the course of 10 years of=
 economic reform.=20
But analysts say India stands to win as President George W. Bush draws a fir=
m line between political and economic relations to counter the strategic gai=
ns China will reap from a U.S. policy of engagement to bring Beijing into th=
e global trade system.=20
"Trade between nations and commerce is good for the U.S. interest in general=
=2E.. if you trade you're less likely to fight," said Gene Galbraith, chief =
executive at analysts Asiawise.=20
"But the pressure is on Bush from certain factions in the Republican party t=
o be more firm on China," he said. "Bush is playing the India card against C=
hina in part... and America's views of India are changing rather rapidly for=
 the good."=20
Rather than being a passive pawn on the foreign policy board, investors say =
New Delhi should seek to capitalise on a shift in U.S. strategy to resolve r=
eform fatigue.=20
LUMBERING ELEPHANT=20
"India has had the great misfortune to take British 1940s socialism and perf=
ect it," Ballingal said.=20
"India really is more of a lumbering elephant to China's leaping tiger, but =
people are too pessimistic about India. Things have improved over the past f=
ive or six years," he said.=20
Advocates of India's potential say its burgeoning software industry - a glob=
al leader - large English-speaking middle class, huge one billion-strong pop=
ulation, accounting and legal infrastructure and its democracy underpin thei=
r faith.=20
"China has been incentivised to kick-start reforms because of the WTO and th=
e Olympics. The reason I'd put China ahead of India at the moment is because=
 reform is already happening," Robert Penaloza, a fund manager at Aberdeen A=
sset Management said.=20
"But just because things are not there it doesn't mean they can't be, so the=

Enron's Former CEO Says He Failed in Some Businesses, CNBC Says
2001-08-15 19:55 (New York)


     Houston, Aug. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s former Chief
Executive Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned yesterday, said he
decided to leave the energy-trading company after feeling ``he had
failed in crucial business areas,'' financial news network CNBC
reported, citing the Wall Street Journal.

     Skilling quit just six months after he took the job, CNBC
reported. Skilling, who said he left for personal and family
reasons, is the third top executive to leave Enron in the past
year.

     Skilling, who joined Enron in 1990, said yesterday that the
company is sound, and that his reasons for quitting were strictly
personal and would be kept private.

     Many investors give Skilling much of the credit for
transforming Houston-based Enron from a slow-growth operator of
natural-gas pipelines into the second-biggest U.S. energy company
after ExxonMobil Corp. Enron's shares fell $2.68 to $40.25 today.
