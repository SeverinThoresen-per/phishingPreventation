	Sue, we have looked at an automated way to take care of this issue.  So far=
 we have not
	found an exceptable change.   It is a timing issue with true ups from the p=
revious day
	which are not completed before the current day calcuations are done.  It is=
 an item we=20
	are manually monitoring today, but we are continuing to look for a better m=
ethod.
	Thanks.  Lynn=20

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been wor=
king with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler=
, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the ov=
er scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FD=
D is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balan=
ces.

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is a=
lso included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allo=
wable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for =
GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance=
 for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1=
st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, o=
ver the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end o=
f December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  T=
his was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,40=
6 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-St=
ep - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.
