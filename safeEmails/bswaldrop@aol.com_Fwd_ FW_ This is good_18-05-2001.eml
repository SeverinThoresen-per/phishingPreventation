> One night a police officer was stalking out a particularly rowdy bar for
> possible violations of the driving under the influence laws.  At closing
> time, he saw a fellow stumble out of the bar, trip on the curb and try his
> keys on five different cars before he found his.
> Then, he sat in the front seat fumbling around with his keys for several
> minutes.
> Everyone left the bar and drove off.  Finally, he started his engine and
> began to pull away.
> The police officer was waiting for him.  He stopped the driver, read him
> his rights, and administered the Breathalyzer Test.
> The results showed a reading of 0.0.  The puzzled officer demanded to know
> how that could be.  The driver replied, "tonight, I'm the 'Designated
> Decoy'."
