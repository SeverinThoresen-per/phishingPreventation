We will receive the $2 million when AES and TVA execute an interconnection a=
greement for AES' Haywood project. While it is possible that this agreement =
will be executed this month (50%), it's equally as likely that it will happe=
n Q4. AES is currently under construction on their Haywood project, and as s=
uch, they need to get this agreement wrapped up ASAP. Our role in this is to=
 utilize our resources (primarily our consultant who is a former TVA Directo=
r) to help AES through the process (and in doing so, we will receive our ups=
ide payment of $2 million). We are doing everything we can to reach this mil=
estone in Q3.

We can talk about this before our conference call if you like.=20

Regards,

Ben
