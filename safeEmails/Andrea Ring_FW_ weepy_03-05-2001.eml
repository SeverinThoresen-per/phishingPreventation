> Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat.

> The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward

> The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the

> Everyone started yelling, "Shay, run to first. Run to first." Never in his

By

e.
>
> As Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him
> in the direction of third base, and shouted, "Run to third!"  As Shay
> rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, "Shay! Run home!"
>
> Shay ran home, stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero, for
> hitting a "grand slam" and winning the game for his team.
>
> "That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,"t=
he
