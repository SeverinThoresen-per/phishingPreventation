Andy,
Mark Greenberg, myself and the attorney for TFS are working out the details =
for the definitive agreement.  The revised copy was sent out this afternoon.=
  If all goes well, it should close next week.  There are a few issues that =
could delay it but the chances of that happening are low.

TradeSpark was eager to see a contract.  I had an agreement sent out yesterd=
ay to Michael Williams that included North American Natural Gas, Power, Coal=
, Emissions, Broadband and Weather for $500,000.  Of course, Michael wanted =
to discuss putting the prices on TradeSpark.  I told him that the contract w=
ill only deal with the ability to transact on behalf of his clients.  Hopefu=
lly, we can leave it there but I doubt that's the last we'll hear of it.

-Dan
