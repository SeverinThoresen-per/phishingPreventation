Andy and Michelle:  I am  still waiting to hear from Ann Murray (at LeBoeuf =
Lamb) about the results of the  "410(b) test" for the GSP pension plan.  (If=
 the plan cannot pass that  test, it cannot be maintained in the Enron contr=
olled group as drafted.)  I  called Ann again yesterday, and she is out of t=
own until Tuesday, although she  left a message that the actuary should have=
 the results of the test when she  gets back.  I am holding up the letter to=
 Media General and the notice to  the trustee until I hear from Ann that all=
 is ok.  If the test is not  passed, there are several alternatives, but I d=
o not want to direct the trustee  to send the assets to the GSP plan until w=
e are sure that it is the plan  that will receive the Media General assets. =
 I will let you know as soon as  I get word from Ann.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions in the  meantime.  Dusty Burke.
