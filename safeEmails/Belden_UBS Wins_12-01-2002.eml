John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, =
UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North Americ=
a Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or =
are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Credit=
ors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on=
 this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge o=
n Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the nex=
t couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...
