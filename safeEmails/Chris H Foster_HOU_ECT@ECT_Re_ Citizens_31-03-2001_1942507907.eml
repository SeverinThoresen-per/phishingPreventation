Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as =
you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we=
 have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at =
the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still=
 leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could boo=
k it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as wel=
