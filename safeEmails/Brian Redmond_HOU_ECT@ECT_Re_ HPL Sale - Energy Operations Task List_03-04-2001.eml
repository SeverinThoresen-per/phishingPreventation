Sally,

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think we'=
ve sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on feedback=
 from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet as to wh=
at is required.

Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops "=
process" or function:

1.	Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after clo=
se.
2.	How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP.
3.	The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionalit=
y in place (and who is responsible for implementing this).=09

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves=
 closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a =
description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you lis=
ted on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what the=
y are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a me=
mo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other. =20

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the o=
ther part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob H=
all/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron)=
 understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting =
to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome=
 to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each=
 Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops ma=
tters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.   =20

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's=
 origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of =
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. =
 Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protoco=
l" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is=
 not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions sim=
ply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of inf=
ormation, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Op=
erational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exac=
tly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to=
 Steve Jackson (AEP). =20

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally do=
cumented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the origina=
l Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to=
 be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury grou=
p to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in L=
egal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendm=
ent to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that =
amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury=
 group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment =
to AEP for their review before final signatures. =20

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition i=
ssues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of yo=
u.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to=
 date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require act=
ions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we wil=
l update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list o=
r which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we =
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or=
 memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your=
 requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update yo=
u weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and A=
EP. =20

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update=
 on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I sugge=
st that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:=20

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so=
 that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and t=
heir status, or=20

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a fir=
sthand update to the two of you. =20

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can inco=
rporate that into our schedules for next week. =20
