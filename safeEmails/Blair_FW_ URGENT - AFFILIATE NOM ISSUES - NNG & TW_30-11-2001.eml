Craig there is no old or new business on New Power at this time on the contr=
acts listed below.

NNG's Bear Paw contracts 102518 and 104442 has a nomination every month and =
predict one for Dec.

NNG's Enovate contracts have no old or new business at this time.

I just got off the phone Paul Cherry and there is an exposure issue with 3 a=
ffiliate shippers: Bear Paw, Enovate and The New Power Company.  Please chec=
k with the schedulers (if any) and determine if these contacts have been pre=
viously nominated upon.  Also, it is important that, if they nominate from t=
his date forward, the activity is approved through Paul Cherry (may require =
pre-payment).  Thanks
