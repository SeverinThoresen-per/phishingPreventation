	jim,

	the records group was assisting carolyn gilley and her contractor with this=
 project.  answering questions/retrieving 	boxes/research/etc.  we do not kn=
ow where her contractor left off with the project, but would be more than ha=
ppy to 	provide a group to complete the project for AEP.  the enron records =
department handles information for all enron 	companies.  this would elimina=
te the learning curve if a new group were brought in.   i had asked mark tho=
rne about 	the status of this project when i learned carolyn and her contrac=
tor had left.

	please let me know who i need to talk to regarding completion of this proje=
ct.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyon=
e knows anything. =20

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of co=
nference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are a=
pproxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong t=
o AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information =
that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gil=
ley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and re=
moving the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to =
us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs f=
or the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team o=
f contractors to complete this.

	jim,

	thanks so much for taking the time to reply.   the boxes were sent to bert =
stromquist from linda lyrock (EGEP, Inc.).  	i am not sure about the labelin=
g of the boxes (HPL).  the boxes contain technical data for expl & prod for =
	international areas. =20

	bert was with enron global markets.  any ideas regarding these records will=
 be helpful.

	thanks,

No.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl=
 Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.  Can we get more s=
pecific information as to the contents and whether they are labled as HPL or=
 not?
