Subject: displaying 4 digit year on your desktop

In case you were not aware, you have the ability to control the Date display=
=20
format on your PC.  As we approach year 2000, you may wish to see all four=20
digits of the year to insure that when you enter '00', the system recognizes=
=20
it as 2000 vs. 1900.  Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to=20
view these 2 additional digits.  To do this, go to:

Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style. =20
You may want to change it from "mm/dd/yy" to "mm/dd/yyyy" then hit OK.

The screen print below may be helpful.  Please forward to others in your are=
a=20
that may be interested.  Thanks, d.n.
