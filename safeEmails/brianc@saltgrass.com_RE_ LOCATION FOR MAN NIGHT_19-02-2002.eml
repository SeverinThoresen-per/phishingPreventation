 accident...or are you OK?

Fishing Report from Plaag outing on Friday...

22 trout...no giant ones, but good solid spring time fish.
All caught on Corkies and Topwaters in the far end of East Bay down by Rollo=
ver. Biggest fish was 24", and the rest were 19" to 23". "Shoulda been here =
yesterday"...Plaag had a bunch of REALLY big fish located over deep mud/shel=
l out in the middle of the bay that they caught the day before on a really l=
ow tide. Friday, the tide was up over a foot from the day before and "the sp=
ot" was too deep to fish!!! They caught some ridiculous number like 5 fish o=
ver 7 lbs and the rest over 5 lbs on Thursday. Oh well...damn fun trip anywa=
y.  Those winter time fish are just plain bigger and stronger than a surf ru=
n trout. And they are a lot darker colored...tails almost black. Pretty cool=
 looking stringers!!!
