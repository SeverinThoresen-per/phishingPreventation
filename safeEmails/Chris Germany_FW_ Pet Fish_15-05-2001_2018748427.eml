A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with
two
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game
warden
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.

"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home."

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"

The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,
I'll
show you. It really works."

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well?"

"Well, What?" the man responded.

"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

"Call who back?" The man asked.

"The fish." replied the warden.

"What fish?" The man asked.
