Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which aff=
ected the following deals:

275298	Jan-00			modified option premium
288187		Feb-00			modified option premium
300368	Mar-00			modified option premium
316345		Apr-00			modified option premium
331019		May-00			modified option premium
347153		Jun-00			modified option premium
425790	Dec-00 through Feb-01 modified annuity strips
397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips

What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed throug=
h to your systems?  Does everything prior to the current month need to be au=
to-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?

Thanks!

Andrea
