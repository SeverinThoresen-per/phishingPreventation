This language looks fine to me, but ELIZABETH is the structure ok with you? =
(The participating transmission owners (PTO) will be getting paid their reve=
nue requirements by the RTO, so I think the RTO and the PTOs having a lock b=
ox is fine.  (from what I can recall from my old accountant days).  Thanks.

Christi and Susan,

Below is a message that I had sent to Steve Walton earlier this morning aski=
ng for his assessment of a section of the Acme (DSTAR) TCA.  Can you tell me=
 if the text below is standard practice or is it more than favorable to the =
PTO?

Thanks,

Dave

Steve,

Are you familar with any fund(s) management in the context of RTO West or ot=
her such entity.  Below is some of the language in the "Acme" aka DSTAR TCA,=
 I am not expereinced in this at all, but some of this looks suspect to me (=
Too may PTO rights).  Any comments you have would be helpful.

Thanks,

Dave
