in the ISDA for general corporates and GOVERNMENTALS (which you know are=20
treated differently). =20

There is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the West in looking=
=20
at Swaps.  I want to be able to show them how the ISA contract fits together=
=20
with the credit support annex and confirmation letter.  I have built a pro=20
forma Cofirrm based on the SoCal Water deal you worked on with me.  Can you=20
make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e-mail=20
these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage=
=20
them to get contracts and credit in place with us?  I know you are hesitant=20
to do this, but it would help our marketing significantly.

Thanks

Chris
