Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It =
was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.  All of you must h=
ave done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your=
 teams to attend, because the ballroom was full! =20

A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we h=
ave reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can=
 show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few =
others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.

Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa =
Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retai=
ning Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like=
 to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week. =20

Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like =
for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the =
afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team membe=
rs who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for=
 you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that David is in charge of=
 this tournament? =20

I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  Meagan and I will be in D=
allas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE whe=
n I get there.  I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical come=
s up.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!  --Sa=
lly=20
