Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on=20
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on=20
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for=20
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it=20
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete)=20
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or=20
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the=20
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was=20
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move=20
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Tom=20
