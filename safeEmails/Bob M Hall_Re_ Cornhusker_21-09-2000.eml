If the plants become an external counterparty, the fee should probably go=20
back to the=20
scale in the original contract.  The assumption being that the original plan=
t=20
financing could afford
the escalating fee.

Let me know if you want me to look into it any further.

thanks

bob

Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about=20
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee=20
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of th=
e=20
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk=20
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please=20
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John
