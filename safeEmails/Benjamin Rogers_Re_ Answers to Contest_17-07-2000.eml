Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide=20
audience with this advertisement. =20
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these=20
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get a=
n=20
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that=20
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.
Thanks
Ben Rogers
