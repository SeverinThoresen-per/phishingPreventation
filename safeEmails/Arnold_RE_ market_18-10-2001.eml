stg adjusted means factoring in cost of carry and taxes
stg curve looks more realistic in market areas when you add basis on.

Thanks.
Surprised your shorts are still so confident.  Trade shorts are quickly losi=
ng confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum.  I think curve =
flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down.
1.  jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve.  For market ar=
ea sales, add on basis and dec and march are next.  Question is whether ther=
e is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the pro=
ducing region.  A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineerin=
g reasons.  Million dollar question. =20
2.  Think Nov bidweek will be weak.  Don't know who baseload buyers are unle=
ss trade gets bullish.  Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections.=
  stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities wil=
l be planning to meet load using stg.  At current prices, producers apply mo=
re pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid=
, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back.  Dont think gas market c=
an handle that. =20
3.  No clue.

awesome call on cash.. it does not get any better than that.. you picked the=
 bottom-  i am getting it slowly.. lots of calls today from people i do not =
speak to every day.. not too much panic from guys who are short.. most looki=
ng to put more on.. selling dec01 outright or buying gas daily puts on dec a=
nd jan... except pulaski  who pared down dec01 short with us from 4000 to 10=
00.. do not think he's got on alot elsewhere.  no one has anything on longer=
 dated.. no one can figure out economy...
=20
questions:
1. why would any of the discretionary storage operators withdraw gas in the =
winter based on the current curve?
2. where do you think index gets set this month? i am thinking that utilitie=
s will overestimate loads for Nov01 and buy more during bidweek.. index gets=
 set high and depending on Nov weather.. it could come back onto the market =
weakening cash again..
3. do you have a view on eastern power for the winter? i do not understand t=
he market drivers in the winter.

thanks very much,
