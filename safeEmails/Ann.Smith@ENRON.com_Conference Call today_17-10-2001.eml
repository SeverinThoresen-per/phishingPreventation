Subject:	Indicated Shippers

I just received a voice mail from Kathy Edwards, attorney for Indicated Ship=
pers.  She said her clients were not willing to "carve-out" the two issues o=
f competitive bidding and scheduling rights for the Commission to decide as =
separate policy issues.  Indicated shippers said both issues have to be a pa=
rt of a settlement.

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers dema=
nds may make a settlement impossible.  We need to consider whether TW is wil=
ling to go further in regard to either or both of the Indicated Shippers pos=
itions (so far TW has said no).  Additionally thought should be given to whe=
ther appointment of a settlement judge at this time might be helpful.

I will try to get a call set up to discuss.  In the mean time, any feedback =
you have would be helpful.  Greg
