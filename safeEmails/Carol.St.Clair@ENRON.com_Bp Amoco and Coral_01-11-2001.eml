The Amoco netting Agreement has been finalized and will be circulated for si=
gnature tomorrow as soon as I get execution sets from their attorney.  On th=
e Coral side, the EEI and Guaranty issues have been agreed to and documentat=
ion will be executed no later than tomorrow.  My understanding from Harlan M=
urphy, a colleague of mine, is that Coral is NOT requiring the Netting Agree=
ment in order to do the ring trades.
