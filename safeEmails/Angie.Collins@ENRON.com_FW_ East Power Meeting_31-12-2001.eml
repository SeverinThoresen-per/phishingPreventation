We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on =
the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we =
will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  G=
iven the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules =
in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on=
 the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevan=
t parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Pow=
er contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for K=
evin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As mos=
t of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in =
the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM throug=
h the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through =
the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they=
 will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don
