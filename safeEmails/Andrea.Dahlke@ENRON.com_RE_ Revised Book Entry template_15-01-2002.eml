to my knowledge, whenever we set up new gas books we always request all attr=
ibute types to be attached  (i.e. gas daily, basis, index, etc...).

Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to Jeff, I believe=
 the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want =
as the database will be entry.  Andrea, I agree that you should keep a power=
 list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set=
 up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, =
index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.
