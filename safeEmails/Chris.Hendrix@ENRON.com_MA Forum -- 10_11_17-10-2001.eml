Forum revisits energy issues=20

BOSTON-- Considerable progress has been made to restructure the state's elec=
tric power industry, but four years into the process, several lingering issu=
es need revisiting, officials said yesterday.
     At a daylong forum at the Federal Reserve, legislators, utility executi=
ves, and consumer advocates said the 1998 law likely needs some fine-tuning,=
 but the benefits of restructuring have largely come to pass.
     The restructuring law, passed amid the promise of lower electric rates =
and competitive suppliers, has not been a panacea, but it has done much of w=
hat was intended, said James Connelly, chairman of the Department of Telecom=
munications and Energy.
     A robust retail market has failed to emerged, but restructuring has she=
pherded into place a surplus of wholesale power that insulates the region fr=
om California-like problems, Mr. Connelly told an audience of about 110.
     For the first time in Massachusetts, default customers for one utility =
-- Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Co. -- are poised to pay less than their=
 standard-offer counterparts, he said.
     "We hope that's indicative of things to come," Mr. Connelly said. "We'v=
e got some work to do on that, but hopefully, we'll see something shortly th=
at will push that ball further down the field."
     DTE, which was battered last year for allowing utilities to recoup the =
costs of rising fuel prices, made the right call, Mr. Connelly said. The pro=
cess might have been painful, but it sent a message to the market that shoul=
d stir more interest from other suppliers.
     House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who organized the event, said he want=
ed to hear a broad range of opinions before considering how to address the l=
aw's potential shortcomings.
     "I'm encouraged by what I see and hear," Mr. Finneran said during a bre=
ak. "I like to think we're taking a long-term view. If Massachusetts is to s=
ucceed, we need a dependable supply of energy. Without that, you revert to t=
he same status as a Third World country."
     Mr. Finneran said he was not concerned only 4,078 businesses and reside=
ntial customers have opted to purchase electricity from a competitive suppli=
er -- even though it was one of the restructuring act's goals.
     He said the rapid price increases last year kept many people from leavi=
ng their standard-offer service, but falling prices in recent weeks will lik=
ely prompt many customers to consider a competitive supplier.
     "It's not a fatal consequence," Mr. Finneran said. "We need to get a mo=
re robust market out there, and how we do that is one of the issues we need =
to talk more about."
     Standard-offer service, which will be phased out, was crafted to give c=
ustomers savings of 15 percent during the first two years of restructuring.
     Default-service customers are those who signed up for power after the i=
ndustry's March 1998 restructuring, moved to a different utility service ter=
ritory or returned to their old utility after leaving a competitive power su=
pplier.
     Standard-offer customers are those who have bought power from the same =
utility since before restructuring.
     Standard-offer customers initially saw price cuts -- totaling an estima=
ted $1.7 billion -- but those subsidies curtailed suppliers from entering th=
e market, Mr. Connelly said.
     "The temptation to extend standard-offer service should be resisted," h=
e said. "It was necessary to give consumers a sense of value, but it has bee=
n a major roadblock to the emergence of competitive suppliers."
     Rep. John J. Binienda Sr., D-Worcester, said new air emissions standard=
s might need revisiting because they would likely force some older power pla=
nts to go offline. Losing that reliable supply of energy might be a problem =
if it cannot be easily replaced, said Mr. Binienda, chairman of the House En=
ergy Committee.
     David L. O'Connor, commissioner of the Division of Energy Resources, sa=
id current price trends are encouraging but the state remains a long way awa=
y from achieving the full vision of restructuring.
     Utilities such as Massachusetts Electric and NSTAR, which were to be so=
lely distribution companies, remain involved in procurement because of few c=
ompetitive suppliers, he said.
     Short-term price hikes for wholesale power have yet to curtail the reta=
il demand for electricity and the reliability of some distribution companies=
 has been poor in some cases, he said.
     "This is a symptom of a system that remains relatively immature," Mr. O=
'Connor said.
     Under the law, investor-owned utilities moved out of the generating bus=
iness and became mostly distribution companies. But the law's fine print als=
o enabled utilities to recoup millions they say they have lost from selling =
power at prices below the cost of generation.
     Those added costs soared last year because of rising oil and natural ga=
s prices, producing a tempest which put the law under re-examination.
     Cheryl A. LaFleur, president and chief executive officer of Massachuset=
ts Electric, said now is the time to study restructuring the industry becaus=
e standard-offer service ends Feb. 28, 2005.
     She said standard-offer rates and default rates are quite close and wil=
l likely fall if fuel prices continue to decline.
     Competitive suppliers are still not interested in the retail market, sa=
id both Ms. LaFleur and George R. Gantz, senior vice president of Unitil Cor=
p., the parent of Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light.
     The transition to a market-based environment for energy generation has =
not always been palatable, but the law is fundamentally sound and workable, =
Mr. Connelly said.
     DTE has tried to walk a tight rope this year, balancing the needs of co=
nsumers against those of an industry vital to everyone's well-being, he said=
=2E The rolling blackouts in California this year showed everyone how hard a=
 job that can be, he said.
     "California showed that a public utilities commission can kill a market=
 by doing foolish and cowardly things," he said.=20
