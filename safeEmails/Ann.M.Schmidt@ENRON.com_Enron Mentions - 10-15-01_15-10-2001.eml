Oil drillers, which have been pummelled in recent months as energy companies=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL: Tata in talks to buy Enron power plant=20
Financial Times; Oct 15, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and KHOZEM MERCHANT

Tata, the Indian conglom-erate, has held exploratory talks to buy a controve=
rsial power plant from Enron, the US energy giant.=20
Tata Power, part of the Bombay-based industrial group, has written to the In=
dian government expressing interest in the plant, which is India's biggest f=
oreign investment. However, it said any deal would have to address the high =
tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project.=20
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive and chairman, told the Financial Times =
in August that Enron and its partners wanted to retrieve the Dollars 1bn inc=
urred building the now-defunct Dabhol plant.=20
It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents =
to the dollar.=20
Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the =
best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian finan=
cial backers, to take on Dabhol.=20
Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved w=
ith the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, al=
so attended.=20
About 70 per cent of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financ=
ial institutions providing Dollars 1.4bn and foreign lenders the balance. En=
ron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to internation=
al lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Bo=
ard (MSEB), the plant's sole client.=20
Analysts favour a quick sale. "Tata would be a faster exit and resolve it on=
ce and for all," said Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. "It is better to take a =
small loss and move along. Dabhol periodically becomes a problem and an issu=
e, and it depresses the stock."=20
Analysts said the fit between Tata and its putative target would be compleme=
ntary, though it would probably stretch the company's balance sheet.=20
The Tata group is already committed to a heavy capital expenditure of some R=
s30bn (Dollars 625m) on power-related projects over the next three years.=20
A further Rs9bn is slated for telecommunications and broadband projects.=20

Base Metals Traders Struggle In Tough Trading Conditions

SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- The spate of decisions by big-name participants to scal=
e down or quit base metals trading last week didn't surprise participants in=
 Asia, given the market's tough trading conditions, they said.=20
In fact, should the current dismal conditions prevail for the next six month=
s, more such announcements are likely, they added.
Their comments follow the recent decisions by prominent members of the Londo=
n Metal Exchange to either downsize their base metals trading divisions or q=
uit entirely.=20
"Clearly, they, like us, are victims of reduced volumes," said a senior LME =
trader in Sydney, adding that all market participants are suffering from the=
 declining throughputs and trade volumes.=20
Figures from the LME's Web site show that the trading volumes for aluminum, =
copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc fell a total 10.6% to 41,027,075 contract=
s for the first nine months of this year from the same period last year.=20
"We're just seeing the beginning of it," a senior trader with a big U.S.-bas=
ed trading house in Tokyo told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.=20
Last week, N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. said it would cease base metals tradin=
g except for its Australian business.=20
Chairman Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement, "In light of difficult tr=
ading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limi=
ted base metals operations are no longer viable."=20
ScotiaMocatta, the base metals trading unit of Toronto-based Bank of Nova Sc=
otia (T.BNS), said it would cut staff as well as exit LME ring dealing.=20
With ScotiaMocatta's exit, there will be 11 LME ring dealing members. These =
members have the exclusive right to trade in the open-outcry ring.=20
Earlier, Houston-based Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Eu=
rope, while associate broker clearing member Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. =
in July ceased its market-making activities to focus on clearing and broking=
=2E=20
The senior trader said he wasn't surprised by these developments and ominous=
ly projected more to come should the difficult trading conditions continue i=
n the next six months.=20
Market Not Pricing Future Demand=20

"People are really not pricing any future demand" into their positions, he s=
aid.=20
One indication is the lack of forward pricing in LME's base metals contracts=
 despite the current depressed prices, he said.=20
With LME three-month copper and aluminum prices around 25% down from their l=
evels at the start of the year, he would have expected to see forward buying=
 following previous experience.=20
"But if everybody's restructuring, you don't even know if you are going to b=
e here into 2002, 2003," he said.=20
Despite having tumbled to very low levels, analysts and market participants =
project further downside for base metals prices as they push back forecasts =
of a price recovery following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.=20
One of Japan's trading giants, Marubeni Corp. (J.MRB), said Monday that the =
attacks have pushed back the timing of the aluminum market's recovery by two=
 to three months.=20
It also cut its forecasts for this year's trading range of the LME three-mon=
th aluminum contract to $1,250-$1,450 a metric ton, compared with last year'=
s $1,451-$1,730/ton range.=20
Indeed, the past few years have thrown base metals into extremely difficult =
trading conditions, traders said.=20
Just as the Asian markets were recovering from the 1997 financial crisis, th=
e U.S. economy sputtered to a halt, they said. The terrorist attacks Sept. 1=
1 and the subsequent retaliation threw a spanner in the works, they added.=20
The bellwether copper and aluminum contracts last week fell to their lowest =
levels in 28 months, while zinc prices also notched 14-year lows. Tin prices=
 are at their lowest levels in 20 years.=20
A prominent casualty is the world's largest combined lead and zinc producer,=
 Australia's Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS).=20
Having to compete for business in such a tough environment, brokers have had=
 to cut their commissions, said the Tokyo-based trader.=20
Another Tokyo-based trader said buying interest has been thin, as buyers pre=
fer to wait for lower prices.=20
"There are buyers in the market, but their (price) targets are lower," he sa=
id.=20
He added that the company he is with stopped trading for a week after hearin=
g talk that Rothschild was scaling down its operations.=20
At 1010 GMT, LME three-month copper was at $1,401/ton; three-month aluminum =
was at $1,302/ton; three-month zinc was at $791.50/ton and three-month tin w=
as at $3,800/ton.=20

INDIA: Tata Power Q2 net seen down 8.5 pct yoy.

10/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Tata Power Company, India's largest private utili=
ty, is expected to report profit for the past quarter fell 8.5 percent on ye=
ar, squeezed by higher interest costs and slower sales, analysts say.=20
The company, which is negotiating to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's stak=
e in its troubled Indian unit, reports results for the July-September second=
 quarter on Tuesday.
"I expect profit to be hit by higher interest costs on new projects such as =
transmission and telecoms, and sales growth to be affected by the absence of=
 supplies to BSES Ltd this year," said Pranav Securities analyst Rohita Shar=
ma.=20
She said the sale of power to BSES Ltd , a rival producer and leading distri=
butor of power to Bombay, was a major factor in boosting sales in the year-e=
arlier quarter.=20
"I see operating margins falling to 19.05 percent from 19.85 percent," Sharm=
a added.=20
A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages, released last week, forecast net profit wou=
ld drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees ($26.4 million) from a year earlier,=
 on a 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees.=20
Tata Power generates thermal and hydroelectric power and distributes electri=
city across the western Indian state of Maharashtra, including its capital B=
ombay.=20
As part of its new initiatives, the company commissioned a broadband optic f=
ibre cable network in Bombay in late August.=20
Jaideep Goswami, head of research at UTI Securities, said profit would be fl=
at, helped by extraordinary income from the sale of its stake in Tata Lieber=
t, a maker of air-conditioning equipment and UPS, or uninterrupted power sup=
ply, for computers.=20
Tata Power sold the stake for 765 million rupees in September.=20
"Other income will be a crucial factor with power sales struggling as a resu=
lt of the slowdown in the economy," he said, adding it could benefit from so=
me businesses like captive units.=20
Tata Power runs captive power units for India's largest private steel produc=
er Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) and the country's second largest ceme=
nt maker Associated Cement Companies .=20
An independent power project, in Belgaum, in southern India, went on stream =
in March.=20
SHARES WATCH ENRON=20
Goswami said the possible buyout of Enron's 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power=
 Company could be the major driver for the stock.=20
"At this point it's by no means certain the deal will happen, but if it does=
, a lot would depend on how it is structured and the cost of the project," h=
e said.=20
"It's definitely a big booster for sentiment as Enron's unit supplies to are=
as contiguous to Tata Power's," he said. "But there are concerns about how i=
ts cash flows will be impacted."=20
Shares in Tata Power were little changed at 97.50 rupees in afternoon trade =
while the Bombay benchmark index was up 0.7 percent.=20
Tata Power managing director Adi Engineer told Reuters earlier this month th=
at he had held preliminary talks with Enron to buy the American firm's stake=
 in the $2.9 billion Dabhol unit.=20
"Everyone knows some solution has to be found for Dabhol...we will go ahead =
with this only if it makes sense from the consumers' angle and the stakehold=
ers' angle," he said.=20
Dabhol was forced to shut its 740 MW plant on the west coast of India, after=
 its sole customer, a state-owned loss-ridden Indian utility, stopped buying=
 power.=20
The utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, earlier defaulted on p=
ayments.=20
The shutdown has stalled an expansion programme, which was almost complete a=
nd would have taken the capacity to 2,184 MW. ($1 =3D 48 Indian rupees).

India: FDI: Suffering from sectoral infirmities

10/15/2001

THE exit of Enron and AES from the Indian power scene has generated worry. F=
or, more than affecting power generation, this might have a lasting impact o=
n the prospects of foreign direct investment in India. This is because the U=
S is the biggest investor in India, and power generation was seen as one of =
the most attractive areas. But, then, this did not happen suddenly, and the =
portents were visible from ever since Cogentrix pulled out.=20
But despite such fears, FDI increased substantially in 2000. On an approval =
basis, it increased 27.5 per cent in 2000 (from $6,750 million in 1999 to $8=
,610 million in 2000). American investments rose 14.6 per cent (from $851.2 =
million in 1999 to $975.6 million in 2000).
What then is the fallacy? One reason why the flows were not affected is that=
, overall, the FDI trend in India is not affected by any sector, no matter h=
ow important it is. Presently, the policy constraints to foreign investment =
are confined to select sectors, and sectoral policies are emerging the deter=
minants of the FDI flow trend. The policies in some sectors such as power, t=
elecommunications and oil may not be conducive, but in others, particularly =
manufacturing, they are comparable to any other countrys.=20
Even after a decade of liberalisation, independent power producers are findi=
ng it difficult to set up operations, with the State electricity boards in f=
inancial straits. Thus, of the 50,000 MW projects approved in the private se=
ctor, only 3,000 MW were added during 1991-99. Non-transparent policies in b=
asic, cellular and wireless local loop services are preventing foreign inves=
tors from coming into the telecom and oil refining sector sin a big way. Not=
hing is as yet clear about the dismantling of Administrative Price Mechanism=
 in the petroleum sector that is scheduled for April 1, 2002.=20
However, this is not true for other sectors. In automotive or in electrical/=
electronic industries, no MNC has so far pulled out. Instead, more players a=
re coming in. As a result, the actual flow of foreign investments has been i=
n automobile and electrical/electric equipment sectors though FDI was approv=
ed largely in power and telecommunications.=20
For instance, in 2000 nearly 30 per cent of the actual total flow of FDI was=
 in the transport sector, mainly automobiles and electrical equipment indust=
ries against only 15 per cent flow in power, oil refinery and telecommunicat=
ion. In contrast, 36 per cent of FDI was approved in transport and electrica=
l industries against 41 per cent approved in power, oil refinery and telecom=
munication during 2000. The automotive sector attracted a $1.2-billion in FD=
I in the 1990s and grew at 20 per cent from 1991-99; the result of the flow =
of foreign investment and its impact on the industry.=20
Further, contradicting the fear hyped over the foreign investment prospect d=
ue to the Enron exit, a recent study by the American Chamber of Commerce ref=
lected the US investors positive perception of Indias vast potential. Accord=
ing to the study, the country has the potential to attract FDI of $100 milli=
on over the next five years, if certain improvements are made in the regulat=
ory measures and to the sectoral policies that are acting as barriers to for=
eign investors.=20
A study by the RBI unveiled a glorified result of the business performance o=
f foreign-invested firms in India. The study, covering 334 firms, revealed t=
hat their average return on equity was 12.5-13 per cent during 1998-99 and 1=
999-2000, which, in terms of global standards, is lucrative. The interesting=
 part of the study is that the rate of return on equity in case of US-invest=
ed firms was as high as 12 per cent. Japanese and British firms, however, re=
corded higher returns on equity 22 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.=20
Further, these high rates of return on equity were reaped up mostly from dom=
estic sales, and the firms had to exert less to export, and area where compe=
tition is intensifying by the day. The study revealed that the ratio of expo=
rt intensity of sales was 4-6 per cent during 1998-99 and 1999-2000. That is=
, these firms are garnering higher returns by selling more than 95 per cent =
of their production in the domestic market. In terms of industry, the RBI st=
udy revealed that not only the return on equity, but also the growth rate of=
 returns were high in automobile and electrical industries. Thus, the attrac=
tion of these sectors and the consequent large actual flows of FDI. The retu=
rn on equity in the auto industry was 14.6 per cent in 1999-2000 the second =
highest after pharmaceutical and the growth rate in return was 27 per cent o=
ver the previous years.=20
The return for the electrical equipment industry was 10.5 per cent in 1999-2=
000 and growth rate in return as high as 40 per cent over the previous year.=
 Therefore, the barriers often highlighted for the slow pace of FDI are not =
strictly related to the countrys overall policy. The FDI gets bogged down be=
cause of sectoral policy constraints, each different from the other.=20
The American Chambers study admits that such macro-level factors as inflexib=
le labour laws and poor infrastructure play a relatively less important role=
 in encouraging foreign investment than the sectoral policy constraints.=20
It is difficult to offer an ideal investment policy. But, certainly, the cou=
ntry has inherent strengths such as skilled manpower, huge domestic market a=
nd a stable democratic government that are conducive to attracting foreign i=
nvestments. The RBI study confirms this. It only remains to tap this potenti=
al.=20

International: Indian Enron looks for way out of Greenfield Shipping
SHIRISH NADKARNI IN MUMBAI

10/15/2001
Lloyd's List International

Copyright (C) 2001 LLoyds List; Source: World Reporter (TM)

AMERICAN energy major Enron is looking at a price of around Dollars 30m to e=
xit from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which its affiliate Atlantic Commer=
cial is a 20% equity partner.=20
The desire to exit is part of Enron's move to pull out of all its projects i=
n India.
The other two partners in the three-member consortium are Mitsui OSK Lines (=
MOL), which has 60% equity, and Indian national carrier Shipping Corporation=
 of India (SCI), with a 20% stake.=20
Greenfield Shipping had commissioned the construction of a 137,000 cu m capa=
city LNG tanker at Mitsubishi Shipyard in Japan.=20
The vessel, christened LNG Lakshmi, will be ready for delivery on November 1=
5 this year.=20
It will be used for ferrying LNG from the Middle East to Enron's 2,184 mw me=
ga-power plant at Dabhol, near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra.=20
Although no official statement has come from Enron, a source at ANZ Investme=
nt Bank, which leads the lending consortium of banks, revealed that Enron wo=
uld seek the return of Dollars 11m as its share of the paid-up equity of Dol=
lars 55m, plus Dollars 19m for swapping the company's share of the loan comp=
onent.=20
The highly publicised imbroglio between Enron and Maharashtra State Electric=
ity Board over the tariff to be charged for power induced Enron to seek an e=
xit from the project.=20
This has induced the lending consortium to be extra cautious after having di=
sbursed Dollars 110m of the aggregate loan component of Dollars 165m. It has=
 asked the promoters to bring in this amount.=20
The intransigence of the lenders has left MOL and SCI with the difficult tas=
k of not only paying Enron off, but also bringing in the Dollars 55m debt am=
ount, if they are to take delivery of the vessel on the scheduled date next =
month.=20
The SCI board has had extensive discussions on the subject, but failed to co=
me to a consensus on putting in the extra funds. And during discussions held=
 in London recently, MOL had clearly told the lenders it was not in favour o=
f putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal.=20
MOL feels the economics do not justify the extra expenditure. The consortium=
 is now facing a charter hire rate of Dollars 60,000-Dollars 65,000 per day,=
 compared with the rate of Dollars 98,600 initially negotiated with the Dabh=
ol Power Company.=20
If one took a daily charter hire rate of Dollars 60,000, Greenfield would ea=
rn around Dollars 22m per annum, of which Dollars 4-Dollars 5m would be spen=
t on operating expenses of the tanker.=20
That would leave Dollars 17-Dollars 18m, yielding an internal rate of return=
 (IRR) of just 7%-8% for MOL on its 60% equity stake. This would be unaccept=
able for the Japanese line.=20
For SCI, the IRR would be even lower - 4%-4.5%, far below the Indian governm=
ent norm of 12% for projects involving state funding.
