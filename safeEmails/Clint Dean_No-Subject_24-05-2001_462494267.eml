Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke=
=20
with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting=
=20
together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at=20
Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three=20
years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 2=
7=20
and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested i=
n=20
hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good=20
friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you=20
think, and we can go from there.

Clint
