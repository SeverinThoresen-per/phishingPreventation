awesome call on cash.. it does not get any better than that.. you picked the=
 bottom-  i am getting it slowly.. lots of calls today from people i do not =
speak to every day.. not too much panic from guys who are short.. most looki=
ng to put more on.. selling dec01 outright or buying gas daily puts on dec a=
nd jan... except pulaski  who pared down dec01 short with us from 4000 to 10=
00.. do not think he's got on alot elsewhere.  no one has anything on longer=
 dated.. no one can figure out economy...

questions:
1. why would any of the discretionary storage operators withdraw gas in the =
winter based on the current curve?
2. where do you think index gets set this month? i am thinking that utilitie=
s will overestimate loads for Nov01 and buy more during bidweek.. index gets=
 set high and depending on Nov weather.. it could come back onto the market =
weakening cash again..
3. do you have a view on eastern power for the winter? i do not understand t=
he market drivers in the winter.
