Jay,

I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(B=
asis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps f=
or Power.

We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.=
  They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidi=
ty at each location. =20

You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041.=20

Thanks for your help.

Phillip
