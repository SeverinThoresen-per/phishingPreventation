Irene,
 These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As suc=
h=20
I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment=20
date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract=20
file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree?

Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you!

In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have=20
encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in referenc=
e=20
to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales.

What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date?

 What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date?

What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the=20
assignment date?
