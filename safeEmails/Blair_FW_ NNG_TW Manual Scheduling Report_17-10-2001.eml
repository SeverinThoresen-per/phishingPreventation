	How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do tod=

	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good=
 about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just doll=
ars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week. =20

	Thanks. Lynn
