Hi Lynn,

According to my records, I do not see where we used  our WAPA transmission o=
n May 12th or May 20th.

I do see purchases from WAPA at Midway on those days, but losses are not bil=
lable to Enron on those purchases as the energy was purchased at Midway.

My tags are as follows:

May 12th. Day total of 370,  tag 22299

May 20th,  Day total of 55,  Tag # 22803

If your records indicate that we used WAPA transmission on our own account f=
or those days, please provide me the OASIS number that was assigned to this =
transmission.

Thank you
