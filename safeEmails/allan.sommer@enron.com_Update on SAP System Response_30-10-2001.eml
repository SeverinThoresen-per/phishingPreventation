As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the Septembe=
r Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been w=
orking diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report th=
at significant progress has been made.  With the October month-end close fas=
t approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made=
 in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.

Poor Performing Programs
The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.  Some program r=
edesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year =
end.  In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have b=
een tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable En=
ron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.

Workload Distribution
The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result =
in system "bottlenecks".  We have accelerated the purchase of system hardwar=
e to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to y=
ear-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide busine=
ss users with more information regarding efficient methods of report executi=
on.  Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the=
 various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficien=
t report execution during the close process.=20

Improved Close Monitoring
The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in ord=
er to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiat=
ive is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better moni=
tor, identify, and escalate close-related problems. =20

Communication Strategy Implement
The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our custom=
ers in the event of future system performance issues.  This plan will ensure=
 that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and=
 resolution status in a timely manner.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regardin=
g our efforts to improve overall system performance.
