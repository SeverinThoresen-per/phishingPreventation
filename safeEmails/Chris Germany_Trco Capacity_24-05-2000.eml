I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still=20
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective=20
3/31/2000.
  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES. =20

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.0=
0=20
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then w=
e=20
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal=20
227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the=20
credit either today or tomorrow.

Thanks.
