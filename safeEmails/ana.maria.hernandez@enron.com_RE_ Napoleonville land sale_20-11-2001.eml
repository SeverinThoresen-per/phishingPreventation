I have spoken with Robert Tilotta with the Ad Valorum Tax Group, and he said=
 that in general all ad valorum taxes for 2000 have been paid.  He is going =
to pull the payment information.  I will keep you updated.

Since the total book value for the 354.36 acres of land is 1,434,968.64, the=
n each acre is worth $4,049.47.  The amount for the tract being sold is 1,33=
6,811.04 (330.12 @ $4,049.47)

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the=
 purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 =
acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that =
land. =20

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem t=
axes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been pai=
d.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is=
 the case. =20

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate =
a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.
