This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and =
RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working o=
n this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if=
 is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large=
 number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automat=
ed solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks.=

This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
