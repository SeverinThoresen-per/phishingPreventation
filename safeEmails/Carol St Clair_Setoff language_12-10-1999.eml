Elizabeth:
We are in the process of negotiating 2 ISDA masters with a counterparty, 1=20
with ENA and 1 with PGE.  In looking at our setoff language, it would appear=
=20
as if under certain circumstances the application of such language would=20
result in PGE subsidizing ENA's payment obligations.  How would you suggest=20
we handle this?  If we do nothing and such provision is unenforceable and we=
=20
rely on our severability language, are we okay?
Carol
