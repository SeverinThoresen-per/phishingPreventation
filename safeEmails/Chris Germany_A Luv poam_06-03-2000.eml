  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway.=20
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan.=20
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can.=20
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud;=20
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd.=20
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms,=20
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms.=20
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know,=20
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe.=20
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man,=20
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can.=20
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead.=20
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed.=20
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt,=20
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt.=20
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack,=20
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack.=20
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'.=20

  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank.=20

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day;=20
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.=20

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day,=20
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.=20

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth.=20
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth.=20
