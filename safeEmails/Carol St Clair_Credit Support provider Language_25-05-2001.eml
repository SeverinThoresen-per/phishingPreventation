We are still discussing internally the time period that should be specified=20
in the definition of Credit Support Provider.  We are not comfortable with=20
specifying October 2002 as the date.  What is the reason for this?  We are=20
trying to make this language as transaction specific as possible.  Is there=20
anything else that we can add to it to make it more precise?  Please call me=
=20
in the morning.  I'm in by 8:30.  Thanks.
