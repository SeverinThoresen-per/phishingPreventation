	Shelley, I talked with Kent Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group =
sends=20
	storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes.  They do NOT send anything t=
o
	AGA.  But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information fro=
m EIA
	so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers.  As a remind=
er
	this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up=
 with Kent.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
