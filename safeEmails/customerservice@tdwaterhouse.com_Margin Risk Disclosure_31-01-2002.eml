Should You Consider Margin?

For Customers with Margin Accounts: Margin Risk Disclosure

TD Waterhouse is furnishing this information to you to provide some basic fa=
cts about purchasing securities on margin. Securities purchased on margin ar=
e
TD Waterhouse's collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your ac=
count decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your =
loan, and, as a result, TD Waterhouse can take action, such as issue a margi=
n call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held w=
ith
TD Waterhouse, in order to maintain the required equity in the account. Plea=
se note that trading on margin may not be appropriate for all customers. It =
is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securit=
ies on margin.=20

These risks include the following:


You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.

TD Waterhouse can force the sale of securities or other assets in
your account(s).

TD Waterhouse can sell your securities or other assets without
contacting you.

You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your acco=
unt(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call.

TD Waterhouse can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at an=
y time and is not required to provide you advance written notice.

You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.

Should You Consider Margin?
If you are comfortable with the risks associated with margin, you may want t=
o consider adding margin privileges to your account. Margin allows you to us=
e the equity in your account as collateral for a loan that may be used for t=
he purchase of additional securities or for overdraft protection if you have=
 check writing privileges.=20

Please note that margin privileges may be added to Individual, Joint and oth=
er qualified account types. Certain accounts, including retirement (IRA) and=
 custodial accounts, are not eligible for margin privileges.

If you have any questions, please call a TD Waterhouse customer service repr=
esentative at 1-800-934-4448 and press 4.
