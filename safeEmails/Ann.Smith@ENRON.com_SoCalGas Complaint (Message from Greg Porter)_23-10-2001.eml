MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas =
Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September =
28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tar=
iff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the =
1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In s=
ummary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during=
 the Global Settlement. =20

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course =
of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement. =20

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on th=
e commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.   =20

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transw=
estern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has c=
reated ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter o=
f the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the comp=
laint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a si=
x-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation =
factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward f=
or the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Tra=
nswestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly=
, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore poss=
ible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you hav=
e any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me a=
t (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.
