Teaml,

I'm responsible for coordinating the next case - Teltronica, which is due=20
11/6. It happens that my parents are
visiting from the east coast that weekend. I thought that since we haven't=20
had a case due for a couple of weeks,
if there were any chance we could get the case done before the weekend that=20
would help out a lot. We're still two
weeks out from the due date, so we have a lot more time than usual, even wit=
h=20
the take home exam. Let me know if
you guys think we can try to hammer this out next week after the take home's=
=20
out of the way. As well as I recall,
SF has the first half, East Bay has the second this time.

Thanks,
Christine
