Sean,

Here are my initial answers and I encourage others to provide me with their =
thoughts.

Subject:	Comments on order

Here are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling.

1.  How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $=
120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price =
to $98?

Depends on the term off the deal and when it was confirmed.  If the deal is =
longer than 24 hours in length or was negotiated in advance of day of/before=
, the price is not capped.  If you do a "spot" deal (as defined by FERC) and=
 agree to use the  index price, you will need to condition it to be the lowe=
r of index or the cap.

2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?

[Mark Hall]  I believe not.

3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  =
For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and=
 the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and th=
e price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesd=
ay assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wedne=
sday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead c=
ash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?
Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 becau=
se it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wedne=
sday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.
[Mark Hall] =20
See my seperate note where we got sympathy but little hard clarification fro=
m FERC. =20

It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an ind=
ependent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price wa=
s before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it'=
s likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set t=
he cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambig=
uity.  More efficient market, less litigation.

Enron is very concerned about giving CAISO discretion to set the cap and wil=
l raise this issue on re-hearing.  There must be some way to set the cap so =
that it is known at the time business is transacted and that its computation=
 is easily verified.
4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the=
 cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator ha=
ve the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that=
 he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hi=
ts $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demons=
trable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning a=
n option and a generator owning an option?
[Mark Hall] =20
We should talk more about this, especially if you would like Enron to raise =
this on rehearing.  The order is basically silent on options.   The generato=
r must make power available at its marginal cost.  I do not think the cost o=
f an option is an allowable expense unless it can be traced back to an actua=
l generator costs. If a marketer calls and option and then has the power it =
must sell below the cap, so I think in your example the FERC order reduces t=
he value of the option.
