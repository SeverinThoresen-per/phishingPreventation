Gentlemen,=20

Following are my comments to the above guaranty:

1.   Enron does not, as a matter of practice, issue performance guarantees. =
=20
Is there some compelling reason why performance is necessary?
2. In section 2, there has been added an interest penalty component if=20
Guarantor fails to pay upon Payment Demand.  Under the Agreement, will Athen=
s=20
be required to  pay an interest penalty if it fails to pay?  If so, Enron=20
could potentially be exposed to a double interest penalty, one for Enron and=
=20
one for Athens.  Is this the intended  effect?
3. In section 6, paragrpah 4(b), what is the Counterparty's creditworthiness=
=20
requirements? =20

That's it.  Please give me a call to discuss.

Clement
