Here are some thoughs on how we would account for the Offsystem Storage.

Facts
NNG moves 100,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No acc=
ounting entry made to the G/L.
I will look into Form 2 physical reporting changes.

Offsystem inventory is reduced  2,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction.

Case 1	In-Kind is replaced by simple purchase from 3rd party, NNG incurrs th=
e cost.
Debit 803 (Gas Purchases) or 858 (Fuel exp)		2,000 * cost of gas
	Credit A/P						2,000 * cost of gas

Case 1 books all transactions outside of operational storage.  Reducing the =
Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Ope=
rational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the=
 UAF increase.


Case 2	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, NNG incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP

Case 3	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, Tracker incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP
=09
Debit 1823 (Storage Fuel Tracker)	2,000 * MIP
	Credit 805 (Storage Fuel Recovery)	2,000 * MIP
