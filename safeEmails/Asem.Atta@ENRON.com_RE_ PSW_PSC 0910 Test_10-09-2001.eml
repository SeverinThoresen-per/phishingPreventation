Corry,

	As per Will, the understanding was that deals with transmissions were far a=
nd few in between and were currently being manually routed, and this was not=
 a feature to be expected with the current version of Preschedule Workspace =
and so it will not route currently.

	Issue with Deal Scheduling not showing the correct 'physical route' status =
has been addressed and is currently being worked on and will be released wit=
hin the next day or two. The "Edit Strip Information" bug has been forwarded=
 also.
=09
	Able to recreate the 'Edit' bug and fixed, a new version will roll out by a=
fternoon containing the fix.=20

	In regards to the West paths showing up when EAST criteria was selected, th=
is issue was found out to be related to a database modification that was mad=
e to include the REGION code to all transactions. Creating the REGION field,=
 NON-NULLABLE requirement, in the database required a default value to be in=
serted and 'EAST' was chosen; hence transactions which were for the WEST des=
k without an initial region fell into this particular problem.  The erroneou=
s data within the PATH SCHEDULE CONFIRMATIONS has been deleted and all new c=
onfirmed paths will now correctly be displayed since our applications correc=
tly state the REGION information associated with each USER.

	I will update everyone upon a new version of Preschedule Workspace being mo=
ved to Stage

thanks

Will,
I found about the same issues we had already discussed while running the PSW=
/PSC.

I ran the sheet for 6/19 since there were no "West" paths in the confirmatio=
ns (I still see the West paths when "View: East Trading Desk" is checked).

Most of the paths "routed" in Deal Scheduling except for a deal that contain=
ed transmission with the correct Enpower number provided (Error: Capability =
not supported: Cannot route transmission deals)
The "Routing Detail" in Deal Scheduling did not contain a check mark for "Ph=
ysical Route" on any of the physical paths.
Also, in scheduling, the "Edit Strip Information" does not contain the Path =
or comments in the Deal Scheduling Comments section as before.

The physical path that did not route in scheduling also did not go the the P=
ath Confirmations.


Also, I found that when I chose "Edit" on the Pre-Schedule Workspace, it cre=
ated a New Workspace.  It also occurred twice when the mouse cursor passed b=
y the word "edit" without physically clicking on it.

That's about it for today,
Corry
