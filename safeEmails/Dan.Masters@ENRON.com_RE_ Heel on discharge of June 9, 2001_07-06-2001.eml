ordingly.

Dear Sir;

Minimum  quantity heel 3200 m3.
This will theoretically be sufficient for having all 5 tanks ready for
loading in Qalhat 5th July.

As no empiric data is available, in stead of taking more to be on the
safe side, I suggest that we, if found necessary, reduce number of tanks=3D

ready for loading, to let say 3. Then we will start loading at these
three with somewhat reduced rate, and cooling down the two others
simultanously. This operation should not delay us more than 4 hours.

The other alternative is to take 3600 m3.

Captain Bentzr=F8d-

Please leave a heel of LNG on board the vessel sufficient to reach the
next loading in Qalhat on July 5 in load ready condition.  Please
estimate the volume you will require and revert, keeping in mind that we
would like to unload as much as possible on June 9 at Lake Charles
within the parameters outlined above.

Thanks and regards,

Dan Masters
