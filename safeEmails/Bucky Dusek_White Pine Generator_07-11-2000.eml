Tom,

I am an analyst with Metals Origination in London and got your name from=20
David Oliver.  Enron Metals is in the process of dealing with White Pine=20
Copper Refinery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  One of the options we=20
are reviewing is returning a dormant generator to operation and selling the=20
excess power.  Natural gas is delivered to White Pine through an Enron=20
pipeline.  The generator can run on either natural gas or coal.  Several=20
years ago ('96 or '97), Enron contacted White Pine (previously owned by BHP=20
Copper White Pine Refinery) on numerous occasions about running the=20
powerhouse on gas and they would get the excess power to market.  The idea a=
t=20
the time was they had excess natural gas and wanted White Pine to run the=20
generators on gas.  Would you know anything about this deal or who the=20
originator was?  If so, could you or the originator please contact me=20
regarding the details.  If not, could you please direct me to someone who ma=
y=20
know about the original proposal?

Regards,

Bucky Dusek
