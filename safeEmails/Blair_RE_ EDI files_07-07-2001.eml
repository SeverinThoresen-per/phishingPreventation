Mike, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file Jeff
sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone availabl=
e
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.

Tammy & Jesse,

Just wanted to touch base with you on todays activities.
We have address the problem with Utilicorp and you will now see 40 records o=
n all meters.
A test file has been sent and Jesse notified. Please let me know of any furt=
her problems
that may develope on this file.
Jesse has notified me that the Entex file had a problem and will let me know=
 what the point=20
of failure item is. We will move to correct this immediately.
I have not heard if there were any problems with the Texaco files.

Any problem that we find will any EDI file will be resolved and that resolut=
ion will be implemeted=20
for ALL EDI files. Like the 40 record problem on Utilicorp.

I want to be sure and emphisize that EDI is our top priority right now and w=
e have every intention
to have these files ready on close night. If by some chance we still have pr=
oblems the night of close
we will continue to resolve them to get the files out ASAP. Unlike the MIPS =
system, PGAS enables
us to run the EDI file over and over till we have what we need from the syst=
em. As long as the customers=20
knows that we are redeveloping the file we send them they should understand =
that there MAY be a=20
delay in them getting their data. I do not intend for this to occur but they=
 may need a heads up if you
have not already done that.=20
The backup plan for all of this is fairly simple, Other than a copy of the s=
tatements there is not one.
Going back to MIPS is not an option. The June data has not been entered into=
 MIPS(except EFM)
and will not be available. Utilicorp already receives a number of copies of =
the statements. If there is=20
someone or some department that would also need a copy in the event of a del=
ay in the file we will sent=20
it to them.

If you have any questions regarding the EDI files please feel free to contac=
t me.
I am currently working an afternoon to evening shift so will not be availabl=
e in the morning
except by pager.(713-813-8096)
Tks, Jeff
