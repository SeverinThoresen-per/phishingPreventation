1. Rick,  are you the person to prepare the schedule?

2. It is not  readily apparent to me that we necessarily should feel under=20
any obligation to"show cause" that we are not in default , although a civil=20
non-inflammatory reequest to discuss the issue would probably have been well=
=20
received..it seems to me that if we grovel now in a defensive and reactive=20
manner it keeps them with the initiative (Q. Do we really think they are=20
prepared to throw the dice and declare the default?) =20

3.  How much was paid for the interests is none of their  #$@%& business.=20

4. What Limited Waiver Agreement?  Did I get a copy? I can't find it in my=20
email.

As agreed, I spoke with Clifton. He explained his  letter to me. I told him=20
that I was under the impression that the issue over the  transfer documents=20
was resolved in favor of a schedule. He said that he was not  aware of that.=
=20
When I asked him point blank whether Brazos was declaring a  default, he=20
referred me to Pat Long.=20
?
I just got off the phone with Pat. I asked Pat if  the letter was a "default=
=20
letter" or?a letter in the nature of "an order to  show cause why Brazos=20
should not declare Tenaska in default".? He answered  that it was the latter=
=2E=20
I also asked him if my recollection of how the transfer  document issue has=20
been resolved was correct and he confirmed that it was.  Hence, you only nee=
d=20
to produce a schedule showing who owns Tenaska and its  partners and what=20
options exist to acquire ownership or additional ownership  interests in=20
Tenaska and its partners. As Dan  thought that Rick would be the one to=20
prepare the schedule, he asked me to send  a copy of this email to Rick.=20
?
For your information, they would like to know how  much the new players paid=
=20
for the interests in Tenaska.
?
Pat also said that?the Limited Waiver  Agreement that I sent out this mornin=
g=20
was fine with him but that Phil had two  minor changes that I would receive=20
tomorrow. Hence, please respond to that  document tomorrow so we can get tha=
t=20
out of the way.
?
Finally, as some of you know, tomorrow I will be  sending out a draft of wha=
t=20
I hope will become an agreed upon statement of the  issues that need to be=20
resolved in order to properly analyze the damage issue. I  would appreciate =
a=20
rapid turn-around on that document.
?
While I am in Houston, I would like to meet with  Carl and Rick. If you two=20
are available, we could meet for diner on the night on  the 9th. The purpose=
=20
of the meeting is to make sure that I understand the  options available to=20
Brazos.
