Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candi=
dates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two t=
raders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have a=
lready been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders). =20

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few d=
ays to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is =
no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the even=
ing from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your=
 desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 1=
6th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.
