Gentlemen -

Following the Dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news," Dabhol is getting=
 some good news this week.

As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purpor=
ting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepr=
esented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up tim=
e vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).  However, the letter goes on to s=
tate that MSEB is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power an=
d payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum."  We are not=
 entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarificati=
on.  Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN=
 contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA.

While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects o=
f the PPA, the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on=
 the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by=
 a competent authority."  We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharas=
thra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a "how much should we pay DPC" =
determination.  If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help=
 our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.

DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in =
May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 days=
=2E  While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I be=
lieve that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to gi=
ve the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project=
 agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.
