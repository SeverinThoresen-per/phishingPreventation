I agree, unless some of them have moved from EEL to ENA or vice versa.  In t=
hat situation, we definitely want to know about it so that the docs can be a=
ssigned.  Michelle

Michelle/Diane -

Please see Michele's response below.  With her explanation of how their agre=
ements are structured, is this a relevant exercise for them to go through?

Sheila,

We have been advising Houston this week that the Comp Database is not a reli=
able source of information for our Executive Agreements - we use SAP as our =
source information system.

However, please note that we do not have separate legal employing entities i=
n the UK, for example EBS or EGM employees will always be hired on an Enron =
Europe Ltd. contract.  Therefore, all of our contracts should and do say Enr=
on Europe Ltd. or if someone is employed in a regional office the employee w=
ill be employed under the legal entity for that office.  Given this, I am no=
t sure whether the below will still be relevant - perhaps if you could let m=
e know the objective here we will know which direction to go.

As it is late in the day / week here, we will pull our own report on Monday =
and double check on this then. =20

Thanks and Regards
Michele

We have been asked by  Legal to audit all employment agreements to determine=
 if the Business Unit named in the Employment Agreement is actually the BU t=
he employee currently works for.  If the employee is now working for a diffe=
rent BU, the agreement will then be assigned to the appropriate BU.  The att=
ached is a list of EEL agreements we pulled from  the Comp Database.  Can yo=
u review these agreements and note any which should be assigned to another B=
U.  Please add any we do not have on this list.

London/Houston Legal will need to coordinate on any assignments for those th=
at have non-US based agreements.

They have asked for this info early next week.  Sorry for the short notice -=
 we just got the request today.

Please call me or Kari Oquinn if you have any questions.  Thanks for your he=
lp.

Sheila

According to the Comp DB, the EEs indicated on the attachment are EEL's empl=
oyees with Executable EE Agrmts.
