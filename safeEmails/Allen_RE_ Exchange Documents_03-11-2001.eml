Jerry,

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% =
the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an=
 interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Thank you,
=20
Phillip
