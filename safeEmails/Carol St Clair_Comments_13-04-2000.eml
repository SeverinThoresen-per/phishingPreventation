The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need t=
o=20
have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go=20
to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality=20
section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have=20
arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that=20
are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined=20
(i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case=20
"affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def o=
r=20
some other def?
