Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I=
 look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very=
 talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the sit=
uation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today. =20

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor =
-- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people inf=
ormed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs=
 done last week within the west power team.
