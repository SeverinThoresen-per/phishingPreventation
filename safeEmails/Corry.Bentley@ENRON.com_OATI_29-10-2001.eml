*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*



AGENDA:
9:00A  to 11:00A
Kevin Burns will be here from OATI to provide specifications and describe in=
 more detail the functionality of Web Trader. =20
11:30 to 2:00 PM=20
Our goal is to have representatives from the 24-Hour Group and the IT Group =
bring specific questions for Kevin.  =20
Let's determine if WebTrader can be flexible enough to replace the P&L (Delp=
hi) application, interact with Enpower, and provide a good detailed database=
 for historical information.  Most importantly, is this application fast and=
 efficient enough to add value to the 24-hour group.

Call me with any questions or to discuss.  853-0421

Thanks,

Corry
