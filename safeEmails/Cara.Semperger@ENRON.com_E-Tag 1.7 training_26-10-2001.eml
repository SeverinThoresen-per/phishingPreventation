Good Morning,

Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston.  Although=
 this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to t=
he Test site sometime in November or December.

This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each gr=
oup that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.  Also, beca=
use the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not w=
ork.  New templates will need to be created.

Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will =
work up a series of them for January and February.


Thanks,

Cara
