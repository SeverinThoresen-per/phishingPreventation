Louise,

We are thrilled that you will meet us at the Cathedral House facility and jo=
in us for the debriefing session (if you don't go into labor before tomorrow=
!). Since the rest of the group will be going to Cathedral House from the Kn=
owledge Beginnings Katy facility on the van, do you need directions to Cathe=
dral House from Enron? If not, we look forward to meeting you at Cathedral H=
ouse.=20

I have visited the Knowledge Beginnings BP facility, but since the Enron chi=
ld care center will be closer to the new Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility,=
 the Katy facility was selected as one of our tour stops.

I look forward to meeting you tomorrow!

Regards,

Charla=20

I have a few meetings on Thursday but I have already recently  visited the f=
acilities of Creme de la Creme and attended the presentation of Knowledge Be=
ginnings at Enron.   I will attend the Cathedral House facility and debriefi=
ng session.  I would suggest that you may wish to consider actually visiting=
 the BP facility which is not an open facility (company specific) as this ma=
y be more akin to what we will get.

I could give you my choice now (its easy) but I will wait until the debriefi=
ng session.

Regards

Louise

(if I go into labour before Thursday - Sarah Davis already knows my choice!)=
