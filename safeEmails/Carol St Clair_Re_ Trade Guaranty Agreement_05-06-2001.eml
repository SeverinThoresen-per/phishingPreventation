Ed:
Rudwell and I would like to talk to you about the form of Trade Guaranty
Agreement that has been sent to us.  Specifically, we need some
clarification on how Section 5 works since some new language has been added
to the June 1, 1999 form that we received.  Please call me at your
convenience to discuss this.
