Please find the following Action Items for the Tech Services team stemming f=
rom today's DASH review meeting with L. Kitchen.   Bob V. can you take point=
 on this with  D. Williams.   Mike Coleman attended the meeting in Dan's abs=
ence and can provide feedback on some of the technical discussion.

1.	Please develop a project schedule showing the inter-relationship between =
permitting, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and start-up=
 activities.  Key issues include:
	a)	ability to get equipment ordered and delivered given vendor availability
	b)	inter-play between equipment purchasing and off balance sheet financing =
requirements.
	c)	delay in construction caused by a delay in the air permit
	d)	securing a construction permit - given that site remediation has not bee=
n signed off on by the state/city
	e)	construction activities in the winter
	f)	other permits required

2.	Provide a review of the O&M budget and long term performance factors to e=
nsure we are comfortable with cost and plant performance used in the pro for=
ma.

3.	Provide an assessment of the cost/ability to put in place an EPC contract=
 to meet the pro forma assumptions (labor rates in NYC, unions, RAC requirem=
ents, etc).


As we have discussed, we need to be proactive in the DASH process and conduc=
t a technical review meeting before the DASH is written and circulated.   Th=
is will ensure that we have identified and have addressed/modeled/mitigated/=
reserved for technical issues before the DASH is submitted to EWS management=
 for signature.  Our Thursday meetings are a perfect platform for getting th=
ese issues out on the table.   This did not occur in the case of Brooklyn Na=
vy Yard, and we were left scrambling trying to answer technical questions in=
 respect of the DASH.  Much of the analysis was done, however, we need to pr=
esent a clear review of technical risks and mitigation impacts of the projec=
t.  Failing to do so puts the project at risk and creates doubt that Tech Se=
rvices has a firm grasp of the Technical Risk in ENA.  If there are issues g=
etting access to information or you are being left out of the technical anal=
ysis in compiling the DASH please let me help.

Regards,
Brian
