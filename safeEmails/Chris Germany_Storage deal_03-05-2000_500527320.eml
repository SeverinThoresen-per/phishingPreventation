Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of=20
1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection=20
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we di=
d=20
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for=20
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be=20
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

Thanks.
