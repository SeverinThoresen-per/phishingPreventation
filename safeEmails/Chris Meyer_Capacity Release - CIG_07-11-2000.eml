I spoke the Steve say this am.  I've asked him to revisit the idea of=20
allowing the WIC capacity to be re-leased to Huber as a pre-arranged deal=20
(not subject to bidding).  I think he see's my logic and will accommodate us=
;=20
however, Steve wants to run it by his regulatory people. =20

With regard to the CIG space, when Huber releases the capacity back to us, i=
t=20
looks like we will probably have to go the route of "first bidder meeting=20
minimum terms" or release the capacity on a recallable basis.  I've asked hi=
m=20
about contingencies to the bid to ensure ENA's gets the capacity.  I asked=20
him to look into a possible release scenario with a prearranged "first bidde=
r=20
meeting minimum terms" whereby, ENA has a right to match in the event a thir=
d=20
party is the "first bidder".  I don't feel real confident that CIG will allo=
w=20
this.  I follow-up when I get more info.
