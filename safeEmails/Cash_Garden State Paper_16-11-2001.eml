Eric,

As mentioned in my voice mail, Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP e=
mployment matters.  I believe that he may be better suited to answer your qu=
estions (and may have the time while I am out on vacation next week).   His =
number is 973-966-8117.   I have left him a voice mail telling him that you =
may give him a call, so he will be prepared.

I hope that is helpful.

Michelle
