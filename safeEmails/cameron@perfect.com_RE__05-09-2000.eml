The apples and apple pie sound great.  And you made with mom & dad.
Everyone probably pitched in, right?  Sounds American as...

That's scary about Annie- I guess she is OK now.

I want the huckles - I would have made a sauce with them like I was going to
do last time (but you guys forgot and made other plans with Tom & Karen).

I did not hear about the announcement - please send!!

C1 is doing a demo integration with us.  We are having a hard time getting
a
booth at their conference, but at least we will be able to announce a loose
partnership with them.

We meet with Ariba tomorrow.

How was the dome?  San Diego was beautiful!
