I've already asked Joya to give me a firm date when she knew something=20
because I was going on vacation.  Don't worry about it, I'll take care of=20
everything.  I have to fine out where to send your things first.  I wonder=20
when they'll be moving me?  Got any idea?  No one has said a word to me abou=
t=20
it at all.  It'll get done, don't worry about a thing. =20

How's everything going? =20

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to=20
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there. =20
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked=
=20
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If=
=20
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would=20
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to=20
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to=
=20
do as much as I could before I left.

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's offic=
e=20
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new=20
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out=20
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will=20
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you=
=20
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?
