Hattie, I'm with PG&E Energy Trading in Bethesda, MD. I trade cash on the
Northeast desk and will be representing PG&E at Energy Expo. I'm the only
trader going from our desk, and I would like to request an invite to your
party.

PG&E is working on several deals that will increase our Transco needs in the

future. I would like to meet the Williams folks.

My address is:

Thank you for your help!!!
