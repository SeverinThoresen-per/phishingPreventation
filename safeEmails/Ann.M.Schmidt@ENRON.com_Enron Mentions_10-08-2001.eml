DJ Enron: UK Teesside Plant May Be Offline For Several Weeks
2001-08-10 08:23 (New York)



  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Friday said its 1,875-megawatt Teess=
ide
plant in northeast England may be offline for several weeks.
  Teesside, which suffered an explosion and fire Aug. 8 that killed three
employees, must remain offline during a Health and Safety Executive
investigation which "may take several weeks to complete," Enron said in a
statement.
  "The plant remains offline and no decision on future operations will take
place for several days," it added.
  Following an investigation, Enron will have to submit a safety case for
approval before any portion of the plant may be brought back online, the Hea=
lth
and Safety Executive has said.
  The process may be complicated by the fact that there has been one previou=
s
fatal incident at Teesside.

Electric storm: Mild summer and US slowdown stave off Californian crisis

NOTHING ABOUT California's electricity crisis is turning out as expected.=20
This was supposed to be the summer of sky-high wholesale prices and non- sto=
p rolling blackouts, but they haven't happened. In fact, if you were to take=
 a tour of the Golden State now you would be hard pressed to notice there wa=
s a crisis at all: The lights are on, and everyone is still here.
That's mostly because of a fluke of nature: The weather has been uncannily m=
ild and so demand for air-conditioning and refrigeration systems, in particu=
lar, has been significantly reduced.=20
It also helps, in a perverse sort of way, that the economy has been slowing =
down, particularly the energy-guzzling hi-tech sector. Consumption fell by 1=
1 per cent in June, even before a round of retail price increases kicked in =
on 1 July, and by 5 per cent in July.=20
Contrary to dire predictions, wholesale prices have in fact been falling,=20
That's not all that has gone against expectations. We heard California's gov=
ernor, Gray Davis, and his supporters, accuse private energy generating supp=
liers of "gouging" prices; the worst of them, they said, were based in the p=
resident's home state of Texas.=20
However, power-buying statistics published last month showed that Texas comp=
anies like Enron and Dynergy had, in fact, sold California only 10 per cent =
of its electricity since the beginning of the year - much less than the Cana=
dians, say - and that the highest spot-rate prices of all had in fact been c=
harged by California-based concerns.=20
We were also told to expect a showdown between California and the federal go=
vernment. Californians, went the common wisdom, were hapless victims of a fa=
iled deregulation that had left them at the mercy of ruthless generating com=
panies; moreover, their appeals for help from the Federal Energy Regulatory =
Commission (FERC) were falling on deaf ears because the president and his ad=
visors were all in the pocket of those self-same companies.=20
This picture, too, has been complicated by recent events. Under heavy pressu=
re, FERC has reluctantly agreed to impose reasonably effective price caps, n=
ot only on California but on all the western states. At the same time, Calif=
ornia's public officials themselves have been shown to be in the pocket of e=
nergy companies.=20
Two veterans of the Gore presidential campaign brought in by Governor Davis =
recently resigned because it turned out they were simultaneously working for=
 Southern California Edison, one of the state's two giant power utilities. F=
ive other advisors were dismissed because of their personal holdings in ener=
gy stocks, while a sixth quit of his own accord. A further eight are under i=
nvestigation.=20
The conflict of interest has reached Governor Davis' press spokesman, Steve =
Maviglio, who agreed last week to sell his $12,000 (pounds 8,450) stake in a=
 California energy company, Calpine, that had been noticeably absent from hi=
s public criticisms of the "price- gougers". It has also reached the chairma=
n of the California Energy Commission, Bill Keese, who has just agreed to se=
ll more than $500,000 in energy holdings, some of them in companies that hav=
e come before him on regulatory matters.=20
Given the confusion into which the politics of the crisis has descended, it =
is tempting to look at the lights burning, both on Hollywood Boulevard and t=
he San Francisco hilltops, and conclude that there is nothing out of the ord=
inary.=20
But the crisis is far from over. "It's not over because none of the underlyi=
ng causes have been addressed," says Mark Bernstein, an energy specialist wi=
th the Rand Corporation.=20
As things stand, California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)=
, is in bank-ruptcy court, and the second-largest, Southern California Ediso=
n, is still scrambling around for ways to avoid the same fate. The state gov=
ernment has become the sole official buyer of energy, creating severe imbala=
nces in the budget and effectively putting all non-essential public programm=
es on hold. (Total energy expenditure in California is expected to reach $70=
bn this year, compared with $7bn last year, with the state picking up much o=
f the slack.) There are hopes the state could eventually withdraw from the w=
holesale market, but nobody yet knows how.=20
There is a complicated court battle going on to secure rebates from the gene=
rating companies for over-charging. The rebates could go as high as $9bn, al=
though it is not clear whether the recipients would be the utilities or the =
state. The rebates will almost certainly get sucked into PG&E's bankruptcy s=
ettlement, further complicating the issue.=20
Meanwhile, the root causes of the crisis have hardly changed: an improperly =
deregulated market with too few power sources, too little transmission infra=
structure, and a dearth of active players in a position to create a truly fr=
ee market. If nothing changes, Dr Bernstein says, the shortages, uncontrolle=
d price rises and rolling blackouts will simply be postponed until next summ=
er - or whenever the next demand crunch hits.=20
Much of the political debate has focussed on generating plants - whether loc=
al authorities have been too slow to build them, or too reluctant on environ=
mental grounds. But the state of the transmission grid is arguably a bigger =
problem, not only in California where there is a north-south bottleneck in t=
he San Joaquin Valley, but across the country. Last month, Las Vegas suffere=
d a blackout because there was no way to funnel emergency power supplies the=
re quickly enough. Since there is no direct north-south transmission line th=
rough Nevada, the power has to travel either through California (a no-go in =
the current situation) or through Utah, which was experiencing similarly hig=
h demand at the time.=20
One can anticipate similar problems in New York state and New England, where=
 the dense population makes it hard to build new transmission lines, or in F=
lorida, which has just two electric line connections to the wider United Sta=
tes, both of which were operating at capacity during last winter's peak seas=
on. Given the state's continuing population growth, it wouldn't take more th=
an a bit of freak weather or a power plant going down unexpectedly for the g=
reat electricity crisis to hit there as well.=20
"You can build as many power plants as you like, but if you don't have the g=
rid to transmit the electricity they won't do you any good," Dr Bernstein re=
marked. The White House energy plan recently unveiled focuses almost entirel=
y on energy production; not on distribution or conservation. If implemented =
in its current form by Congress, it is unlikely - energy specialists say - t=
o do much to alleviate the core US problem.=20
California's respite this Summer could well be the calm before a much wider =
storm.

The power behind the Teeside plant where three died

The Independent - London
FOREIGN

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

UNTIL TUESDAY'S explosion that killed three people at its Teesside power sta=
tion - the third died yesterday - the public profile in this country of the =
US energy company Enron was pretty low.=20
The $100bn firm owns Wessex Water but lacks the consumer recognition of othe=
r high-profile energy operators such as Exxon, Shell and BP.
But, behind the scenes in high political circles, Enron is extremely well kn=
own. It is a company that gives the appearance of securing what it wants - e=
ither here, such as when the Labour Government came to office vowing not to =
allow any more new private gas-fired power stations, only to relent in Enron=
's case on Teesside, or in the US, where the firm is the best connected of a=
ny to the new President, George Bush. Or even in India, where, despite enorm=
ous public hostility, it was the driving force behind plans for a massive po=
wer station that was built at Dabhol, near Bombay.=20
In India, Amnesty International compiled a report on the tactics used by the=
 local contractors building the power station to get their own way. It makes=
 for graphic reading: Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar was in her bathroom at five =
in the morning when several male police officers entered her house and start=
ed beating sleeping members of her family. Mrs Bhalekar, 24, and pregnant, w=
as then dragged from the house into the road and struck on the back with pol=
ice batons. She said: "My one-and-a-half-year-old daughter desperately held =
on to me but the police kicked her away."=20
She was targeted by the police because her husband, Baba, was a leader of th=
ose who were protesting against the building of the plant.=20
Villagers complained they would be overcharged for their electricity, while =
there were allegations of corruption involving state officials. Local people=
 were also displaced and concerns were raised about environmental damage.=20
Local constructors paid the state government for the hire of reserve police =
to protect the site but, in a damning study, Amnesty found the police engage=
d in a systematic campaign of mass arrests and unprovoked assaults. Amnesty =
called on the US companies building the plant to safeguard human rights and =
to establish guidelines for all security personnel at the site.=20
Amnesty's report - the only one ever produced by the organisation into a com=
mercial project, as opposed to a government - was published in July 1997. Th=
e main US company, with an 80 per cent share in the Dabhol plant, was Enron.=
=20
Yet in Britain, little more than a year later at the 1998 Labour conference,=
 Enron was able to pay pounds 15,000 to sponsor the party's gala dinner. In =
all, Enron has given pounds 27,500 to Labour's cause.=20
When Labour came to power in 1997, there was little prospect, seemingly, of =
the company's hoped-for Teesside plant going ahead. The Tories had pursued a=
 "dash for gas" policy; Labour, out of a residual support for Britain's coal=
 industry, voiced its opposition. But, within two years, Enron received a sp=
ecial exemption to build at Teesside. By November last year, Labour was righ=
t behind the "dash for gas". Stephen Byers, the Trade Secretary at the time,=
 lifted the ban completely, thereby consenting to another Enron project on t=
he Isle of Grain in Kent.=20
In the world of energy and political lobbying, Enron is king. Simon McRae, o=
f Friends of the Earth, said: "When you look at their influence in Governmen=
t- policy making, in areas like climate change, they know how to throw their=
 weight around."=20
Determined to succeed in Britain, the firm hired the political lobbying orga=
nisation, GJW. One of GJW's employees subsequently boasted to an undercover =
journalist how he would ensure Enron would overcome the Government ban on pr=
ivate gas-fired stations. "The way you go about it is that you play on the e=
xisting prejudices within the Cabinet for coal, you play on the existing pre=
judices within the Cabinet for competition, and you play the forces off agai=
nst each other. It's intimate knowledge of what's going on that produces res=
ults in the end."=20
The lobbyist did well and Enron got its power stations. The company continue=
s to wield influence. This year, it was one of a select group of businesses =
to accompany Nick Raynsford, the government minister, on a trade mission to =
Egypt. Ralph Hodge, Enron's European head, has been awarded a CBE for "servi=
ces to the power generation and gas industries."=20
Relatively obscure here it may be, but Enron touches us all our lives. In th=
e US, the company was the biggest backer of George Bush. Its chairman, Kenne=
th Lay, is widely supposed to be one of the new president's energy advisers.=
 Mr Bush is under pressure to reveal the identities of his behind- the-scene=
s team and it would be a shock if Mr Lay is not one of them: his company eve=
n vetted applicants for jobs on the commission regulating the US energy mark=
et. The Enron chairman is thought to have also played a key role in the shoc=
k decision by Mr Bush to drop the Kyoto global warming accord and to persuad=
e him to open up the hitherto protected Alaskan arctic wilderness to energy =
exploration.

AUSTRALIA: Pacific Hydro seeks 75MW wind farm approval.

MELBOURNE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Power generator Pacific Hydro Ltd said on Frid=
ay it had lodged planning applications for a 75 megawatt wind farm at Buango=
r in western Victoria, but the project hinged on development of local turbin=
e manufacturing.=20
The company last month opened the 18.3 MW Codrington wind farm on Victoria's=
 west coast. Its proposed 150 MW to 200 MW Portland Wind Energy Project is a=
waiting environmental approval.
Pacific Hydro said it had invited tenders from four wind turbine companies t=
o begin Australian manufacturing if its Portland proposal cleared the approv=
als process.=20
"Since we started building the Codrington wind farm the Australian dollar de=
valued about 15 percent so the economics of importing has changed," Pacific =
Hydro managing director Jeff Harding told Reuters.=20
"Our Portland project presents a project of sufficient size to justify local=
 manufacturing."=20
Companies short-listed to set up Australian wind turbine manufacturing are E=
nron Corp , Vestas Wind Systems , NEG Micon and Bonus.=20
Harding said it was hoped the Portland project would clear government regula=
tory approvals by early next year.=20
"We hope to have construction start on the Portland wind farm project by the=
 middle of next year," he said.=20
Clearance of the Portland project would pave the way for the company to move=
 ahead with the Challicum Hills Wind Farm project at Buangor.=20
Harding said the company had lodged a town planning application with the Ara=
rat Council and it was hoped the project could begin in 2003.=20
A number of companies are looking at building wind farms, particularly in Au=

Enron willing to sell Dahbol stake to India

Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

The Houston energy giant is finally willing to sell its 65% stake in the tro=
ubled power company to the Indian government in exchange for the money it in=
vested in the project.=20
After weeks of rumors, innuendo and scattershot comments by executives, Hous=
ton energy giant Enron Corp. finally made it official Aug.9: The company is =
willing to sell its 65% stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Co. to the Indian=
 government in exchange for the money it had invested in the project.
"In the interest of quickly resolving this dispute, Enron has expressed a wi=
llingness to forgo expected profits and negotiate terms that would allow the=
 Indian authorities to acquire the foreign stakeholders' interests in DPC," =
Enron said in a written statement.=20
Enron insisted, however, that it and co investors General Electric Co. and B=
echtel, which each own 10%, recoup all that they had invested in the $2.9 bi=
llion project.=20
"Enron and its partners would still need to recover 100% of their costs," th=
e statement continued. "The company is willing to take this step and forgo s=
ignificant profits on its investment if the dispute can be resolved amicably=
 with full recovery of our costs in the near term."=20
Press reports have pegged Enron's investment at $1 billion. Enron spokesman =
Johan Zaayman wouldn't disclose how much Enron and its partners had invested=
 in the $2.9 billion project.=20
"We are seeking to sell the equity we've invested in the project, but we're =
not talking about any specific amounts yet," he said. "It's too early."=20
John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, figures Enron ha=
s invested about $875 million in equity in the facility.=20
"I call them 'innocents abroad,'" he said. "They didn't know boo about what =
they were getting into. In India, you can't win, you can't get even and you =
can't even get out of the game."=20
Enron and Dabhol's primary customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=
, which owns 15% of the project, have been locked in a bitter dispute since =
April over investment, payment and pricing issues.=20
Enron has charged MSEB with failing to invest in the project's second phase =
and defaulting on $45 million in electricity payments.=20
MSEB countered that Dabhol's electricity prices were too high. It stopped bu=
ying power from the facility in May.=20
Enron's sale of its stake in the project would be a big blow to India. It is=

India: Dabhol Power goes to PM with equity sale offer

NEW DELHI, Aug. 9. AFTER failing to elicit the support of both the Power and=
 Finance Ministries for a buyout of its troubled project by Central utilitie=
s, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has approached the Prime Minister, Mr A.B.=
 Vajpayee, with a similar proposal, according to top sources.=20
In a letter to the Prime Minister, DPC has offered to sell its equity in the=
 project to the Government for $1 billion on a no-profit no-loss basis.
Interestingly, when contacted, DPC chief, Mr Wade Cline, told Business Line =
that 'a private letter' to this effect had been recently sent to "the Power =
and Finance Ministry representatives." Mr Kline clarified that so far no com=
pany has approached them for buying out their stake in DPC.=20
The Union Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, however, maintained that the Pow=
er Ministry had not received any such communication. The Power and Finance M=
inistries have been of the view that their role in resolving the issue would=
 be restricted to finding buyers for phase II of the power project which has=
 a capacity of 1,415 MW.=20
Even as DPC has knocked at the doors of the PMO, the lenders to the project =
are at present talking to the stakeholders - MSEB, DPC and the Centre- for r=
educing the tariff so as to find buyers for the power from the second phase.=
=20
Informally, the Centre has been consulted on the possible revenue losses if =
the duty on the LNG terminal is waived. This is likely to be of the order of=
 around Rs 300 crore. The other variable is the transmission charges for tra=
nsfer of power to the neighbouring purchasing states.=20
As per the counter-guarantee agreement between the Centre, State and the DPC=
, which alone binds the Centre contractually, the Centre's liability is rest=
ricted to payment of outstanding energy bills of DPC (for past power sale to=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board) and payment of foreign debt up to $300=
 million.=20
The sequence of events leading up to the DPC communique to the Prime Ministe=
r are worth recalling.=20
Sometime in March this year, the company had informally sent a proposal to t=
he Government to sell its equity in the project for $1 billion.=20
The report published in this paper was, however, denied.=20
On June 9 this year, when Enron worldwide chief, Mr Kenneth Lay, met with th=
e Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, his proposal to the Centre to buyout the=
 project was again shot down. Further, the Enron chief's request to meet wit=
h the Prime Minister did not fructify.=20
Now, nearly two months later, the company has sent a proposal directly to th=
e Prime Minister, seeking his intervention for the Centre to buyout the proj=
ect for $1 billion.=20
In Parliament, meanwhile, the Union Minister of State for Power, Ms Jayawant=
iben Mehta, stated that the Government does not propose to buy out the DPC's=
 equity-holding in the project.=20

India's Prabhu on Enron's Offer to Sell India Project: Comment
2001-08-09 22:13 (New York)


     Mumbai, Aug. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Indian Power Minister Suresh
Prabhu speaks on Enron Corp.'s offer to the government to buy out
its $3 billion power project in the country at cost.
     Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co, which runs the $3
billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. General
Electric Capital and the closely held Bechtel group together own
20 percent of the company.

     ``There's no point in making an offer to the government. Was
it (the offer) a part of the contract?'' between Dabhol and the
state board. ``A seller has to find a buyer.''
     Still, the government will help resolve the seven-month old
payment dispute, Prabhu said.
     ``We will facilitate an early solution to the problem, and to
the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned. We are not
washing our hands off it.
     ``We have taken number of steps towards reduction of tariff.
I can't give you an absolute number right now as it depends on
variables like fuel costs, capacity utilization. Even lenders have
agreed to lower rates. We are working on the number.''

     Enron wants to exit the venture, as it is owed $64 million by
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only customer, in
unpaid bills. The board in May stopped buying power, saying it's
too expensive.
     Enron said it has invested $875 million in the project. The
plant can generate 740 megawatts of power and Dabhol had planned
to add another 2,184 megawatts of capacity this year.
