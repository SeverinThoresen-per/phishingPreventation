I appreciate the succinct summary and lead time and we will get our thoughts=

to you on Friday.----cgy

Subject: Forward Index Position

We potentially have a huge exposure associated with forward index sales in=20
California.  If the FERC implements a "soft cap" then the index that they=20
post will not exceed this "soft cap" even if the PX (for PX markets) or the=20
ISO (for the ex post market) buys a material quantity of energy above the=20
"soft cap" price.  The FERC is likely to implement either a $100 or $150=20
"soft cap."  Let's say the FERC implements a $100 "soft cap."  It is likely=20
that there would be 20,000 MW of demand at that price and perhaps 5,000 MW o=
f=20
supply (I made these numbers up).  I am not sure how the PX would allocate=20
its scarce supply -- a logical way would be pro rata which means that each=20
buyer would be awarded 25% of its bid.  So let's say we were short 100 MW of=
=20
index and went to buy it back from the PX each day.  We would have to submit=
=20
bids for 400 MW in hopes of getting 100 MW.  Eventually buyers would bid for=
=20
many multiples of their load, driving demand up while supply remains fixed=20
thus lowering the percentage that each buyer receives.  To fix this problem,=
=20
the PX could limit the amount that you could bid for in their market based o=
n=20
how much load you serve.  EES might argue that they can bid since it is thei=
r=20
load.  Long story short -- their are lots of ways for this to explode into a=
=20
big problem for us and only a few ways for things to turn out fine.

Here's what I'd like to do.  First, I would like to get a download of all=20
Index Forward deals currently on the books for delivery starting in January=20
of 2001.  I want to see all important deal attributes in a spreadsheet.  I=20
think that the result of this process will be that we are short up to a=20
couple of hundred MW of index power in California over the next two years. =20
Bob Badeer will lead that effort.  Then, I need to understand what our legal=
=20
position is with respect to the FERC, ISO, and PX redefining the index.  Do=20
our contracts give us an out if the index materially changes in a way so tha=
t=20
it no longer reflects a competitive market clearing price where supply and=20
demand balance?  Christian Yoder should be the point person on that effort. =
=20
Thanks for your help on this matter.  I will be out of the office on=20
Wednesday, Thursday, and most of Friday.  I would like some answers to this,=
=20
to the extent that anwers are knowable on the legal side, by Friday.
