Gentlemen:

1.  I have spoken with David Best about the difficulty Paul Henking has=20
encountered so far with getting any agreement from Mitsubishi to delay both=20
the joint survey/testing and arbitration in hopes of a settlement.  As I=20
understand Paul's suggestion, Paul wants to switch fronts and press our carg=
o=20
underwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves (Paul, if I=
=20
have misstated your strategy, please let me know).  I understand from Paul's=
=20
e-mail that he does not think Mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration an=
d=20
joint testing.

Unfortunately, while we want to consider all options, neither David nor I=20
think that this approach will succeed.  We believe that our cargo=20
underwriter's response to our claim will be that they, too, want us to=20
proceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on=20
this claim.  We should also all recall that ECT performed a pre-sale survey=20
of product from the same location that was off-spec.  Although we do not=20
think that either Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that=
=20
survey, such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both=20
proceedings.  Last, until at least the joint testing has been done, I think=20
that the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured;=20
i.e., to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claims.

Of particular note, Steve Jones, our expert chemist, has notified us that th=
e=20
samples taken for joint testing have a shelf-life that may be coming to an=20
end in the near future.  If the samples begin to "turn" before the joint=20
testing has taken place, the delay of the testing could be used against us i=
n=20
the arbitration.  Parenthetically, it also appears that a representative of=20
the shipowner's P&I club wants to be involved in the testing.  It may be tha=
t=20
Mitsubishi, as the vessel's charterer, has placed the head owner on notice o=
f=20
our claim against Mitsubishi, and of Mitsubishi's potential claim for=20
indemnification against the head owner.

Under the circumstances, David and I agree that we should get the joint=20
testing scheduled and done as soon as possible.

2. David and I have also spoken about Paul's idea of advancing payment to=20
Mitsubishi for the freight claim of $760,000, and agreeing to revert to=20
Mitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of November.  I assume=20
that Paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the=20
$250,000 demurrage claim at or near that time, and that all these amounts=20
would be paid on a "without prejudice" basis; i.e., that ECT could later=20
pursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against Mitsubishi.

The obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage=20
for bringing Mitsubishi to the bargaining table, but Mitsubishi has resisted=
=20
that leverage so far.  We are very exposed to advance payment of freight and=
=20
demurrage, subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully=
=20
assert that the ship was at fault.  By paying now, we can avoid the=20
attorneys' fees (and, hopefully, some or all of the interest) that would go=20
with an interim award to Mitsubishi.  I have not been advised of any=20
anticipated problem with getting Mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitratio=
n=20
award should ECT be successful in proving its contamination claim and=20
recouping the freight and demurrage paid. =20

Under these  difficult circumstances, both David and I agree with Paul's=20
suggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front, without prejudice=
,=20
but only after we have informally discussed this on a solictor-to-solicitor=20
basis, so that there is no misunderstanding of ECT's intent to pursue the=20
contamination claim, and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other=20
concessions extracted that we can think of.  This will prevent Mitsubishi=20
from dragging its feet after we make this payment. =20

3.  David and I have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this=20
single-arbitrator proceeding.  He and Neale agree that using a Q.C. would=20
give us the best shot at a well-thought-through legal opinion, and here, our=
=20
best argument may be simply to argue that Mitsubishi has not borne its legal=
=20
burden to provide a cargoworthy ship.  Based on David and Neale's suggestion=
,=20
I have asked David to approach Mitsubishi's solicitors on an informal basis=20
to discuss three Q.Cs that David and Neale find acceptable, and determine=20
whether Mitsubishi's solicitors also find them acceptable.  Once that occurs=
,=20
I will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single=20
arbitrator.  That should hopefully occur today or tomorrow.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt
