Subject: PG&E Questions


My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is=20
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling=20
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re th=
e=20
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever=20
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been=
=20
executed, but has been "put on the shelf" awaiting decision on successful=20
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder=
=20
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the=
=20
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder fo=
r=20
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If=20
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the=20
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.  =20



* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to=20
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern=20
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to=20
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period. =20
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce=
=20
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the=
=20
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has=20
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelmin=
g=20
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will=20
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson=20
Act cancellation fee.
