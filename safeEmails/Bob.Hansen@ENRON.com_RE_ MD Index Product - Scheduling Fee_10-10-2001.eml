Bob,

I think that for the moment the $0.25/MWh for the scheduling fee component i=
s fine to utilize.  Michelle is in the process of reviewing all BGE scheduli=
ng requirements and within the next few days should have be able to determin=
e the accuracy of the $0.25/MWh scheduling fee component.

Richard

Good Morning....

As a placeholder, Narsimha previously suggested $0.25/MWH for the scheduling=
 fee component of the fixed "Management Fee".  Do you think this is still a =
reasonable number to use?  If so, we would use it in our notional estimates,=
 and Deal Management would use the same value for executable pricing.  =20

Thanks!
Bob
