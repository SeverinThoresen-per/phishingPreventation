I have been talking with Partho from the weather derivative group.  The prem=
ium from the first transaction that we discussed a couple weeks ago was proh=
ibitive to doing the deal (ie, a $8.3 million cost for only a $12 million pa=
yout).  I wanted to see if we could sit down and talk about this again becau=
se the hedge may actually be appropriate, but we may need to further refine =
our assumptions (how many days we expect to be paid on, what is a realistic =
temperature, ect.)  in order to get a value that is realistic.  Let me know =
if this time works for you guys.

Laura,
Could you please get a room for this meeting.
Thanks,
JD
