John:

Fred Mitro and I just got off the phone with Duncan Croasdale at Enron Canad=
a regarding the 11N1s. He indicated that, although nothing has been signed y=
et, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger=
) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.

Duncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada's books for US$38 mi=
llion, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.

I am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Boo=
th in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending G=
E7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these un=
its. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants u=
s to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them=
=2E We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on direct=
ly.

Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.

Regards,

Ben
