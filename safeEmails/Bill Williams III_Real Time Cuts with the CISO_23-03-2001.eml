Group,

When importing/exporting or wheeling energy through California, it is=20
important that the schedule ID is included in the inc or service sheet. =20
Further, if an import/export or wheel is cut real-time (ie. over the phone=20
after hour ahead finals are out), an email should be sent to volume=20
management and such cuts or other occurrences should be noted in your day or=
=20
night notes.  This information along with the real-time tag number allows=20
other members of the West Desk (and those following you on shift) to do thei=
r=20
job quickly and more accurately.  I understand that many of you are working=20
long shifts and combating systems issues at the same time.  However, it is=20
not acceptable to delay members of other groups because of a failure to=20
communicate information readily available to us.

To make sure we are clear on this, the expectations are as follows:
     =20
 AN ORGANIZED AND COMPLETE INC/SERVICE SHEET AT START END OF SHIFT WITH=20
SCHEDULE ID'S AND RT TAG #'S
 AN EMAIL TO VOLUME MANAGEMENT CONCERNING RT CUTS ON RT IMPORTS/EXPORTS AND=20
WHEELS
 COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF THE DAYS EVENTS IN THE DISCUSSION NOTES

An inability to communicate with volume management or settlements is a=20
performance issue.  I already receive reports on disputes and deal entry=20
errors.  In addition, I will be asking volume management and settlements to=20
provide feedback on each trader during the review process.

Thanks,
Bill
