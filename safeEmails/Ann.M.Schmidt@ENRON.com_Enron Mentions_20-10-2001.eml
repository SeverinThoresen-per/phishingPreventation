Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment)=20
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses=
 on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was roc=
ked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership t=
hat was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer.=20
The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per sha=
re, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reporte=
d a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over fou=
r years.=20
Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street J=
ournal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chie=
f Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partners=
hip that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron.=20
"I don't think this thing passes the smell test," said one analyst who spoke=
 on condition of anonymity. "I think the CFO should be out of there right no=
w. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone," he said.=20
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the=
 arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier=
 this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual=
 responsibilities.=20
POOR JUDGMENT?=20
Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment b=
y senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with inve=
stors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminat=
ed with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling i=
n August.=20
"For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these que=
stions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors," said Co=
mmerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It points to poor decision-making=
 on behalf of the board and top management at Enron," he said.=20
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electrici=
ty, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a =
gain of 87 percent.=20
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build=
 a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline =
Internet energy trading platform.=20
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadban=
d and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, a=
nd the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payme=
nts dispute.=20
Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of E=
nron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after E=
nron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduce=
d valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water =
services.=20
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain inves=
tment grade credit ratings.=20
Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent r=
eports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant s=
urprises may lie ahead.=20
"What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?" =
asked one frustrated analyst. "We don't know if it's limited to this," he sa=

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating
By Michael Rieke

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocke=
ting share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecom=
munications business.
Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telec=
om.=20
The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million befor=
e interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the t=
hird quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 mill=
ion.=20
Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring it=
s broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included sev=
erance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the red=
uced value of Enron's content services.=20
At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay s=
aid the broadband business is "not that robust" right now. Industry revenue =
is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, "more t=
han even we anticipated," Lay said.=20
The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for band=
width trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated poten=
tial trading partners.=20
"A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into," he said. "Oth=
ers thought so, too."=20
Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less =
capital, Lay said. It spent "too much too soon."=20
An Ominous Comparison=20

He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business =
with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those w=
ho still have broadband jobs at Enron.=20
Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadba=
nd in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-las=
ting headache than broadband.=20
Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that La=
y told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play i=
n telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recove=
rs.=20
It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 m=
illion a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It c=
ould cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business.=20
Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom bus=
iness it wants to be in, he said.=20
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the c=
ompany needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs.=20
At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network asset=
s as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they "wouldn't want to forever be in t=
he network business."=20
Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay =
said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company h=
as talked about exchanging fiber and other assets.=20
The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broad=
band intermediation. "Intermediation" is a term the company uses in most of =
its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of t=
rading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers.=20
More Bad News Expected=20

Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrich=
s Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quart=
er.=20
"If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen,=
 you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly," Foll=
owill told Bandwidth Beat. "I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in br=
oadband."=20
Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more=
 broadband writedowns from Enron. "To the extent that they can take more wri=
tedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it."=20
He predicted "a $200 million haircut" in the first quarter of next year beca=
use of a goodwill valuation issue.=20
And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broa=
dband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They h=
ad another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories an=
d working capital items.=20
Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron.=20
"I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a =
key sector in their reporting," she said.=20
Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she sa=
id. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's ear=
nings within the next three years.=20
She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy.=20
The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. =
"It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest," he said. "They'l=
l carry the trading operation to some degree."=20

Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For Trading
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck W=
atson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth s=
ector has reached its bottom and is recovering.=20
But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow J=
ones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the busi=
ness world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.
In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the botto=
m in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begi=
n recovery in the fourth quarter of this year.=20
Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operati=
ons to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natu=
ral or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said.=20
Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video confer=
encing.=20
Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any =
signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, be=
cause there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said.=20
"They're trying to find trading partners for broadband," Watson said. "That'=
s going to be tough to do." Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading =
because there isn't "a realistic model" for it yet, he said. "I said two yea=
rs ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least =
two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity."=20
The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building w=
ill create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade =
bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said.=20
It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is t=
he dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model include=
s telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply=
 of bandwidth.=20
Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past seve=
ral months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal=
 has been to build a customer base. "We're looking at being an intermediary,=
 and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today."=20
Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading de=
sk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth=
 from others. "I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requir=
ements," Watson said.=20
He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. "The=
y have offices that never talked to each before," he said. "Now they've got =
to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Te=
xaco is pretty reasonable."=20
ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and =
ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which include=
s natural gas and gas liquids.=20
The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's tel=
ecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. =
In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the seco=
nd quarter.=20
Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small=
 loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter.=20
"If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need re=
ally," he said. "If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very h=
appy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself."=20
Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy.=20
"Dynegy is an energy company," he said. "Our energy merchant company is doin=
g very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is no=
t our core business by any stretch right now. But I'd love to be able to tel=
l you it's going to be. I'd love to be able to tell you it is someday."=20

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.
By Amanda Cooper

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of he=
dge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchang=
e members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cu=
ts.=20
The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has pr=
ompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casti=
ng a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.
Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raisin=
g questions about the prospects for those now seeking work.=20
"Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the=
 company has a budget to hire," Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment gro=
up Exchange Consulting said.=20
"Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting bu=
dgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an =
awful lot of redundancies."=20
Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key =
ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on=
 the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys =
and clerks.=20
Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New Yo=
rk base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but =
20 base metals staff were laid off in the process.=20
In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it plan=
ned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cu=
t 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group .=20
SECURITY=20
With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divis=
ions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will i=
ntensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security.=20
"What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders =
with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous=
 about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put," Gilley said.=20
"So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record wou=
ld have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now =
staying for three to five years.=20
"They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're wel=
l recognised and not going to stick their necks out," she said.=20
BONUS FEARS=20
October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market =
in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and con=
ferences=20
Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bon=
uses, which are usually announced at the end of the year.=20
"Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of yea=
r, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them ar=
e anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job," Sia=
n Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said.=20
LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful =
hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as =
hi-tech and telecomms stocks.=20
Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to f=
ocus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for t=
he jobs market.=20
Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditiona=
l practices of trading physical metal.=20
"A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are =
now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical mark=
et and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, " Gilley said.=20
"The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few y=
ears ago is marketing," she added.=20
As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is se=
emingly undimmed.=20
"Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche," o=
ne trader said.

New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate

10/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet it=
s prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement w=
ith Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a m=
aster netting agreement.=20
In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact an=
d cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct busines=
s until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.
The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $=
65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share.=20
Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to=
 Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
Third quarter revenue will be "slightly lower" than the $60 million to $65 m=
illion forecast in August, New Power said.=20

In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18=
=2E19 million.=20
The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp.=
, Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the mast=
er cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands throug=
h Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the =
Enron units.=20
Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be i=
n the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of no=
t more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, =
valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million=
 limit for October 2001.=20
Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67,=
 up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average dail=
y volume is 223,800 shares.=20
