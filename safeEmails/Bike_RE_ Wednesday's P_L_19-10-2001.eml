Mike:  Everything in the P/L looks good to me.  I have attached the cover sh=
eet and the reconciliation.  The estimate was off on the gas daily curve shi=
ft because Monte Lost connection to Randy's files. This meant that on the es=
timate, the liquidated day was incorrect.  When I run it, we are much closer=
 (within $20,000), but this is not the # you went home with.  This issue wil=
l be resolved tomorrow ensuring that the estimate will be more accurate. =20

The next largest item on the reconciliation is the transport model.  There i=
s not one deal that stands out as the culprit.  I need to do some more inves=
tigating as to how to improve the transport model estimate.  It may be disco=
unting.  The curves and the spreads are all accurate.


The status of the three items we discussed today are:=20

1. I am working away at the new deal model.  Kieth and I are in agreement as=
 to the basic form.
2. I gave you the broker report.; and
3.  Jeff is working with confirmations to get you both the broker confirms a=
nd our confirms so that you can sign off on them.
3a. I am also working on the desk to desk physical report.  I was unable to =
run the report I initially had in mind.  I will let you know.

I am trying very hard to provide the information you need in a timely accura=
te fashion.  If you have any suggestions as to how Monte and I can improve, =
please tell me.

See you tomorrow.

Anne
