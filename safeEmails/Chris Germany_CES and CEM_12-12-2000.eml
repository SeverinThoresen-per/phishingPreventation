I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energ=
y=20
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know)=20
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM=20
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and=20
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??
