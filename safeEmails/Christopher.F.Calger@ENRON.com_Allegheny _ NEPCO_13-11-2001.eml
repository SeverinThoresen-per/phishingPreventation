The "bid" is for an EPC Contract with the equipment.  The implied bid for th=
e equipment is -$16.7MM.  The implied margin in the EPC Contract is $32MM pl=
us $11MM of contingency.  If the risk/reward on the EPC contract is reasonab=
le, then this seems like a great deal.  At the same time, we will attach a T=
urbine LOI to the EPC LOI making it clear to Allegheny that we can offer the=
 turbines on a stand alone basis.   Should we offer at the $10MM discount or=
 are you OK with -$16.7MM?  Ben and I would hit a -$16.7MM bid.    This woul=
d probably close this in January, but we ould try to get a turbine down paym=
ent in December.
