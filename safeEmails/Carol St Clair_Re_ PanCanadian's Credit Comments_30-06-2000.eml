Carol,

In response to the comments PanCanadian has with out ISDA;

1)  I can live with excluding obligations with Affilates, if it is defined=20
this way in the Canadian Master.  Although I would like to know your thought=
s=20
on this.

2) The Minimum Transfer amount must remain ar $1.00

3) I can agree to the rounding of $100,000 for both counterparty's.

4) I will agree to the L/C Bank to be either a major US or Canadian Bank.

5) I can not remove the current ratio trigger, this company is a marketing=20
company with large current assets and liabilities and this is a way to=20
monitor the company's balance of receivables to payables.

Please call with questions

Russell

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be=
=20
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.
