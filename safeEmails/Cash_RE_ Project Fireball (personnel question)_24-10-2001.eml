Michelle,

The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from V=
ulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.    In this scena=
rio, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of =
the deal.   A few things:

In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enro=
n would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 =
year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the mark=
eting rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call th=
ese employees.  George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am no=
t sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer let=
ter, etc.

Thanks,
Shanna
