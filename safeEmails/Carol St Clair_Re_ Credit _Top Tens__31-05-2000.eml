Tanya:
We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial sid=
e=20
would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no=20
reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does no=
t=20
cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective.  =20
Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referrin=
g=20
to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their=20
counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective=20
until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her=
=20
alos about getting the Guaranty.
