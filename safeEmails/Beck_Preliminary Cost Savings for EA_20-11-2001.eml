=46rom our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the busi=
ness, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels),=
 our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total=20
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather p=
ositions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estima=
te and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performe=
rs across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this we=
ekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could pote=
ntially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for=
 those two business units. =20

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, =
which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and a=
ny systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate al=
so did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that m=
ay result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter. =
=20

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompa=
tible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.=
