Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.
