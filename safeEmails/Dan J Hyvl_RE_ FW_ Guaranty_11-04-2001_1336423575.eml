Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP=

who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties,=20
Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please=
=20
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one=
=20
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amoun=
t=20
that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at=20
