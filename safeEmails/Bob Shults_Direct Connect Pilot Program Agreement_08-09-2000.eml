Mark Taylor and I reviewed the subject agreement and have some general=20
comments.

Given the agreement is between EBS and the outside counterparties we would=20
like to eliminate any mention of EnronOnline (the only place were we feel it=
=20
may be necessary is in the failover article IV).   EBS has the EIN which can=
=20
be used as an alternative to the Internet and the customer has agreed to use=
=20
such alternative.
The term can be month to month with thirty days written notice by either=20
party.  No need to mention EnronOnline or the pilot program.=20
Can we make this agreement much more customer friendly?  This appears to be=20
an agreement that you use with customers who are being guranteed a certain=20
level of service (as evidenced by the reference to ePowered Content in=20
Article XIII).  We would like to keep the agreement focused on access to=20
facility, letter of authorization and the interconnect order if possible.   =
I=20
understand that you are commiting to EnronOnline a certain level of service=20
which is predicated upon your ability to get assurances from our customers=20
however we should deal with that in our agreement if necessary.
What is the extent of the equiptment that we will be housing at the=20
facilities?  If it is limited this would give us another opportunity to=20
reduce the scope of the contract.

Lets discuss tomorrow and see if we can get this wrapped up.  Lorraine will=20
schedule.  Thanks
