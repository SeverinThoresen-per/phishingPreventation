John, just wanted to give you a heads up that I will be calling you tomorrow=
 once our curves are loaded from today.  As of today, we show that NewPower'=
s exposure stands at approximately $66MM now that May business has rolled of=
f.  Of course, we do have your $20MM cash collateral and the $15MM collatera=
l threshold, but that still leaves us about $31MM short.  I have looked and =
it appears that approximately $14MM of the exposure is related to June Gas S=
ales to NewPower.  We will probably need to have you prepay June gas and pos=
t cash or an LC for the remainder based on what tomorrows report shows.  I w=
ill be in touch by late morning to discuss how to resolve.  Thanks.
