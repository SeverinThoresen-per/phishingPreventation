Hallo Jeff,

the Plant index number is a number generated by the Paradox database engine.
It is not an information from the PLC.
=20
First point: This number is not available on the ParkPC at the moment. (But=20
that can be changed)

Second point: For your database you want to use an information of an other=20
database system.
You depend on the correct work of the other database system.
If you have consecutive numbers you only know that you have the same=20
information as the local paradox database.
You can not be sure that you have every single error message from the PLC,=20
because the PLC error messages have no index number.

I think the plant index number is only needed if you import external data in=
=20
the SQL database.

Comments and results?

Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of=
=20
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having=20
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence b=
y=20
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In=20
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for eac=
h=20
turbine ID and status message. =20

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status=20
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be=20
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in=
=20
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?

Jeff Duff
