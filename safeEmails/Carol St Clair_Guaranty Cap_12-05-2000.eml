Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty.=
 =20
The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time=20
when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the=20
date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that=20
results in its exposure being above the threshold.
