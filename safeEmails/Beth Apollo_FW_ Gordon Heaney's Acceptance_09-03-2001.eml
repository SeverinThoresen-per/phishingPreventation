Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with=
=20
various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I=20
just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on=20
Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited=20
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit=20
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that=20
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed. =20

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin=20
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our=
=20
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all=20
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no=20
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or=20
should be more involved. =20

Augustin/Jaime,

I just wanted to let you know that Gordon has accepted our offer to take on=20
the new position supporting your trading organization.  He is very excited=20
and looks forward to working with you both. =20

We are going to work on a transition period for him.  He is currently=20
finishing a project on Paper and Pulp settlements to automate those=20
processes.  He would like to finish this process before he takes on his new=20
assignment full time.  He anticipates the completion of the automation to be=
=20
within the next few weeks.  In the meantime we will work on having him=20
cross-train for his new responsibilities.

Please let me know of any questions that you have.
