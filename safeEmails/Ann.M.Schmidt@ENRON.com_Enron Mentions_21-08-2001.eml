Blockbuster is giving Hollywood a taste of its own hardball tactics.=20
It was the shot heard around Hollywood: In an otherwise routine earnings con=
ference call in July, Blockbuster ChiefExecutive Officer John Antioco casual=
ly mentioned that the 7,781-store video chain might end some of its rental r=
evenue-sharing programs so popular with the studios.
Hollywood had already heard rumblings that Blockbuster wanted to modify the =
deals that force it to buy the studios' clunkers as well as their hits. But =
it was the first time that Antioco, 51, had gone public with his plans. "Sha=
ring No More,"screamed Variety the next day. For Hollywood, the move is akin=
 to killing the industry's golden goose:Since Antioco first negotiated the d=
eals in 1997, Blockbuster's sales have jumped 14% compounded annually, reach=
ing $4.9 billion last year. The studios have raked it in, too, collecting 40=
% of videotape revenues--an average of $25 to $30 per tape--while consumers =
have benefited from a wider selection.=20
Under the old system, rental stores bought tapes up front for $65 each, and =
got an exclusive rental window. The effect was that the stores under-ordered=
, hurting consumers, stores and moviemakers.=20
By speaking out, Antioco put the studios on the defensive. "It's unfortunate=
 that they would say that in a public way instead of privately," seethes one=
 studio executive. Blockbuster is "an endangered species," warns Warren Lieb=
erfarb, president of AOLTime Warner's Warner Home Entertainment division.=20
Antioco takes the criticism in stride. After rescuing Blockbuster from a dea=
th spiral since arriving from Taco Bell in 1997, he has turned the tables on=
 Hollywood and put the company squarely in the middle of the debate over the=
 future distribution of movies. Whereas there was talk as recently as the be=
ginning of the year that movies-on-demand and other delivery schemes would s=
pell the demise of Blockbuster, the company is now strong enough to muscle t=
he studios. That includes Paramount, which happens to be owned by Blockbuste=
r's former parent and still-80% owner, Viacom.=20
"They're dependent on the $20 billion-plus home-video rental market," Antioc=
o says in his Dallas office overlooking the new American Airlines Center. "I=
 don't feel sorry for them. It's a great revenue stream for them. Every stud=
io would be out of business without home video."=20
Studio executives won't soon forget Antioco's scrap with Universal in Februa=
ry. At the time, Blockbuster was involved in a video-on-demand trial with En=
ron, the energy company that has branched into telecom. Blockbuster would li=
ne up movies that Enron would distribute over its network. But the studios w=
ere reluctant to sign any licensing deals, preferring to keep their options =
open with other partners, especially cable companies.=20
At the least, Antioco thought he had a deal with Vivendi's Universal Studios=
 unit for video-on-demand rights as part of the renegotiation of its regular=
 videotape revenue-sharing agreement. But Universal balked at the eleventh h=
our, leading to a heated late-night phone call from Antioco to the head of U=
niversal Home Entertainment, Craig Kornblau.=20
Close the Enron deal or forget the revenue sharing, Antioco demanded. Just t=
o prove he wasn't kidding, Antioco refused to stock Universal's new Rocky an=
d Bullwinkle and Bring It On videos. Universal blinked. Antioco got his vide=
o-on-demand rights and then put Universal's movies on his shelves, a day lat=
e.=20
Though the deal with Enron eventually fell through, the message was clear: A=
s the single-largest revenue generator for the studios, providing 15% of the=
ir U.S. sales, Blockbuster isn't going to be pushed around. While Universal =
has complained of being bullied, Antioco makes no apologies: "I didn't want =
to be in a situation where we were shut out of a potential business opportun=
ity." Hedging his bets, Antioco also has a deal with GM's DirecTV unit to se=
ll the service in his stores, as well as cobrand pay-per-view channels for a=
 cut of sales.=20
Antioco learned his tactics as a convenience store retailer, rather than as =
someone smitten with Hollywood glitz. The son of a Brooklyn milkman, Antioco=
 got his start at Southland's 7-Eleven unit, where he spent his early days a=
uditing inventories of Slurpee cups and Slim Jims. Rising to the post of exe=
cutive vice president of operations and marketing, Antioco later served stin=
ts as head of Circle K and Taco Bell. Stocking some cineaste's precious vide=
o is no different to Antioco than stocking burritos or Twinkies.=20
"There is something very seductive about the movie business," says Antioco. =
"But the truth of the matter is, it's a business like any other business."=20
Now, thanks to the surprising popularity of DVDs, Hollywood has even more ca=
use for concern about Blockbuster. Sales of the discs are expected to double=
 this year to $7.8 billion, while rentals should more than double to $1.4 bi=
llion, according to Kagan World Media. Antioco figures that Blockbuster will=
 derive almost a third of its rental sales from DVDs by the end of the year,=
 up from nothing two years ago, and half of rentals by 2003. Blockbuster's e=
arnings (before goodwill amortization charges) are expected to jump 62% to $=
154 million for the year, on sales of $5.2 billion, according to SG Cowen, w=
hile the stock has almost tripled from its 52-week low to a recent $18.=20
But the studios face a Faustian bargain. The more Hollywood depends on DVD m=
oney, the less it can afford to cannibalize those sales by pursuing risky dr=
eams of video-on-demand. And that only strengthens Blockbuster's hand. Block=
buster never agreed to any revenue-sharing deals for DVDs as it did with vid=
eotapes, instead paying studios $15 up front per disc. While Blockbuster ren=
ts tapes and DVDs for about $3.65 each, its cost per rental transaction is $=
1.20 per DVD compared to $1.60 per videotape.=20
Some studio executives, most notably AOLTime Warner's Lieberfarb, aren't con=
vinced that Blockbuster is the only game in town. He predicts consumers will=
 buy more DVDs from mass merchants than they rent, and video-on-demand and s=
atellite TV will erode Blockbuster's near-40% market share for rentals.=20
So go ahead and find someone better to peddle your movies, says Antioco. "No=
 one is holding a gun to his or anyone else's head telling him to do deals w=
ith us. If they really believe that there is a way to monetize their product=
 without Blockbuster, I am sure they will do it."

INDIA: AES exit would not affect India's Orissa-official.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

CALCUTTA, India, Aug 21 (Reuters) - A threat by the Indian subsidiary of U.S=
=2E power firm AES Corp to pullout from Orissa would not affect how well the=
 eastern state's power sector performs, a provincial minister said on Tuesda=
y.=20
AES, whose investment in Orissa a few years ago was hailed as the beginning =
of serious reform in India's power sector, has a 51-percent stake in CESCO, =
an electricity distribution firm in the eastern Indian state. The Orissa gov=
ernment owns 49 percent.
Last month, AES said it would sell its stake in CESCO unless the state allow=
ed it to raise tariffs and gave it a better regulatory environment.=20
"It (the pullout) will have no impact at all," R.K. Patnaik, Orissa's financ=
e minister, told reporters in Calcutta on the sidelines of a business confer=
ence.=20
Patnaik said the role of AES, which has interests in 165 power plants worldw=
ide, had not lived up to expectations in Orissa.=20
"Transmission and distribution losses have come down only 1.8 percent from t=
he earlier 43 percent."=20
The U.S. company also holds a 49-percent stake in Orissa Power Generation Co=
rporation (OPGC), which sells electricity to state-run transmission firm GRI=
DCO.=20
AES complained that GRIDCO was not paying OPGC's charges, which had mounted =
to $45 million last month. GRIDCO says it cannot pay because CESCO owes GRID=
CO an even bigger amount.=20
"What is happening between CESCO and AES is their internal affair. The state=
 has absolutely no role to play in this. But we will step in if we receive a=
n SOS from CESCO," Patnaik said.=20
Foreign power utilities, which entered India in the early nineties, have fac=
ed rough weather due to a slowdown in the pace of economic reform.=20
Recently, Enron Corp announced its intention to exit the $2.9-billion Dabhol=
 plant in India.=20
Four other firms have already pulled out of India.=20
They include U.S. company Cogentrix, which walked out of a project to build =
a 1,000-MW plant in southern India last October, and Electricite de France, =
which scrapped plans to take a 15-percent stake in a project in western Indi=

India: 'Dishonouring energy contract is the main issue in India'

MUMBAI, Aug. 20 IT is important that monopoly industries like energy and pow=
er answer to regulating bodies if consumer interests are to be protected, ac=
cording to Ms Linda Breathitt, Commissioner, Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion (FERC), USA.=20
In an interview with Business Line, Ms Breathitt discusses the similarity be=
tween Maharashtra's Enron imbroglio and the energy crisis in California - bo=
th situations have proved a challenge to regulating bodies. Excerpts : What =
has been the reaction to two US majors pulling out of India? Ever since repo=
rts that US power majors AES and Enron wanted to walk out of energy projects=
 in India appeared in US trade papers, the industry outlook has been negativ=
e. It has been disturbing, especially being a regulator, to watch US compani=
es walking away from financial responsibilities here. American companies hav=
e so far found India an attractive place to do business in.
Do you see any parallel between the Dabhol incident and the situation you ha=
ve in California ? In India, the challenge with Dabhol company is not only o=
ne of the price of power, it has become one of how to keep foreign investmen=
ts in India. California is more about the undesirable effects of deregulatio=
n.=20
Power prices in San Diego shot up in May and the crisis caught up in the ent=
ire Western region of the country.=20
In India, it seems like dishonouring of the energy contract is one of the is=
sues. This is similar to California where the parties are hoping to renegoti=
ate certain contracts and consumers have filed a $9 billion claim with the F=
ERC. Regulators have to now balance between ensuring the sanctity of contrac=
ts and protecting the interests of consumers.=20
What can India do to ensure better regulation of the energy sector as a whol=
e ? There is a lot of convergence in hydro-electric power and natural gas tr=
ading. May be the Indian Government could ensure that there is knowledge-sha=
ring in agencies dealing with both these.=20
I am not telling the Indian Government what to do, as the markets in India m=
ay not be mature enough. But this may be a good idea at a future date, consi=
dering even the UK has recently combined its offices of gas and electricity.=
=20
What steps would a regulator need to take to ensure that interests of energy=
 consumers are safeguarded? The FERC has set up a cell to get real time info=
rmation on trade such as spot buying of electricity, weather problems which =
may affect power supply, etc. The thought behind this was to equip the regul=
ator with real-time up-to-date information on the current trade situation.=20
The main problems we have faced so far, have been the concerns of consumers =
such as municipalities and towns, about lack of transparency in energy tradi=
ng. These bodies do not have tools to keep them informed of the current ener=
gy situation and often end up buying gas from corporates at higher prices.=20
We have demanded that companies report daily prices, trades, requirements fo=
r transactions, etc. The corporates resent this. But as regulators, consumer=
 interests are larger than confidentiality clauses of the corporates.=20
Do you have any information exchange between the FERC and India's Central El=
ectricity Regulatory Commission ? The FERC and CERC plan to bring together t=
he State Commissions in India with their US counterparts to learn more about=
 each other's work.=20
Also, as part of the South Asian Regional Initiative/ Energy, there is an am=
bitious plan to synergise transmission, distribution, regulation, renewables=
 and environment in the entire South Asian region covering India, Nepal, Bhu=
tan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The programme will be funded by the US AED, d=
etails of which, are being chalked out.=20

VANCOUVER -- The Canadian government is watching closely as international en=
ergy and mining companies try to strike a delicate balance between protectin=
g themselves against threats such as kidnapping in foreign countries and res=
pecting human rights.=20
Canadian officials say they do not have a formal position on a voluntary cod=
e agreed to last year by the British and U.S. governments, seven multination=
al corporations and numerous non-governmental organizations.
But Canada is widely expected to join the process if it is opened to other c=
ountries.=20
"I would say the odds are excellent," said a spokesman for an American group=
 that helped develop the principles. "Canada is very interested."=20
The principles, announced last year, address the thorny issue of companies i=
n the so-called extractive sector -- either oil and gas or mining -- working=
 in countries where security risks, including kidnapping, are common.=20
Corporations' use of either their own employees or hired, local forces as se=
curity in countries such as Nigeria, Colombia and Indonesia can lead to huma=
n rights violations, including the use of excessive force or restricting leg=
al, public demonstrations.=20
Last year, some Canadian diamond companies were accused of using mercenary s=
ecurity forces in Africa. And companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell Group in N=
igeria and BP PLC in Colombia have also been criticized in the past by human=
 rights groups for alleged human rights violations by their security forces.=
=20
The voluntary principles on security and human rights outline steps that com=
panies can take to avoid such problems, including screening security service=
 providers for previous human rights abuses, and working with host governmen=
ts to attempt to ensure that international laws are respected.=20
The corporations who participated in drafting the principles included BP, Ro=
yal Dutch/Shell, Chevron, Texaco and Enron, as well as mining companies Rio =
Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan.=20
Canadian officials said the U.S. and British governments have kept Canada in=
formed of continuing discussions around the principles, and that Canada has =
shared the guidelines with interested companies.=20
"We have not yet developed a formal position on the principles," said Marie-=
Christine Lilkoff, a representative with the Department of Foreign Affairs a=
nd International Trade in Ottawa. "But we continue to consult with relevant =
stakeholders to gauge their interest in the principles, and continue to foll=
ow it very closely."=20
Talisman Energy Inc. is using the principles to help design its own policies=
, said Reg Manhas, Talisman's senior adviser on corporate responsibility. Th=
e Calgary-based oil company has been pilloried by church and human rights gr=
oups over its operations in war-torn Sudan.=20
"And we have put it on record with the U.S. State Department and with the go=
vernment of Canada that if the process is expanded to other countries and ot=
her companies, Talisman would like to be at the table," Mr. Manhas said.=20
Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. has also been studying the principles, and =
sent a consultant to an information briefing on the guidelines held last wee=
k in Washington, D.C.=20
"Canada has a very large number, relatively speaking, of corporations in the=
 extractive sector working all around the world," said Jim Cooney, Placer Do=
me's general manager of strategic issues. "And a number of those places are =
areas of conflict where security is an issue."=20
Mr. Cooney said the principles are signficant because of input from governme=
nt, industry and human rights watchdogs.=20
"I think this was the first time that government, NGOs and corporations toge=
ther have taken a joint initiative to deal with a common concern," he said.=20
He said Placer is studying the principles because human rights are part of t=
he company's sustainable development policy, and because the company operate=
s in places such as Papua New Guinea and South Africa where violence can be =
a problem. To date, he said, Placer Dome has not had to hire external securi=
ty forces, but he said the voluntary principles also apply to corporate pers=
onnel.=20
Observers who helped draft the principles said it is too early to judge how =
effective the principles have been, as companies are still in various stages=
 of implementing them.

Florida's Governor Outlines New Energy-Conservation Policy
Mark Hollis

08/21/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Orlando Sentinel - Florida
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World =
Reporter (TM)

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.--Sensing that energy issues could light up the 2002 govern=
or's race, Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday outlined a new energy-conservation policy=
 for state government and hinted that he would revive the fight to deregulat=
e Florida's electric industry.=20
With Florida's energy demands expected to greatly expand over the next 20 ye=
ars, Bush said new power stations will have to be built and there will need =
to be increases in the capacity of transmission lines. But he also said Flor=
idians can do more to cut energy use, and he wants state government to lead =
by example.
"We all agree that we need to build capacity, and we've begun to do that," B=
ush said. "But every megawatt we save in conservation is one less megawatt t=
hat has to be built."=20
After addressing a national conference of utility executives and regulators =
in Amelia Island, Bush said he would ask state officials today to begin cutt=
ing energy consumption. He said he wants a 5 percent per year reduction in t=
he amount of energy used by state agencies.=20
Among Bush's recommendations are: new requirements that agencies purchase fu=
el-efficient vehicles, the creation of a state energy office to develop ener=
gy policy and training for state workers on energy consumption. Bush said by=
 turning off at night the 77,000 computers in state government, Florida coul=
d realize up to $4.4 million a year in savings.=20
David Struhs, secretary of the state Department of Environmental Protection,=
 who accompanied Bush to the meeting, said one of the recommendations is to =
bring in energy experts to make state office buildings more efficient.=20
Struhs said the Bush plan would bring in private vendors who would spend the=
ir own resources making the buildings operate with less power and would be a=
ble to share in the long-term cost savings.=20
Bush has been an advocate for at least limited utility deregulation, which h=
as been promoted as a way to make it easier for out-of-state companies to bu=
ild plants and sell power in Florida. Among the firms interested in Florida =
is Enron Energy, which was a major campaign contributor to President Bush.=20
The move toward deregulation slowed in the Legislature after lawmakers becam=
e uneasy by headlines about California's woes.=20
"I think we should restructure," Bush said. "I think we need to move to a le=
ss regulated environment in the wholesale market. But we need to learn from =
the lessons of other states, most particularly California."=20
Also playing into Bush's call for more conservation measures is the fact tha=
t he has argued publicly against oil and natural gas drilling off Florida's =
shores. Just last week he said he wants his brother's administration to deny=
 drilling permits for a natural gas field, known as Destin Dome, that lies 2=
5 miles south of Pensacola.=20
"For a governor who opposes oil drilling near the state, it's important for =
you to come up with ways to save energy," said Brian Ballard, a Tallahassee =
lobbyist who represents power companies and has close ties to Bush. "Florida=
 isn't building a lot of power plants and doesn't want oil drilling. The onl=
y thing we can do affirmatively is to get our house in order."=20
Meanwhile, Bush acknowledged that energy issues of all sorts are likely topi=
cs in his re-election effort.=20
"One of the things we've tried to do is refocus folks in Tallahassee on long=
er-term issues," Bush said, mentioning road building, water capacity, growth=
-management reforms and energy policy.=20
Some say the debate over utility deregulation and Florida's energy demands a=
re stepping up.=20
"I think he's reading the tea leaves and realizes this is a very significant=
 issue," said Sen. Walter "Skip" Campbell, D-Tamarac, chairman of the Senate=
 Regulated Industries Committee. The Senate panel and Florida's Energy 2020 =
Commission are studying the feasibility of utility deregulation.

USA: Pacific N.W. states press FERC for power refunds.
By Chris Baltimore

08/20/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Northwest state officials pressed a F=
ederal Energy Regulatory Commission judge on Monday to consider refunding ov=
er $1 billion in overcharges they say they incurred to buy electricity durin=
g the California energy crisis earlier this year.=20
California officials also took part in the case to pursue $1.5 billion in re=
funds, part of the total $9 billion the state says it is owed.
Monday's pre-hearing before FERC Judge Carmen Cintron was the opening act in=
 a case brought by Puget Sound Energy Inc. and a host of Pacific Northwest c=
ities including Seattle.=20
It is one of two cases pending at FERC on alleged electricity overcharges.=20
The other, now before Judge Bruce Birchman, weighs the need for refunds on p=
ower sales within California state boundaries.=20
FERC commissioners ordered the hearings in July to sort out liability for th=
e meltdown of California's newly deregulated electricity market earlier this=
 year and its spreading impact in other Western states on power sold from la=
st Dec. 25 through this June 20. FERC could rule on the judge's recommendati=
ons in October.=20
"Our goal is to get as much money as possible back into the hands of the Cal=
ifornia ratepayers as quickly as possible," Kevin McKeun, outside counsel fo=
r the California Attorney General's office, told Reuters.=20
FERC JURISDICTION QUESTIONED=20
Energy firms named in the case said Monday FERC's July order does not give t=
he judge authority to rule on refunds. But state officials from areas affect=
ed by the California price spikes - including Washington, Nevada, Oregon, an=
d California itself, say refunds are within the scope of the hearing.=20
Cintron said her ruling may not determine the amount of any refunds, but may=
 spell out the a methodology for the FERC commissioners to use to set refund=
s. "I am not charged with making an initial decision in this case" on refund=
s, she said.=20
In documents filed at FERC on Friday, California said that energy companies =
overcharged by $1.5 billion to ship power from surrounding states and Canada=
 onto its grid.=20
Sales by Powerex, the power marketing arm of Canadian provincially owned uti=
lity BC Hydro, account for about $600 million of the refund amount. The rest=
 is for power bought and sold inside state boundaries.=20
ENERGY FIRMS: ALL SALES FINAL=20
Energy firms named as the culprits in the case - including Powerex, Enron Co=
rp. , Idacorp Inc. and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. unit Arizona Public Servi=
ce Co., say that the July FERC order does not empower the judge to rule on r=
efunds owed by their individual firms.=20
Judge Cintron should "defer individual claims and determine for (the Pacific=
 Northwest) to what extent refunds are due," said Lawrence Acker, an attorne=
y representing the 60 individual sellers that banded together into the so-ca=
lled "Transaction Finality Group."=20
They claim that sales they made to Pacific Northwest states are final and sh=
ould not be considered for refunds unless counterparties can show they wield=
ed unfair market power.=20
FERC should "leave contracts the way they are and not undo everyone's expect=
ations," said Dan Watkins, an Enron attorney.=20
Pacific Northwest and California officials cried foul at the demand. "The co=
mmission did specify directly that this proceeding should address potential =
refunds," said Philip Chabot, an attorney representing the so-called "net pu=
rchasers group" that includes Pacific Northwest utilities.
