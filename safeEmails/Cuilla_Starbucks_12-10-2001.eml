I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but y=
ou do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always cha=
rged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the =
coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that the=
y serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible a=
nd I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me ha=
ve all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Toda=
y, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the fi=
rst sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it =
was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that wa=
s supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells ho=
rrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn=
't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00=20
