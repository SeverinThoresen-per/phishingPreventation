You  have two cows.=20
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using  letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute =20
debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get  all
four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights  of
the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman  Island
company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the  rights
to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report  says
the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. =20
