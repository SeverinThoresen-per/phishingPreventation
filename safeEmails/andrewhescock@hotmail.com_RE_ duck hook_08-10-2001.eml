Keith i would love to meet you for a beer but i am in massachusetts at the m=
oment.  hopefully this head-hunter chick can set me up with some interviews =
in houston and we can meet up then.  As for your world tour, it really depen=
ds on how much you want to see.  You can take 3 months and rush through 20 c=
ountries and just see their main tourist sights, or you can take the same 3 =
months and see 4 countries really thouroughly and get a feel for a pleace's =
people, culture, way of life, economic system, food... all that jazz.  I can=
 definately recommend some amazing places to you though.  I've taken 14 mont=
hs and still haven't seen nearly everything i wanted to.  It's a big f-ing p=
lanet!
