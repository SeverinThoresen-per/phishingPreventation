Hi Tracy,  I've been thinking of you since Enron's in the news all the time =
now.  I bet it is stressful around there now.  How are you doing?  How was y=
our Thanksgiving?  We were in Houston last weekend after Thanksgiving & took=
 my parents to Galveston for the weekend.  Dylan got his first ear infection=
 so I wasn't able to see anyone but Stephanie.  Email me back.  Bye, Dana
