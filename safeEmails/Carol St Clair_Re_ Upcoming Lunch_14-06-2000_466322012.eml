Yes, and I've assumed that she is coming.  I also invited Jason and asked hi=
m=20
to get back to you.  Let's wait and see how large the group is and decide if=
=20
we need to relocate if that is possible.  Might there be any conference room=
s=20
that are larger if we need it (like on 44)?  If not, we will make do but wil=
l=20
need someone to bring us some extra chairs.
