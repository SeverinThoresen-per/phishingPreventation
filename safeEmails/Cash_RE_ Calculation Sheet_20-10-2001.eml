Cathy,

The voluntary separation calculator asks for a number for 2 weeks pay.  Shou=
ld that be four weeks, or does the program take the 2 weeks and multiply it =
to arrive at the four weeks base pay number?  If the latter, I can see it cr=
eating some confusion.  If the calculation sheet needs to be set up that way=
, perhaps we should drop a note explaining.
