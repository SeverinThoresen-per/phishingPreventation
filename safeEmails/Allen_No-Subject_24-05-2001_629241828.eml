John,

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achiev=
e this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minim=
izing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; an=
d (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the=
 crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our =
VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you tryi=
ng to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggress=
ively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also loca=
tions such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidi=
ty and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended mess=
ages. =20

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few mo=
nths regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR redu=
ction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are const=
antly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that p=
rovides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utiliz=
ation is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violatio=
n of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,00=
0.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should i=
ncrease with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the ru=
les need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept th=
ese policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this=
 morning.


Phillip
