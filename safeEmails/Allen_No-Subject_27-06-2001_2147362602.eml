Greg,

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  F=
irst, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, par=
t of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".  I would like=
 to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted l=
iving). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have men=
tioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next=
 two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirem=
ents for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner l=
ike Keith.

Here is the article:

Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Ho=
me and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future=
 land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos City =
Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land=
 Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mi=
le area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and app=
ropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a=
 controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ran=
ch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford=
 filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city c=
ommissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in s=
ynch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Propo=
sed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on=
 existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed=
 in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, on=
e additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres =
of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weath=
erford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to=
 town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the=
 revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on =
the property is proposed limited to "community commercial" -- a yet to be es=
tablished zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility=
 with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landsca=
ping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercia=
l areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envi=
sioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council mem=
bers over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highwa=
y.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford comme=
rcial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway=
 department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual =
curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance o=
f the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners a=
nd Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing =
the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a develope=
r's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  "I=
'd rather say "no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at =
it then," Hughson said.  Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety c=
oncerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  "It seems to me we're ask=
ing for a bunch of accidents to happen there," Mihalkanin said.  A motion by=
 Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property=
 failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council membe=
rs Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move. Council member Martha Ca=
stex Tatum was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two=
 Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives=
, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBrid=
e, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision =
process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan =
better served the interests of the city as a whole.  "This is not a victory =
for one side or the other," said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neig=
hborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "bu=
t a victory for the City of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've =
come a long way." =09
