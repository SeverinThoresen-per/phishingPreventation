When Tangie moved on to her new position she left Chris with $100.00 to have=
 a birthday party for the dept. This is money she had left over from our gro=
up.  After discussing with a few other associates it was mentioned this mone=
y should be contributed to our fellow Americans that were struck in last Tue=
sday's attack in D.C. and  N.Y.  I think that's a great idea, maybe we could=
 have a collection jar and add to the $100.00 and then have the company matc=
h before sending.  Is this okay with you Lynn & Shelley??

Thanks,
Ava
