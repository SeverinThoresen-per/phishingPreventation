SACRAMENTO, June 28 -- California legislators turned up the heat on power=20
generating companies today, citing two of them for not handing over document=
s=20
necessary in the state's continuing hearings on the spike in electricity=20
prices.=20
A special legislative panel, called the Senate Select Committee to=20
Investigate Market Manipulation, unanimously passed a contempt motion this=20
afternoon saying that the Mirant Corporation, based in Atlanta, and the Enro=
n=20
Corporation, based in Houston, had failed to respond to a June 11 subpoena=20
asking for documents.
The motion comes as the committee is trying to follow the paper trails to=20
determine if power generating companies willfully manipulated the supply of=20
electricity here last year in an effort to drive up prices. Several state=20
agencies are investigating similar charges.=20
Other companies, including Reliant Energy and Dynegy Inc., complied with the=
=20
committee's requests for thousands of documents related to power sales and=20
bidding procedures. Several other companies, which include the Williams=20
Companies, the Duke Energy Corporation, the AES Corporation and NRG Energy=20
Inc., are expected to hand over documents in two weeks.=20
California's two largest utilities have racked up $14 billion in debt,=20
forcing one to file for bankruptcy protection. Last week, three former=20
employees of Duke Energy told the committee that they observed behavior that=
=20
they believed was consistent with market manipulation. Duke denied the=20
charge, saying there was no merit to the accusations.=20
The chairman of the select committee, Joseph Dunn, a Democrat, said that if=20
Enron and Mirant complied with the request by July 10, the contempt order=20
would be expunged. ''We were not seeking to find contempt but to obtain=20
compliance,'' he said today. ''Unfortunately, we had to find contempt.''=20
The documents were subpoenaed earlier this month by the Senate Rules=20
Committee to obtain details on bidding, pricing and other aspects of power=20
sales. The power companies have said that they have not complied because the=
y=20
have not been able to negotiate an acceptable confidentiality agreement.=20
By seeking the contempt citations, the committee needs the full Senate to=20
follow through. There are no set penalties, said Laurence Drivon, the=20
committee's special counsel, adding that by law, ''the Senate can take such=20
action as it deems necessary and appropriate.''=20
Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, said the company was seeking=20
assurances that any information it handed over, which it considered=20
proprietary, not be made public. He said the company had been negotiating=20
with the committee up until today and hoped to resolve its concerns in the=20
next few days.=20
For Enron's part, a representative of that company sent a letter to Mr. Dunn=
=20
outlining its objections to turning over documents. Michael Kirby, a San=20
Diego lawyer, wrote that the documents the committee wanted were outside the=
=20
state and thus out of the jurisdiction of the California subpoena. He also=20
wrote that the committee was asking the company to reproduce documents that=20

SACRAMENTO -- Angered by the refusal of electricity wholesalers to surrender=
=20
information about suspected price gouging, a Senate committee voted Thursday=
=20
to hold two big energy companies in contempt of the Legislature.=20
It was uncertain what punishment, if any, may be in store for Enron Corp. of=
=20
Houston and Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. But committee members said potential=20
sanctions could include heavy fines and/or the jailing of corporate=20
executives.
"Jailing of an individual is an option and we intend to preserve all our=20
options," warned state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the committe=
e=20
investigating whether the wholesalers had manipulated the market.=20
"Could we impose, say, $9 billion in fines?" Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del=20
Rey) asked rhetorically.=20
Enron reacted angrily. "This is a shakedown," charged spokesman Mark Palmer.=
=20
"And if this is a shakedown, we're going to protect our legal rights."=20
Enron had further enraged the committee by sending a letter saying the=20
legislative panel had no authority to conduct its investigation because=20
wholesale prices were the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission.=20
A spokesman for Mirant said the company intends to keep talking to the=20
committee to reach an agreement.=20
The bipartisan committee had been prepared to find eight generators--mostly=20
out-of-state companies--in contempt for refusing to produce the subpoenaed=20
records. But by the end of the four-hour hearing, companies that said they=20
would cooperate--AES, Duke, Dynergy, NRG, Reliant and Williams--escaped a=20
citation, at least temporarily.=20
Though the committee found Enron and Mirant in contempt, its action is=20
subject to ratification by the full Senate.=20
Dunn said contempt citations are so rare there are few guidelines to follow=20
in determining a punishment. He said it "could be anything that the Senate=20
believes is necessary and reasonable."=20
The finding of contempt for failure to obey a legislative subpoena is rarely=
=20
used in California. Sources said it last was done in 1929 when an officer of=
=20
a cement company refused to cooperate in a price-fixing investigation.=20
Late in 2000 and earlier this year, the profits of major electricity=20
wholesalers soared astronomically, throwing the state's two biggest=20
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co.,=20
into financial chaos. Edison is teetering on bankruptcy and PG&E is in=20
Bankruptcy Court.=20
The committee, which first asked the companies to provide the information=20
voluntarily in April, encountered strong resistance from the energy=20
companies. They complained that their trade secrets might be exposed to=20
competitors, the public and government regulators.=20
Frustrated, the committee two weeks ago issued subpoenas demanding the=20
information, including whether the power sellers had destroyed any records.=20
The committee set Thursday as the deadline for compliance and threatened to=20
find violators in contempt, a tactic that appeared to turn around all but=20
Enron and Mirant.=20
"Let's move forward. We want to facilitate your investigation," said Duke=20
attorney Joel Kleinman of Washington, whose company had objected to its=20
subpoena.=20
At the last minute, several sellers began sending urgent fax letters or=20
witnesses to Dunn. Dunn said a quick scan of the letters showed wholesalers=20
were pleading for a second chance and assuring that the subpoenaed data woul=
d=20
be forthcoming.=20
Kleinman told the committee Duke did not want to be held in contempt.=20
"We will make tens of thousands of documents available for inspection,"=20
Kleinman said.=20
But he said Duke and the committee staff still must settle on a=20
confidentiality agreement, a matter he indicated was close to resolution.=20
Other wholesalers appeared to fall into line.=20
Dunn said he was concerned that "minor problems" in reaching a=20
confidentiality agreement might become a tactic for further delay.=20
The committee gave the six companies until July 10 to reach confidentiality=20
agreements and turn over a vast assortment of records.=20
The contempt finding against Mirant and Enron would be abandoned if they,=20
too, provided the confidential documents by July 10, when the committee will=
=20
review the companies' compliance.=20
The wholesalers also are the targets of similar investigations by Atty. Gen.=
=20
Bill Lockyer and the state Public Utilities Commission.=20

INDIA: Buyers seek price cut from Enron India unit-paper.

NEW DELHI, June 29 (Reuters) - Enron's troubled 2,144-MW Dabhol power plant,=

whose only buyer has stopped purchasing electricity, can find customers for=20
700 MW if it cuts its price, a business daily said on Friday.=20
The Hindu Business Line said the Central Electricity Authority submitted a=20
report to the power ministry saying the southern state of Karnataka was=20
willing to buy 300 MW from Dabhol Power Co in the western state of=20
Maharashtra.
It said Madhya Pradesh in central India could take 100 MW and Rajasthan in=20
northwestern India wanted 150 MW while the western state of Gujarat and=20
Haryana and Delhi in the north wanted 150 MW.=20
Karnataka said it was willing to pick up power at under three rupees while=20
others were willing to buy at around 2.8 rupees, the newspaper said.=20
At peak capacity, Dabhol, which is owned 65 percent by Houston-based Enron,=20
charged 4.75 rupees per kilowatt hour, more than the cost of electricity fro=
m=20
state-owned plants.=20
But after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board defaulted, Dabhol scaled=20
down to 25 percent capacity and charged 7.1 rupees, more than triple the rat=
e=20
of other suppliers.=20
Earlier this month, India's Junior Power Minister said Dabhol had offered to=
=20
charge much less for power from the second phase of its $2.9 billion project=
=2E=20
But a Dabhol spokesman said then it was too early to talk about specific=20
tariff cuts as they would depend on the plant load factor, the exchange rate=

and the prevailing oil price.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999. The second=20
phase would have added 1,444 MW this year but its contractors stopped work=20
this month as lenders were unwilling to support the venture.=20
The federal government recently asked the Central Electricity Authority to=20

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, June 28. THE Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has told the=20
Power Ministry that the neighbouring States will be willing to purchase only=
=20
700 MW of surplus power from the Dabhol project.=20
Some States have said that they are interested in peak power. Karnataka,=20
Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have suggested an average contrac=
t=20
period of two years.
Karnataka is the only State which has shown interest in picking up power=20
round the clock, throughout the year.=20
While it has pitched for 300 MW of DPC power, Madhya Pradesh has indicated=20
100 MW consumption, Rajasthan 150 MW and Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat pitching in=
=20
for the rest.=20
These States have said that they would have nothing to do with Dabhol Power=20
Company and that they would enter into a purchase contract only with=20
Maharashtra State Electricity Board.=20
Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have told CEA that they are not interested in=20
picking up the surplus power from the Dabhol project.=20
On the pricing front, while Karnataka has said that it was willing to pick u=
p=20
power at a price less than Rs 3 per unit, the others have suggested a=20
marginally lower price in the range of Rs 2.80 per unit.=20
The finding comes on the eve of the negotiating committee meeting on Friday.=
=20
One of the crucial issues facing the Dabhol project was the offtake of power=
=20
from the second phase having a capacity of 1,415 MW.=20
Power trade picks up: Even as the Enron controversy continues, power trade i=
n=20
the country has picked with the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) structuring=20
an innovative deal to purchase 150 MW power from West Bengal and sell it=20
across to the northern States.=20
This is unique since payment for power is to be made on a weekly basis as=20
against the convention of monthly billing. According to the PTC Chairman, Mr=
=20
T.N. Thakur, such an arrangement would disincentivise payment default. This=20
is because longer payment cycles make room for larger defaults and result in=
=20
negotiations relating to partial payment in order to restore power sale.=20
To ensure that this commercial argument works, PTC's contract with the selle=
r=20
includes a clause whereby it is not bogged down by any take-or-pay=20
arrangements. Hence, the purchasing States know that the threat to cut power=
=20
supply is a reality with no attendant financial encumbrances for PTC.=20
With regard to the seller, the lenders to the project in case of private=20
sector have raised objections as in the case of the Bhilwara group-promoted=20
Malana hydel project in Himachal Pradesh. In a deal similar to the West=20
Bengal contract, PTC is selling power from the project to Delhi.=20

Enron, Mirant Held in Contempt by Calif. Senate Panel (Update2)

Enron, Mirant Held in Contempt by Calif. Senate Panel (Update2)

     (Adds details of hearing, comments in ninth through 11th
paragraphs and in last two paragraphs.)

     Sacramento, California, June 28 (Bloomberg) -- A California
Senate committee voted to hold Enron Corp. and Mirant Corp. in
contempt after they refused to turn over documents sought in an
investigation of accusations that they manipulated power prices.
     The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation
in the Wholesale Energy Market, in the first contempt citation by
a California Senate committee since 1929, said the companies had
until July 10 to comply, or the full Senate would vote to impose
fines or other sanctions.
     The committee is investigating allegations that energy
generators withheld supplies or took other steps to boost prices
for electricity in California last year, when soaring wholesale
prices left the state's largest utilities insolvent.
     ``Our ultimate goal is the production of the documents,''
said committee Chairman Joseph Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana,
during a break in the hearing in Sacramento today. ``We've wanted
it for three months, and we want it today.''
     Enron's attorney said in a letter to the committee that the
company refused to comply because only federal regulators have
jurisdiction over the wholesale electricity market, and that a
state committee has no right to documents outside California.
Mirant said it needs assurances the documents would not be made
public before the company would turn them over.
     Six other generators agreed to honor the subpoenas after the
committee threatened to hold them in contempt if they didn't
comply. They are AES Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., NRG
Energy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc. and Williams Cos.
      California has spent more than $7 billion this year buying
power after its two biggest utilities became insolvent. State
utilities have more than $15 billion in losses and debt from
buying power at soaring prices over the last 12 months.

                         Enron Objects

     Enron laid out its objections to the subpoena in a letter to
the committee by its attorneys at Post Kirby Noonan & Sweat LLP
released by the committee today.
     Enron's lawyers argued that the committee does not have
authority to subpoena records from outside the state and said the
committee already had access to much of the information from state
regulators and the state's electricity grid manager.
     ``This is a shakedown. It's a witch-hunt. It's McCarthyism,''
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. ``We're going to protect our
legal rights and say something's wrong when it's wrong, and this
is wrong.''
     State Senator Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate's
utilities committee, said that if Enron and the other power
providers have done nothing illegal, they shouldn't be withholding
the documents requested.
     ``This does not look like to me like folks who have nothing
to hide,'' Bowen said during a break in the hearing. ``It's not
just a thumb in the eye, it's a pie in the face of the
Legislature.''
     The committee's action was the first time in 72 years that a
California Senate committee has held anyone in contempt, Dunn and
Bowen said. The 1929 action involved market manipulation in the
cement industry, Bowen said.
     Mirant wants the committee to provide guarantees that the
``millions of documents'' the company is collecting won't be made
public, spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.
     ``These documents contain proprietary information,'' Dorinson
said. ``We'll continue talking to the committee and see if we can
get a resolution to this issue.''

                        Private Depository

     During the hearing today on whether to hold the companies in
contempt, Joel Kleinman, a lawyer for Duke Energy, said the
company would create a private depository where the committee
could view the documents.
     Williams is also willing to turn over documents to the
depository, company lawyer John Larrea said. Williams has an
agreement to market and sell electricity produced by AES.
     Earlier today, Reliant Energy turned over 1,800 pages of
documents requested by the committee, Dunn said, and Dynegy
submitted 18,000 pages. He said the committee has not had time to
review the documents.
     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company is complying
with the committee's subpoena. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley
confirmed that the company had turned over some documents, and
would give the committee others if the company received assurances
they would be kept confidential.
     ``We need some guarantees of confidentiality,'' Wheatley
said.
     Duke and Williams agreed to a confidentiality agreement
offered by the committee that the companies had previously
rejected. That was the most significant accomplishment in today's
hearing, Dunn said.
     ``It took a hearing of this magnitude to force an agreement
on confidentiality,'' Dunn said after the hearing. ``They said
they want some minor tweaks. We'll see what those minor tweaks
mean.''



Duke Energy Agrees to Buy Mississippi Power Plant From Enron

Duke Energy Agrees to Buy Mississippi Power Plant From Enron

     Charlotte, North Carolina, June 28 (Bloomberg) -- Duke Energy
Corp., owner of the largest U.S. utility, agreed to buy a 400-
megawatt Mississippi power plant from Enron Corp. to expand its
generating capacity in the southeastern U.S.
     Duke spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce declined to disclose the
price of the purchase, which is expected to close in October.
     The natural-gas-fired plant, capable of powering 400,000
homes, is in Union County. Duke has a 520-megawatt plant in
Mississippi and is building two 640-megawatt plants there. One
megawatt is enough power to light about 1,000 U.S. homes.
     The North American Electric Reliability Council estimates
that the Southeast will need an additional 40,000 megawatts of
generating capacity in the next 10 years to meet demand,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke said.
     Duke shares fell $1 to $39.30. They had risen 40 percent in
the past year. Shares of Houston-based Enron, the largest energy
trader, rose $1.62 to $48.34.



U.S. Power Suppliers' Second-Quarter Profits to Rise (Update1)

U.S. Power Suppliers' Second-Quarter Profits to Rise (Update1)

     (Updates to adjust table with profit estimates.)

     Houston, June 28 (Bloomberg) -- Energy traders and power
generators such as Enron Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. will have
higher second-quarter profits because of rising electricity prices
in the West, and the opening of new power plants.
     Efforts to lower western power prices didn't bear fruit until
late in the quarter. California border prices averaged $236.89 a
megawatt hour, up from $73.51 in the year-earlier period, boosting
profit for anyone with power to sell.
     The future doesn't look as bright for traders. Federal
regulators last week ordered them to negotiate refunds that
California's Governor Gray Davis says should total at least $8.9
billion. Enron, El Paso Corp., Dynegy Inc. and Williams Cos. have
lost $24.7 billion, or 22 percent, in market value in the past six
months as a growing political backlash led investors to sell their
shares.
     ``The market really hates uncertainty, and when the governor
throws out a figure of $9 billion in possible refunds, that's a
lot of uncertainty,'' said John Nichol, a fund manager at
Federated Investment Management, which owns shares of generators.
      Soaring power prices have left California's two largest
utilities insolvent and saddled with about $15 billion in power-
buying losses and debts. Regulators have boosted rates by more
than 50 percent for businesses and consumers in the most-populous
state.

                         Prices Rise

     The soaring prices benefited companies such as Enron, which
sells both electricity and contracts that help limit customers'
risk when energy prices rise or fall. Enron will make 42 cents a
share, up from 34 cents a year earlier, based on the average
estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
     Dynegy, which owns natural-gas pipelines and California power
plants, made 40 cents a share in the quarter, based on First Call
estimates, up from 29 cents a year earlier. The Houston-based
company is 29 percent owned by Chevron Corp. of San Francisco.
     ``Companies with power plants in the West have done very
well,'' said Greg Phelps, manager of the $1.1 billion Patriot
Group of funds. ``The Pacific Northwest drought continues to crimp
hydroelectric supply, which is keeping prices higher.''
     In addition, companies opened new power plants across the
U.S. Duke, Mirant Corp. and Calpine Corp. opened new U.S. plants
with enough capacity to light almost 5 million homes in the last
year, boosting sales.

                         Regulators Act

      Strong earnings in the West are unlikely to last. Growing
voter disenchantment with President George W. Bush's handling of
the California crisis and a return of Democratic control of the
U.S. Senate led the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose
price caps for 11 states on June 18.
      The caps apply to all electricity on the western power grid,
the system of transmission lines that moves electricity through
the region. FERC also ordered generators to negotiate refunds with
officials from the states that could total as much as $15 billion.
Talks began on Monday.
     Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner, who is overseeing the
negotiations, told the Associated Press that ``in order to reach a
settlement, there will have to be refunds.'' Davis estimates the
generators overcharged California and its utilities by $8.9
billion or more.
     Enron, which earlier this year estimated it's owed $400
million to $500 million for California energy sales, is one of the
companies in the talks. Shares of the Houston-based company, the
largest energy trader, have fallen 44 percent this year and 20
percent this quarter.
     Enron's prospects also were hurt when it couldn't sell its
Oregon utility, Portland General, and its plans for trading space
on fiber-optic telecommunications networks grew less promising
because of the collapse of many Internet companies.
     Also, while natural-gas and electricity prices in the West
are up from a year ago, they are down from the first quarter.

                    Investigations Continue

     El Paso, owner of the biggest U.S. natural-gas pipeline
network and an energy trader, is being squeezed by falling energy
prices, increased regulatory scrutiny and the decline in the
prospects of its fiber-optic trading unit. The stock has fallen 28
percent this year.
     FERC is hearing arguments on whether the Houston-based
company conspired to boost natural-gas prices in California last
winter, and El Paso may have to pay refunds or fines. Gas fuels
many of the California's power plants, and higher prices
contributed to soaring electricity prices.
     The company will see second-quarter earnings of 77 cents, up
from 69 cents a year earlier, First Call estimates show.
     Williams's second-quarter earnings were almost unchanged at
55 cents, based on First Call estimates, because of wider profit
margins on refining and gas processing, and higher natural-gas
prices.
     Williams, the second-largest U.S. gas pipeline company, has a
20-year agreement with AES Corp. to supply fuel for plants in
Huntington Beach, Long Beach and Redondo Beach in California.
Williams, an energy trader, also sells the power from the plants.
AES, based in Arlington, Virginia, is one of the biggest U.S.
power-plant developers.

                         Boosting Capacity

     So far, Williams has agreed to refund $8 million to the
state, though it admitted no wrongdoing. It's also taking part in
the negotiations over bigger refunds.
     Mirant, an Atlanta-based power-plant developer, will see per-
share profit rise to 46 cents from 25 cents a year ago, according
to First Call. San Jose-based Calpine will earn 31 cents, up from
19 cents, and Charlotte-based Duke will make 52 cents, up from 44
cents, estimates show.
     Calpine opened plants in Arizona, Maine and Texas with a
combined capacity of 1,545 megawatts. A megawatt is enough power
to light about 1,000 U.S. homes. Calpine also bought two power
plants in Canada. Most of the company's plants are in California.
     ``Calpine is a classic story,'' said Chris Ellinghaus, an
energy analyst at Williams Capital Group. ``They'll get a double
boost from more production and higher prices.''

                          Building Plants

     Calpine runs or is building plants in 29 U.S. states and
Canada that provide enough power to light 29.9 million homes. It
plans to boost its capacity to 70,000 megawatts, or enough to
light 52.5 million homes, by 2005. The company's shares have
fallen 31 percent this quarter.
     Duke, a power-plant developer and owner of a natural-gas
pipeline network, opened five generating plants in the quarter
with a combined capacity of 2,840 megawatts.
     ``Part of our growth is related to (California), but part
comes from growth in our trading business, part comes from our
plants overseas and part comes from natural gas,'' Duke spokesman
Terry Francisco said. Duke shares have fallen 5.5 percent this
year.
     Mirant opened two plants with a combined capacity of 546
megawatts. Southern Co., the owner of Atlanta's utility, spun off
Mirant in April. Mirant's shares have climbed 54 percent since the
stock began trading in September.
     Generators had to rely on new power plants to boost revenue
during the quarter because electricity prices in New England, the
Middle Atlantic states and the Southeast were little changed from
a year earlier. Texas prices fell 19 percent.

                         Prices Level Off

     Prices also are stabilizing in California. Davis last week
released details on long-term contracts the state has signed to
secure about one-third of its power needs. The contracts have
reduced the state's dependence on the open market, driving down
power prices in the West.
     The contracts guarantee energy companies a steady stream of
revenue, though at lower prices than on the daily market. Still,
wholesale electricity prices will surge this summer in any part of
the U.S. where heat waves cause shortages, boosting generators'
profits, analysts say.
     ``There is still enough volatility in the market,'' Credit
Lyonnais Securities analyst Gordon Howald said. ``There are not a
lot of groups out there able to generate the solid earnings growth
you'll see in the power producers.''
