Subject:	Wednesday's Conference Call

Due to uncertainty and proposed changes to the ETS safety/env conference tha=
t is to be held next spring it has been decided to pospone the conference ca=
ll scheduled for Wednesday, until we are better informed as to the direction=
 we will be required to go (i.e. there is a good chance the conference may b=
e a shortened version held in Houston).  Until some of those decisions are m=
ade by upper management, it will be difficult to do a very good job of plann=
ing.  I will be glad to set up another conference call when conditions warre=
nt.
