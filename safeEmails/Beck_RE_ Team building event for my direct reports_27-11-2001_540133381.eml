Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much=
 communication from "above" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious t=
hings to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiv=
ing weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous conc=
ern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide =
data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know t=
hat company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the co=
mpany-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent b=
y hundreds of groups across the company. =20

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purp=
oses, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your direc=
ts that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their h=
ard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit=
 for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask=
 everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyon=
e would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - espec=
ially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we ha=
ve all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the ban=
k where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brough=
t something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally =

I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my=
 direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at =
the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an eve=
nt similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard =
and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to =
have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to e=
at at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Gl=
obal Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Ne=
ed to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about =
20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to co=
me too?

Let me know your thoughts

Beth
