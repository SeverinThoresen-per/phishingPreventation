I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.

The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) a=
ny more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
=20
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little=
 pests, and I want to do something about it.
=20
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris C=
ounty Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load =
of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
=20
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hour=
s are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
=20
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.

Best Regards,
