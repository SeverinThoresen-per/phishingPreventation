Karen,

You are right. I should have included some of my comments on the FOEX recent=
 trends. I''ll keep that in mind for next time.

Thanks,
Monika

Monika,

I think an important point to make is not just that the FOEX was up for the =
period, but that this is the third week of increases for the hardwoods index=
 after several mixed months (both increases and decreases).  However, it's a=
lso significant that this week's increase is less than that of last week ind=
icating that the market has not yet found direction.

In terms of the NBSK index, I think it'd be important to point out that this=
 is the first increase in the index since April of this year.  Again, I don'=
t believe this indicates any firm direction in the market, but it's nonethel=
ess a significant event. =20
