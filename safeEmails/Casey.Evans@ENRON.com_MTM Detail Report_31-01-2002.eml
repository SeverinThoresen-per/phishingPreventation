We will be needing a tool modified in Port Calc.  In the Report drop-down me=
nu, there is a report called "New Mark to Market Detail Report" which pulls =
the net asset and net liability value for each deal by counterparty.  Curren=
tly, the tool will query according to post id.  However, we will need to be =
able to extract this information by desk, also.  Can one of you help us out =
with this?!

Let me know if you have further questions!
Thanks!
Casey
