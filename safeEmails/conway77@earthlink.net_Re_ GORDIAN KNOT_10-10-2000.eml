Kevin,

Sound advice.  I do think I am in the regret stage, though.  I just can't
believe that she could be so clueless as to the state of the overall
relationship.  In the grand scheme of things, we got along extremely well.
I think I just need to break contact with her for a while.

I was laughing about the Campi issue.  After I read your email I vaguely
recalled through the memories of the alcohol induced haze that was your
wedding weekend hearing Pattie refer to Rich as Kampmann.  But, even if I
had remembered it while writing the email, I would have opted for a C vice a
K.  Thankfully, I never had to learn English as a second language.  I would
have sucked!

Though it was nice to dream of a Porsche 911, I, like a good engineer,
returned to my sensibilities to purchased a '99 Saturn SL2.  It is dark blue
with gray leather and only 7400 miles.  I really liked the customer service
aspect and figured I needed every support network I could at a time like
this.  The worst part is that both of my parents have Saturns so it seems
like an old person's car to me.

Speaking of support networks, my mom is in town for 11 days.  She is like a
built in maid service.  I didn't know the house could be this clean!

Take care,

Frank
