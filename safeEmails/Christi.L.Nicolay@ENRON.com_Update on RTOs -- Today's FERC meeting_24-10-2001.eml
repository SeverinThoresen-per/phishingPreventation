TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO propos=
als.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediati=
ons and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discus=
sion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questi=
ons on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatib=
le, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly pro=
viding "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community. =
 He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments rec=
eived at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. =
2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.
