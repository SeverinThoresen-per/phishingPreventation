Gerald-

I believe Ken is looking for a non-binding letter of intent.  He is trying t=
o=20
put a deal together for Lone Mountain.  He also mentioned needing a "typical=
"=20
gas purchase contract to give them also.  Do we have a form for a non-bindin=
g=20
gas purchase agreement?  I'm tied up this morning till after 10:00 AM.  I=20
will touch base with you after that.

Thanks,

Audrey
