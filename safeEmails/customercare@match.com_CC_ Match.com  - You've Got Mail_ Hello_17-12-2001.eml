Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might =
have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting.  I thought about you=
 this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow =
on Saturday night.  I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow.  There isn't anything going on around here and =
probably won't be for awhile.  Our boss was here Friday night for our Christ=
mas party.  He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new =
deal.  So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening.  I'm looking forward to the conversation=
=2E  Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.)  Solutions for solving world hunger
2.)  Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on =
this one)
3.)  NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.)  Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child
