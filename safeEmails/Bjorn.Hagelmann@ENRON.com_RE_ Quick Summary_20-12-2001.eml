Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back.  Most of the time traders are=
 focused on setting curves.  Mid office has the most work, booking cancellat=
ions out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears=
 as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.  C=
reditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favo=
r a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that=
 going to settlement might be preferred.   Legal is deciding difference betw=
een "executable" contracts (able to negate deal) and "forward" contracts (co=
llapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other=
 being beneficial for wholesale.   South America appears to have similar iss=
ues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transactio=
n, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.

In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, =
given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking.  However, below is t=
he VAR COB 12/18/01.
