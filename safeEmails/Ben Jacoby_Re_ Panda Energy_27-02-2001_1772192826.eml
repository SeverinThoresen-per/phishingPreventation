I don't believe Chris wants to sell the LV transformers, but I'll confirm.

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the=20
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to=20
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  The=
y=20
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of=20
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is=20
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not=20
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the=20
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay=20
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is=20
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable=20
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase=20
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (simila=
r=20
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing=20
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit=20
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for=
=20
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are=20
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use a=
t=20
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will=
=20
let you know when I hear back from him.

Fred

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen=20
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout=20
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Doe=
s=20
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates,=20
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell th=
e=20
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. =20
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We=20
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact,=20
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the=20
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm=
=20
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I=20
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want=20
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk t=
o=20
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Kay
