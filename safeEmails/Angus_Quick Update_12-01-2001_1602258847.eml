John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.  At the=
 time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start  and ha=
ve joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.
At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some project=
s (domestic and international) that we're working on.  One of our business g=
roups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are=
 some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.  I =
thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest i=
n taking a look at it.  Let me know when you have a free moment.
