Thanks for your input.  I will definitely take this into consideration.

Also, I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done fo=
r=20
me.  I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry=
;=20
and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.  It ha=
s=20
been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and=20
argue with!).  Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.  I really=20
appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a=20
different view.  (I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you=
=20
help me to do that.)  You don't try to slip anything by, and you take=20
responsibility for your work/actions.  That's hard to find these days.  I=20
just wanted to let you know that.  Thanks.

But, I will still continue to think of you as in that Dilbert cartoon: =20
"Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling.  That's an indication that=20
you have poor interpersonal skills."=20
