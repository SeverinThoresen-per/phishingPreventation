Subject: Reliant Energy - Entex Transport Imbalance


Howard,
This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April=20
of 1999 on=20
transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was=20
shorted to keep
Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport=20
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of=20
1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC=20
Index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can=20
clear this imbalance. We will
need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the=20
purchase from ENA by 91,297=20
MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant=
=20
Energy - Entex allocation to=20
make sure this happens.


Thanks,
Michael
