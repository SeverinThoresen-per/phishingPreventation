On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have=
 been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base d=
eals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term de=
al we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with =
it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previ=
ously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Ent=
ex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be s=
erved off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this =
deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selli=
ng to Equistar
off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport =
agreement with
HPL or Channel.

On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that i=
s going
to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that fo=
r convenience,
can HPL sever the point some other way?

Someone let me hear what you think.

thanks

bob

I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:

1. Channel -  012-15600-02-069	ENA using HPL's capacity - selling to Equista=
r on Channel

2. Oasis and PGEV - HPL is using ENA's capacity

3.  Tejas Ship and Tejas Gas - Daren says we don't do business often on thes=
e pipes as ENA, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time,=
 so ENA would need it's own transport contracts

Let me know if anyone has questions.  Thanks!
