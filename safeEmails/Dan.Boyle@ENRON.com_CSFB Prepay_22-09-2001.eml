Barry:

We have calls into both Anne and Treasa to discuss the pending rollover and =
need for a $200 million increase of the existing CSFB prepay.  As soon as I =
hear from them, I will let you know.

CSFB and our internal counsel independently agree that the mechanism is in p=
lace to quickly and efficiently handle the increase, but as yet CSFB does no=
t have credit approval.  While Osmar and James committed to give me an updat=
e on the credit approval process over the weekend, they were clear that the =
final answer likely will not come until Monday.

As a fallback, can Joe's deal with Chase be increased under the terms and co=
nditions we discussed Friday evening?  Is DB (Paul Cambridge) an alternative=
?  Aside from CSFB, Chase, Citi and DB, I don't know if any of the other tie=
r one institutions have the ability or capability to respond in the time ava=
ilable.  Possibly Barclays but I understand that their commodity derivative =
group is just getting started.

If you have any thoughts let me know.  I will give you an update when I spea=
k to London or CSFB.
