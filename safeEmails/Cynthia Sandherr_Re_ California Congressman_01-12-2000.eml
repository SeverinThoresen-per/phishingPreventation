Sandy:  yes; it is a loss as both Rogan and Bilbray would have voted with us=
=20
on restructuring.    Lewis would not give up Appropriations where he is a=20
Cardinal.   Herger would not give up Ways & Means.  Rohrabacher would have t=
o=20
give up International Relations which might be a possibility we could check=20
out.  But, do you believe Rohrabacher would be free-market on electricity=20
issues????  He is awful on free trade issues and supports sanctions.  The=20
National Foreign Trade Council gave him an "F" score. =20

But, hence, herein lies the problem.  Some of the best in the delegation are=
=20
already on top-tier Committees and will not move while those willing to move=
=20
might not be good on our issues.  Other ideas?????  Thanks.
