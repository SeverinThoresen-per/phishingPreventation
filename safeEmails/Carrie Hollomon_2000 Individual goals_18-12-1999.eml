Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed i=
n=20
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own=20
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will=
=20
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we=20
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so tha=
t=20
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even=
=20
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie
