Thanks for your nice note.  Did you get the job?  I certainly hope so. =20

I appreciate your thoughts and prayers - both are very much needed!  We are =
all still somewhat in a state of shock over the state of the company.  I fin=
d myself working lots of hours on things that several months ago we wouldn't=
 have thought about.  Life is always interesting - it may take a while to se=
e where this twist is leading us, but I do know that it will be interesting!=
