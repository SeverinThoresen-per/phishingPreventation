Howdy,

Seems like our companies have been getting more than their fair share of
business magazine covers lately -- BW had Enron last week and HP this week
-- it is interesting for me to feel so closely tied to some of the biggest
stories in the business community right now -- I'm thinking that you would
choose a word other than interesting!

This has been a fun holiday season for us -- I took Rebecca to the Festival
of Trees -- a fancy tree decorating fund raiser and The Nutcracker Ballet --
it was very nice for Boise.  Tomorrow is her school program and tomorrow
night I am taking her to the Botanical Gardens, which are decorated in
lights this time of year.  But her main goal is getting to Christmas day and
opening presents -- she drives me nuts asking to open presents 55 times a
day :-)  On the 26th we are heading to San Diego for 4 days in the sun -- hp
is pretty much shut down from Dec 24 - Jan 1 opening Jan 2nd.

Are your winter plans taking you to Salt Lake for the Olympics?  Paul and I
will be there Feb 12 -15 -- I have tickets to the men's short and long
figure skating event.  As you can imagine,  I am VERY excited.  Not too much
else planned for the winter -- if you and your family want to sneak away for
a winter ski trip, think about Sun Valley.  I'd love to set something up for
us all.....except Katherine....she just starting walking...not quite ready
for skis!

Take Care,
Stephanie
