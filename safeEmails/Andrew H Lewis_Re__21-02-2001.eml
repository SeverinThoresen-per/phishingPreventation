Does this mean that you will consider providing this access in the near=20
future?  I imagine their are quite a few employees who live in an apartment=20
(almost all recent college graduates).  Considering the intentions of the=20
program were to bring high technology into every employee's household,=20
neglecting those that live in an apartment would make the program a failure=20
in my opinion.

I would appreciate a more detailed response.

Thank you,

Andy

To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself=20
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high=20
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel=
,=20
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

Andy
