Hi. Hope your week is going well.  I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma =
or bronchitis or the like).
Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.  Then there is adopt=
ion stuff and then there is world news.  I am really hoping that you will ha=
ve some time to be my therapist this weekend.  What would you think about tr=
yin to coordinate hair appointments Sat?  My only constraint is Chad's noon =
soccer game.  If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?
