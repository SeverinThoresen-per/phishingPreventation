TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas (deal 632998) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF (deal=20
657407).  TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost (dea=
l=20
657409) at St 45.  It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate=20
for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel.  SO, I just changed the price on=20
deal 657409 from Z2 IF + .09 to Z2 IF + .045.  We should see about $68,000.0=
0=20
move from TP2 to Gulf 1.
