The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. =
I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading=
 house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospec=
tive and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I ha=
ve been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basket=
ball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take thems=
elves too seriously.=20
