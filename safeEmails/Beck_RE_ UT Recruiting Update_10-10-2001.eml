Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three schol=
arship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, =
as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the =
dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/s=
taff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a r=
esponse from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attende=
es. =20

I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it h=
as worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind=
 the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan'=
s late in the spring. =20

Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who =
interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the f=
irst year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interview=
er, but is obviously not included. =20

Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glis=
san, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University A=
ffairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remot=
ely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last=
 year planned the dinner). =20

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us =
with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone c=
alls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinn=
er with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of "mo=
re senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth=
 Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked w=
ith Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back =
from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey. =20

Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bol=
d above?  --Sally    =20

I think that Mike might be available.  Also, maybe Mark could do both days. =
 Lastly, has anyone checked with Wes Colwell?  Sally, are we doing the schol=
arship dinner Tuesday night?  If so, should we involve some of these people?

Rick:

I have put together a brief campus update, including all previous and future=
 events for the fall recruiting season.  Changes to our original campus plan=
 are noted on the attachment.  As you can see, I still need 3 interviewers f=
or October 16th.

All of our events have been well-received on campus.  The presentations that=
 we have given to various student organizations have been of great benefit t=
o our recruiting effort.

Regarding our campus numbers, I intend for the following:
Full Time:
Round 1: interview 55 candidates
Round 2: interview 36 candidates
Super Saturday: invite 15 candidates
Target: hire 10 candidates

Interns:
Round 1: interview 14 candidates
Round 2: interview 8 candidates
Target: hire 5-6 interns

	Please let me know if you need anything else or if I can provide any additi=
onal information.

	Thank you!
