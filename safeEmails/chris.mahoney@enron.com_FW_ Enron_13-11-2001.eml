't make the meeting today but will call you later to discuss this.     =20

Jen,

I start 26 November in London on Chris's advice, as I haven't been able to
reach you.  I know that we said it might be best if my first month with
Enron were worked in Houston, but it now seems wisest to put that off for a
while. =20

best regards,
Deborah
