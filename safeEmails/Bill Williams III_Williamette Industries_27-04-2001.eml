Steve,
When entering deals for Willamette, the buy price in Enpower needs to be the=
=20
sell price minus transmission. This basically allows Willamette to be flat=20
against our book.  We then receive an annuity from Willamette at the end of=20
the month.  If you have questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
