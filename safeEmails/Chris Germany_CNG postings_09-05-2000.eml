I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI =20

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you=20
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our=20
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into=
=20
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited=20
number=20
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity=20
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:=20
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering=
=20
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications fo=
r
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig,=20
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles"=20
affected=20
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217,=20
3218,=20
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and=20
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, ther=
e=20
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor=20
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression=20
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the=20
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the=20
applications=20
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably=20
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering=20
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the=20
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the=20
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominio=
n=20
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time=20
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the=20
application=20
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, onc=
e=20
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable withi=
n=20
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capaci=
ty
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights f=
or
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will=
=20
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the propos=
ed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include=20
the=20
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression=20
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,=20
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be=20
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:  =20

    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a=20
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.=20
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of=20
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at=20
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may=20
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering=
=2E

Sincerely,=20
