Hey Doug,

Here is what would be great to have:

for Pulp
All the mills, their most updated capacity (can you also find out how often =
they update the capacity and whether they remove the maintenance related dow=
ntime when they come up with the capacity number)
and the type of pulp they produce.

for Printing & Writing paper
same thing for paper too.In addition, what kind of pulp they use to produce =
the paper.

Can we get the same info in a spreadsheet from too?

thanks,
Monika
