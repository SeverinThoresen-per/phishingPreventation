Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political=20
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".=
 =20
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine i=
f=20
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it=20
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an=20
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward=20
