Toby,

Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'=
m going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage p=
osting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try=
 to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can'=
t just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't ea=
ch outage posting be its own document?
