Hello Mr. Uutella,

Thanks for sending me the report. I have read it and I am in the process of =
preparing a summary of it. I  have a couple of questions for you though.

First, can you explain a little bit about the TAD technology, like how it is=
 done and so on. Also what does TAD stand for?

Second, what does AfH stand for?

Third, the consumption numbers for all the continents were given for year 19=
99. Do you have them for 2000 yet?

thanks for your help,
best regards

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue=20
Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus=20
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach=
 the=20
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with=20
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned p=
lus=20
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$=
=20
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I=20
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards
