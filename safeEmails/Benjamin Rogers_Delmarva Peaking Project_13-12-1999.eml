Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a=20
WinZip file.  You may want to check it against the previous model they sent=20
to us to see what has changed.  I will be putting together questions on the=20
model they sent over.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and go=20
through them.  Bruce - you may want to go through it to check the O&M=20
assumptions.  Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin=20
Norris a call. Thanks
Ben
