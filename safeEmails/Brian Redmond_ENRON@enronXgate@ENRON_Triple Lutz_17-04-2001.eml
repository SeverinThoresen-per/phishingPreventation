Team:

We are fast approaching our June 1 date to Close the HPL transaction.  A cri=
tical path items is to complete the unwind of the monetizations of HPL asset=
s.  There are a number of converging activities that will require legal reso=
urces, so it is important that we clear out as many activities as possible s=
o we don't reach legal gridlock at the end of May.

Tim Despain, can you lend your support to Ranabir/Shirley to move Hancock an=
d Prudential to act?  Let me know if further resources/attention is needed. =
 Right now Hancock/Pru are the bottlenecks.=20

Anne, I will call HCC and see where we are on unwinding the Project Rock met=
er monetization based on the documents you sent them.

Ranabir, can you prepare a schedule showing when we will have each monetizat=
ion unwound and what the critical items/actions are for each.

Let me know if you need additional resources.  Lets get this done!

Thanks,
Brian
