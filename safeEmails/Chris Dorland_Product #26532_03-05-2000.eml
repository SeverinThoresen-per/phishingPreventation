Dale,

The short description for the above product should read CAN Gas Swap Nit=20
Daily as opposed to Can Gas Swap Nit Monthly.=20

I don't know why the description changed from when I set it up. Would it be=20
easier for me to set up another product and kill this one?

Let me know.

Thanx,

Chris
