NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday =
with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agre=
ement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said.=20


Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns =
the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.


The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest sh=
areholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with addit=
ional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operat=
ions.=20


The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit shoul=
d the two companies fail to complete their merger. The deal, which still nee=
ds shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next=
 six to nine months.=20


Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion=
 based on the recent price of Dynegy shares.=20


The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosure=
s about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corp=
orate officers. The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and E=
xchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder law=
suits.=20


During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small frac=
tion of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company =
evaporated. As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings thre=
atening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to rais=
e additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in it=
s business.=20


Industry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies soug=
ht to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its m=
ost valuable business.=20


In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading b=
usiness has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent event=
s.=20


According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy =
has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stoc=
k of the Enron pipeline unit.=20


Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares i=
f it desires, the spokeswoman said.=20


For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to acce=
pt a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its pref=
erred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an inc=
rease in Enron's stock price, Rosser said.=20


In either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional considerat=
ion.=20


Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Franci=
sco, made an investment in Dynegy.=20


If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about on=
e-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the=
 combined company. ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additiona=
l $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close =
of the acquisition.=20


Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the=
 cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparti=
es.=20


Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies. Moody's Inves=
tors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above spe=
culative grade.=20
