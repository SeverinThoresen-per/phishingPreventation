I'm just a "Pea-On", but it's a shame to let Dynegy have the company for $8 =
billion dollars.  Enron is often known and admired for their creative and br=
ight minds.  Why can't the people buy the company, we are going less than a =
football team.  I know certainly we are a lot smarter.  It's awful that we'r=
e getting calls from the enemy telling us to "Get out of their new building"=
=2E  You help build this company, you have idea's don't just throw it away o=
n one month of bad press.  If you give up, they will say it's always better =
the old way.   WE ARE ENRON, WE HAVE CLASS, AND WE DONT LAY DOWN AND DIE.  W=
E HAVE A SOLUTION.!!!! =20
