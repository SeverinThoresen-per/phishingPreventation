The deal is for all four units at $16.45 million each. I will talk to Lee=20
Johnson this morning. Part of the deal will involve us purchasing 4=20
additional units from GE for a late '01 delivery.

I'll call you after I talk to Lee.

Regards,

Ben

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen=20
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout=20
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Doe=
s=20
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates,=20
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell th=
e=20
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. =20
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We=20
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact,=20
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the=20
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm=
=20
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I=20
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want=20
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk t=
o=20
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Kay
