I think we are planning to hire all the mill workers listed on the schedule =
attached to the agreement.  We will be agreeing to some of the requests in t=
heir agreement, but not most of the substantive ones, such as their request =
that we trade out value for unvested GP stock options for Enron stock option=
s, their demand that we maintain bonus programs that are similar, etc.  Geor=
ge's view is that we will control how we handle the employees, not GP.

 'em?

Don't worry about the "substantially similar" benefits issue--- I will deal =
with it.  Offering a job to all or substantially all employees is bigger iss=
ue.  Recognizing your need for flexiblity, we need to find a solution to tha=
t issue.
