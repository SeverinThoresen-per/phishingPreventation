Hey Eva,

Sorry for the delay, but it has been absolutely nuts lately.  I think the=20
smallest move we have had in the last 2 weeks was 30 cents.  Not to mention =
8=20
of the days were close to or more than $1.00.  Luckily, most of us have been=
=20
on the right side through all this.  And lest I forget about basis.  Demarc,=
=20
Vent, Chicago all up 70 cents.  And PEPL basis trading as high as plus 25=20
cents.

Anyway, I am taking a much deserved vacation.  I will be flying to Boston=20
tomorrow and coming back on Christmas.  I am looking forward to just hanging=
=20
out with the family and spending time with my nephew.  Let me know if you ar=
e=20
going to be in Boston during this time. My cell phone number is 713-306-0760=
=2E

On a completely different note, we finally got your postcard from Peru. =20
Sorry to hear about the backpack fiasco, but it sounds like you had an=20
incredible. time.

Looks like its about time to get outta here.  Lots of laundry and packing to=
=20
do.
