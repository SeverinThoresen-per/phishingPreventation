Joe -

I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's=20
supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the=20
accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke=20
with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal. =20
Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discus=
s=20
the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation =
-=20
Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to=
=20
move his family to Tokyo.

The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss=20
that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible=20
but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that=20
Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start=
=20
towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there=
,=20
which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we=20
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with=20
Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'=
d=20
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so=20
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will=20
be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to=20
accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support thos=
e=20
efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in=20
Sydney.

Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the=20
temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she coul=
d=20
address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London=20
(Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office=20
their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier=20
than Barry.

Cassandra.
