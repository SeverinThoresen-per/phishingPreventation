Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to =
the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found =
the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threa=
ts seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center st=
ill further. =20

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-62=
00.
