Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.=
  I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office,=
 its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which =
should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the fie=
ld offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consi=
stent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you=
 could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.

Good job on handling the "5's".

Regards
Delainey

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the fo=
llowing conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They d=
on't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought i=
s that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactl=
y the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburge=
r" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we=
 proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick
