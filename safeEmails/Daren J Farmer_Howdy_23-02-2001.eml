Hey Ken.

How are things going for you?  Is the market loving you?

We have been really busy.  We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.  I=
=20
don't think I had it underpriced.  I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales=
=20
in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the=20
average.  Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were=20
happy.  Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in=20
Oaks of Devonshire.  It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.=
 =20
It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a=20
great game room/sunroom for the kids.  It was built in 86, so it needs a=20
little work.  But that's ok with me.  Anyway, we are closing on both houses=20
on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.  We will have you and Linda over=
=20
for lunch or dinner one of these days.  We also had tubes put into Jake's=20
ears this month.  We hated having to do that, but it has really made a=20
difference.  He had a constant ear infection since October.  Now you can tel=
l=20
that he feels so much better.  He's learning more and more each day.  We hav=
e=20
nothing that is "Jake proof".  Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets=20
don't hold him.  He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over=
=20
that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.  I'm going to instal=
l=20
pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.  We'll see if that stops him. =20
Anyway, everybody's doing well.  I will be alot better after we finish this=20
house business.  I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks. =20
Talk to you later.
