Norma:
My husband and I have the following HR questions that I hope you can help us=
=20
with.  As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity=20
leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.  My plan is to return to work on=20
January 8th.  Here are my questions:

1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.  From a=20
benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39=20
hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?  In others words, are there any=20
benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?

The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated=20
below:

 Medical Coverage Semi Monthly=20
    Flexdollars
RRH Employee Only  123.22
 Employee/Spouse 146.97
 Employee/Child 137.00
 Employee/family 165.25

RPT Employee Only  82.15
 Employee/Spouse 97.98
 Employee/Child 91.34
 Employee/family 110.17


2. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still=20
eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute a=
t=20
year-end? =20
 That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option=20
program.  However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your=20
situation to be apart of the program.
Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me=20
eligible?   No.
Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke=20
are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January,=20
2001.

3. Our bank account has been recently changed.  I pulled down the "Direct=20
Deposit Authorization" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to=20
fill it out and send it back to you.  Is that correct?  Yes, please send to=20
EB3698
What is your office location?

4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to b=
e=20
submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid=
?
 No.  Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.

I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.  My home phone=
=20
number is 281-890-7122.
