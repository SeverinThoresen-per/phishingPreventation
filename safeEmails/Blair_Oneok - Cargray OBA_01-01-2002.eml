	Delaine Kurth with Oneok called today and wanted an OBA at the (Skellytown)=
 Cargray
	Plant (POI 8442) effective 1/1/2002. =20

	After talking with Vernon, I told her that we would draft an OBA on Wednesd=
ay with Month
	to Month cash out language in it.  She said to send her the contract and sh=
e will run the
	traps.  She was not excited about the monthly cash out requirement. I told =
her if we could
	come to agreement we would make it effective 1/1/2002.  If we could not com=
e to agreement,
	we would continue the same methodology as we have today, which is Oneok pic=
ks one of the
	transportation contracts at the Cargray tailgate to take any variances.

	Karen, per our conversation, please draft an OBA to send to Oneok. =20

	If anyone has any other thoughts or comments on preparing this OBA, please =
let Karen or
	I know. =20

	Thanks. Lynn
