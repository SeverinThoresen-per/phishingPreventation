Greetings,
These are the latest events related to the Jose LNG project:
A working group from the Ministry of Energy is furiously working to finish=20
the Gas Availability Report to be presented to the Ministry of Energy by the=
=20
end of this month. The balance of gas is the variable that, according to the=
=20
Ministry, will determine the fate of gas export projects. PDVSA-Gas is very=20
optimistic that the gas will be there (they are participating in the working=
=20
group, and pushing for a positive outcome).
The E&P Gas Round bid is proceeding according to schedule. Bids are expected=
=20
by the end of June and there seems to be significant interests from=20
participants. The Gas Availability Report would be made public after the bid=
=20
date, sometime in July (we would know before then, however).=20
Although a successful round will definitively help the project, the threshol=
d=20
for success seems to be relatively low. If only two or three of the nine=20
fields are allocated, the round will still be considered successful. Even if=
=20
the fields are not allocated in this round, PDVSA-Gas would develop some of=20
them, and the LNG project would still be approved.
Regards,
ALF
