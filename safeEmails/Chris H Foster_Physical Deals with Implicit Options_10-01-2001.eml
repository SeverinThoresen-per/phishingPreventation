Hey Guys

I'm considering some fixed or indexed gas and energy purchase transactions
with built-in price caps and/or floors as a hedge.
Given our sparse resources, I know I won't be able to ISDA agreements or get
a NYMEX account opened anytime soon.

Here are a couple of concepts that I'd like to float in hopes that your
organizations may feel comfortable executing under WSPP or existing gas
supply agreements:
1) Fixed price purchase that converts to monthly index below a specific
strike (implicit put);
2) Collared index (put/call) or capped index (call).

I'm thinking of border gas and SP15 energy products with fixed volumes,
prices (as applicable) and strikes by quarter.

Any comments?
