Hello Everyone,=20

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, th=
e overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the coll=
ege games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who=
 got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both mis=
sed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St.=
 game.=20
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone=
, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay gam=
e was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also mis=
sed by about half the people.=20

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games mis=
sed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 ga=
mes missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight=
=2E There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose=
 Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will wi=
n outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total point=
s. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore =
Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he w=
ill tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points a=
re from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Te=
nnessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split w=
ith Rob.=20

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that fo=
r the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We ha=
d 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no=
 Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks =
will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with th=
e amount of games they missed.=20
