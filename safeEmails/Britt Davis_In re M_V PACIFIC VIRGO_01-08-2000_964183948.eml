PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

David,

 This will summarize our telephone conference of today's date.  I understand=
=20
that you had an extensive and interesting conference with Matt and Neale=20
Gregson of Watson, Farley's Singapore office.  While you are still wading=20
through a great deal of new information, I understand your preliminary views=
=20
to be as follows (subject to your further review):
=20
 1.  You feel comfortable with using Captain Richard Gregory of Noble,=20
Denton's Singapore office as one of ECT's experts, so long as he does the=20
work himself.  You are going to do some additional investigation  with Neale=
=20
of  Dr. Eric Mullen of Burgoyne's, who would be acting as ECT's chemist,=20
given that his background may primarily be in fire investigation.  If you=20
decide to use someone other than Dr. Mullen, please give me your=20
recommendation as soon as possible, so that we can make sure that our "first=
=20
team" of experts is available to attend the joint survey/analysis.  Please=20
also let me know as soon as you hear for when it will be scheduled.

 2.  You felt that our case against Mitsubishi would be very dependent on th=
e=20
exchanges between ECT and Mitsubishi regarding tank cleaning, along with=20
interpretation of various charter party clauses.  While Matt will correct me=
=20
if I am wrong, I believe that Eric Tan was ECT's "point man" on those=20
negotiations.  Perhaps Matt could liaise with you to set up a joint telephon=
e=20
conference with you, Neale, Matt and Eric on the line to flange down exactly=
=20
what Eric recalls having happened.  I do not know whether Eric was also=20
involved in negotiating the charter party terms, but if he was, that makes=20
him an even  more important witness.  Matt, may I leave this with you to set=
=20
up? =20

 3.   You preliminarily felt that, as Neale recently suggested, ECT may have=
=20
a case against the ultimate owners of the vessel that may not be subject to=20
the charter party terms.  This is based on the applicable B/L,, which you=20
have not yet had a chance to review, but which you were told the Master=20
signed on his own behalf (rather than on behalf of Mitsubishi).  If you=20
recommend that ECT pursue the owners, then ECT will need to seize the vessel=
=20
and obtain a letter of undertaking from its P&I club.  Ultimately, ECT would=
=20
then proceed with litigation, probably in the jurisdiction where the seizure=
=20
took place, or, if the parties agreed, by arbitration.  This would be=20
separate and apart from arbitration against Mitsubishi.

 Meanwhile, I authorized you to proceed with retaining a ship tracking=20
service to locate the vessel.  I await your formal recommendation as to=20
whether we should seize the ship, and the particulars regarding local counse=
l=20
and expected costs.

 4. You will send a draft statement of ECT's position to Matt to forward to=20
Mitsubishi, to the effect that ECT feels it owes Mitsubishi nothing for the=20
additional freight or demurrage, given that it was all caused by=20
contamination of the cargo onboard the ship.  I will ask for authority for=20
you to send this to Mitsubishi and revert as soon as I can.

 5.  You are reviewing the FGPC/ECT contract and surrounding circumstances=20
and will provide us your views in due course.


Many thanks for your help.


      Regards,


      Britt Davis=20
