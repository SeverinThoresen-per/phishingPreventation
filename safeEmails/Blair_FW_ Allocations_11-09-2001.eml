Before you write the request, please make these clarifications:

1. If we allocated during timely,  then don't allocate again during any intr=
aday cycles,
    do we count that as being a day that was allocated ?
2. Ventura receipt and delivery are currently being allocated separately, an=
d not netted against=20
    each other like everything else.  Does it count if  either side got allo=
cated ?
3. If a point is in a group that is being allocated, but the point itself is=
 not, does it count ?
4. Percentages ?

Yes this data can be extracted from TMS.  Just send a req. to TMS on Call so=
 they can get the information for you.  I am not sure what you mean by perce=
ntages.

Toby, does Northern track the number of days and associated percentages that=
 a point is allocated during a heating season?  We are trying to do a transp=
ort deal and the customer asked how often we allocated POI 5532 (Eagle) and =
POI 192 (Ventura) last heating season.
