NERC is apparently moving forward aggressively on their initiative to restri=
ct access to market information.  Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN =
Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and =
NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.  A=
 new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged t=
hat marketers have "higher turnover" and "loose lips," and were using this a=
s a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (poten=
tially even from legitimate consumers like us).

If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our =
opinions on this issue.  It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed=
 sufficiently.  Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC mee=
ting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?  I =
think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry =
"de facto" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is con=
sent (even if we're not told about the changes).  We should probably talk ab=
out this all today on our conference call.
