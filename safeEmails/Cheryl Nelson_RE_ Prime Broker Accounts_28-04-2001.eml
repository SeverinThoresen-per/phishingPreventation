Thanks Cheryl.

I need only ensure the funds we will need in order to meet the margin call a=
t=20
Morgan is ready.



David,

I expect the needed margin at Morgan to be under $30mm once we move our long=
s=20
out.  Morgan has today agreed to 25% for shorts (from an average of 50%).  O=
f=20
the $30mm needed half is already at Goldman and Bear. =20

I anticipate therefore no more than $15mm in needed funds.  It may in fact b=
e=20
less I will true up tomorrow

Can we get this by next week, and allow Cheryl to proceed full steam?



Thanks,

Tom

Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on=20
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on=20
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for=20
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it=20
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete)=20
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or=20
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the=20
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was=20
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move=20
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Tom=20
