Richard, here's the latest thinking on the FGPC/ECT liquid fuel agreement=20
conflict. In brief, it looks like we have an argument, but it is too early t=
o=20
tell whether we have the better argument. =20

=46rom David Best.

You  asked  for  a  preliminary  opinion following our telephone conference=20
this
morning on Enron?s contractual remedies and exposures on the FGPC contract.

I am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answer.

First,  we  should start with the contract which I have now read.  I am=20
assuming
the  NDC  date  has  passed,  but  not  the  conversion date.  Article 4.3 i=
s=20
an
acknowledgment  by  the  seller  that  the  buyer?s preference is for=20
condensate
because of favourable tax considerations.  There is however an unfettered=20
option
given by Article 4.4. to Enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the for=
m=20
of
gasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specifications.

The quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in Appendix A.

Article 8.1 under the abbreviation T provides for a liquid fuel tax=20
differential
which  is  a  price  burden  falling  on Enron as part of the price=20
formulation.
However,  ?in  the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using=20
reasonable
commercial efforts, but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead, T shal=
l=20
be
deemed to be zero for the first 600,000 barrels (in the aggregate) of such=20
other
types of liquid fuel delivered in a contract year.?

Other relevant Articles are 10.2 (buyer?s right to secure alternative=20
supplies),
the   whole   of  Article  10  (seller?s  default),  the  whole  of  Article=
 =20
13
(determination  of  quantity  and  quality),  12.4  (mitigation  of losses),=
=20
and
13.3(a)  (?buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any=20
quantity
of liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications ??).

No  doubt  there  are  other relevant Articles, but the above seem the=20
important
ones to me.

The  facts  have  been summarised already in numerous e-mails and=20
correspondence
and  I  certainly will not repeat them, except to say that I think it is=20
correct
that:

(1)   It is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method D3605=
=20
for
condensate.   For this reason, for example, your contract with Phillips=20
Brothers
for the ?PACIFIC VIRGO? did not include this test method.

(2)   SGS  consider  D3605  is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have=20
said
that  modifying  D3605  with  ?ashing? is the preferred method to achieve=20
higher
reproduceability.   Indeed,  the  previous two cargoes of condensate supplie=
d=20
to
FGPC have been tested using ?ashing?.

(3)   The gasoil has been nominated for August to replace the contaminated=20
Elang
arguably  because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of=20
condensate,
but  more  probably  because  the trader in question understandably is=20
concerned
that  a  substitute  condensate cargo may fail if the plain D3605 test metho=
d=20
is
used.

(4)   FGCP  have  said  in  a  recent e-mail dated 27th July that ?FGCP will=
=20
not
hesitate  to  reject  any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed=20
specification
and  which  offers  any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or=20
warranties
given  by  Siemens?.  They are therefore not prepared to entertain any=20
amendment
to the contract.

Following our telephone conference, and having read the contract, I saw=20
problems
for  Enron  and  decided  to  share  my thoughts with John Lockey of Essex=20
Court
Chambers.   He  is the barrister specialising in such problems, often used b=
y=20
me
and  the firm for second opinions, and obviously helpful on a case such as=20
this.
We debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative=20
conclusions
which  I  shall  put  in  bullet form.  He and I are available for discussio=
n=20
at
08.30  a.m. tomorrow at my office and I propose to call you at that time to=20
hear
your comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following:

1.   We  think  that  it  is  not possible for Enron to argue with any=20
realistic
prospect  of  success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller wh=
o=20
is
willing  to  sell  condensate  applying  test method D3605 satisfies the tes=
t=20
of
using  reasonable  commercial  efforts to justify zero tax for the first=20
600,000
barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year.  It seems to us=20
that
this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate=20
cargoes
due  to  force  majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered=20
into
and is not designed to provide effectively a let-out because the contract=20
simply
cannot be complied with at all from its start.  FGPC will simply argue with=20
some
prospect  of  success,  that they entered into the contract and agreed its=20
terms
regarding  pricing,  etc.  on the basis that Enron was able to supply=20
condensate
applying  D3605.   This  squares with what they have said in their recent=20
e-mail
which I have quoted above.  The same e-mail goes on to say:

?The  allowance  for 600,000 barrels was built into the LFPC to act as a=20
?safety
valve? only to be used should circumstances demand it.?

2.   If  we  are right about what we say above, this means that Enron are in=
=20
the
invidious  position  of  having  to  source  condensate  (to avoid the tax),=
=20
not
knowing whether it is going to meet D3605.  If SGS test using D3605 and fail=
=20
the
cargo, the contract supposedly gives FGPC an entitlement to reject.  Their=20
cover
costs could include gasoil with its additional tax as a ?cost? since there i=
s=20
no
available  condensate  for  sale  on  the market applying D3605, assuming we=
=20
are
right about this assumption in (1) above.

3.   It  occurs  to  us  that  it  may be possible to argue with some merit=20
that
Appendix  B  has  to  be  construed  to  imply a term that D3605 only applie=
s=20
to
condensate if it is truly applicable to that grade.  You will note that=20
Appendix
B  sets  out  a  test  method in one column and three grades gasoil, naphtha=
=20
and
condensate  in  other  columns.   If  SGS  are  right  that  the  test metho=
d=20
is
inappropriate, they should not be testing against D3605 for condensate. =20
Putting
it  another  way,  the  condensate  could  be  on  spec applying the=20
appropriate
?ashing?  method, and the test method set out in Appendix B will not=20
necessarily
determine  this.  As you say, it is hit and miss.  Objectively, the intentio=
n=20
of
the parties must be to apply the appropriate test method, or not to apply a=20
test
method  if  it  is  not  capable  of  determining the contractual=20
specification.
Applying  this  reasoning,  it means that Enron are not in breach by=20
supplying a
cargo  of condensate in circumstances where the D3605 test is simply not=20
carried
out because contractually it cannot apply.

4.  As we say above, we think SGS should not be carrying out this test at al=
l=20
if
it is entirely inappropriate.  Indeed, SGS, who are jointly appointed, shoul=
d=20
be
instructed  by Enron not to carry out the test.  There is some force for thi=
s=20
in
Article  13.1(a) which says that measurement of quantities and taking of=20
samples
for  the  purposes  of  determining  the quality of liquid fuel in each=20
shipment
should be carried out ?in accordance with international standard practice at=
=20
the
time  of  the  shipment  in question?.   It is not completely on point since=
=20
the
clause  does  not deal specifically with testing.  In the event that SGS=20
confirm
it is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test, the=20
buyer
will  be  left  without  any test certificate that shows the cargo has faile=
d=20
to
meet  the quality specifications.  Should subsequently the buyer test on his=
=20
own
under D3605 and it fails, whilst SGS independently apply the ?ashing? method=
=20
and
it passes, we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a=20
lawful
rejection.

5.   Before  this  angle is pursued, we think SGS should be contacted to=20
confirm
the test method is inappropriate.  We also think it is important that you an=
d=20
we
have sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its fac=
e=20
it
is  inappropriate  for  condensate.  This would help to reinforce the=20
contention
that it is inapplicable to condensate in Appendix B.

6.   Finally,  I should like to have sight of the Appendix 1 ?Typical=20
laboratory
condensate  analyses?  that  is  attached to the fuel supply plan that you=20
faxed
yesterday.

We look forward to speaking to you at 08.30 a.m. tomorrow.

Regards,

David Best.
