Rick:  In addition to our normal activities related to board reporting, Port=
RAC maintenance, compliance and SWAT work, we have the following major proje=
ct initiatives underway:

DASH SPENDING CONTROLS - We are leading the team to develop an "AFE-type" co=
st accumulation system so that every project in Enron will have accurate and=
 timely cost expenditure numbers to ensure that appropriate DASH's and appro=
val levels have been obtained.

BANKRUPTCY REPORTING DATA - We have taken responsibility for developing the =
reporting function for the new bankruptcy group.  We are working with Michae=
l T. and Credit to develop what data we need, where in the organization we g=
et it and what kind of reports we generate with it.

POST TRANSACTION REVIEWS -  We will provide the primary resources to perform=
 these Board mandated reviews.  Paper mills, Garden State and Daishowa will =
be reviewed this quarter in conjuction with Underwriting.

EES - We are working with Credit to monitor the EES project list as well as =
assisting them in some counterparty and credit scoring work related to EES's=
 mass marketing effort.

PortRAC ENHANCEMENTS - We have completed the executive demos with very posit=
ive comments about the functionality of the system.  Some of them (including=
 Louise Kitchen) commented that they missed their hard copy snapshots so we =
are enhancing PortRAC to make it easier to print an entire snapshot book for=
 a business unit with the "push of a button".

If you have any other "big" projects that you want us to tackle, please let =
me know.   Thanks,     Rick C.
