Just in case this is news to you, I've spoken with Ben Gwaltney (A/P) in=20
Houston about processing rebates.  He explained that when applying for the=20
rebate, have the rebate check payable to Enron.  Send the rebate check in on=
=20
a Deposit Transmittal Form, and code it with the same codes you had used to=20
process the initial expense (company #, expense code and cost center to whic=
h=20
the rebate should be credited).  If a Deposit Transmittal Form is unavailabl=
e=20
to you, you can just staple the check to a piece of paper showing the=20
appropriate codes.  Mail this deposit form with the rebate check via=20
inter-company mail to:  Treasury, Sam Round EB2703.

If I've left someone off of this message who would find this information=20
helpful, please pass it on.

Have a good weekend!=20
Anna
