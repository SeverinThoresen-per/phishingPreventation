Brent,

As I anticipated, Lavarato seems to want to get started with financial=20
transactions in Argentina as soon as possible.  The boys told me that once=20
they have the document they would take it on some sort of road show in order=
=20
to get input from the market prior to putting it on line.  In order to do so=
,=20
they have requested certain "flexibility" regarding the terms of the=20
agreement that the prospective CP's may want to have changed.  They=20
understood and agreed that the concept behind the contracts on EOL is that=20
they are standardized and are not intended to be modified upon CP's request=20
once they are on line.

Also, we need to confirm that this document can be used both online and=20
"offline".   Did you get a chance to take a look at the changes?

Regards,


Andrea
