Rob, further to your two e-mails regarding the discouraging sentiments=20
expressed at the IMO Board meeting,  Garrett and I had a very productive=20
meeting with Tony Dean, the Assistant Deputy Minister and Assistant Secretar=
y=20
of Cabinetand his colleague, Frank Denton, Director, Economic Policy in the=20
Cabinet Office.  Dean  was identified by Bill Hawkins as a key voice on the=20
electricity file.  He is someone I have been trying to see for two months. =20
He was very impressed by Garrett's presentation.  His comments were as=20
follows:  a) the mood in gov't is changing; b)  the  political environment=20
several months ago (California, high gas prices, and complaining industrials=
)=20
made it very difficult for the gov't to be making a decision at that time  t=
o=20
move forward with market opening; c) Enron's message  has been getting=20
through" very effectively" (his words) ; and d) the political environment ha=
s=20
moderated considerably: the differences from California are understood, gas=20
prices have come off, and Pickering is evidently  on track.   He emphasized=20
that the gov't's announcement on April  23 was "by" May 2002.=20

Aleck, re OPG and Pickering - too complicated of a message re Harris meeting=
=2E=20
As per Lavo, he wants 5 simple/straightforward and concise messages that we=20
can get accross to Harris. It needs to be short, to the point, concise, and=20
simple. By cc to Paul, Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY (you and=20
Aleck need to agree on the speaking points - I provided you with my comments=

already).=20

One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate t=
o=20
you - At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or=20
one muni is not ready - the market will not open. I lost my mind, and told=20
him that if that is the case, I need to resign as this is a complete waste o=
f=20
time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace=20
that one rinky-dink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage. Without=

Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three=20
points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO=20
Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving=

Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Fou=
r=20
Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that=20
Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior=20
people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in=20
electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (an=
d=20
the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the=20
Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering=20
A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling=
=20
stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the=20
government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize=
=20
prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the=
=20
Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waitin=
g=20
until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's=20
financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the=20
concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern ma=
y=20
be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim "force majeure" in respect of the=20
Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition=20
of "force majeure"  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even i=
f=20
OPG  can claim "force majeure",  the predetermined "force majeure replacemen=
t=20
cost" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to=20
offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In othe=
r=20
words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market=20
development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe=
,=20
from OPG's perspective, now a "bad deal") that OPG made in 1999.  We should=20
discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without=20
compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward=20
Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and=20
day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this=20
will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is=
=20
a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away=
=20
from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have bee=
n=20
working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material=20
get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event,=

I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board=20

Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:

 - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the=
=20
1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news=20
is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should=20
have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March=20
was highly probable.

 - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck=
=20
I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.

 - Forward Market development - IMO "wants to make this happen". Assessing=20
two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a=20
conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward=20
market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked=
=20
re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a jok=
e=20
(WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market=20
transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We=20
need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market=20
place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned wit=
h=20
creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie=20
information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want=20
to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this=20
already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.
