Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in =
Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services cont=
ract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cash=
out the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on =
the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move=
 the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  W=
e need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.=20

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the E=
le compressors. =20

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them. =20

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli kee=
p us informed of what the new deal will look like.
