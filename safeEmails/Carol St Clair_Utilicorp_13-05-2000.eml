Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective=20
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make=20
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by=20
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective=20
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the=20
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks. =20
Thanks.
Carol
