Stations 3,4 and 5.  I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, No=
vember 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies o=
f all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending =
the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Althoug=
h Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have t=
he responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny=
 said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's bus=
iness but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I as=
ked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it wou=
ld be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you appri=
sed of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.=
