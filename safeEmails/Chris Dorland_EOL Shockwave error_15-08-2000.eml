Torrey/Mark,

Below is the error message Chris gets when logging in to EOL. If we hit Yes=20
it keeps coming back with the same error. (Sometimes it works though... you=20
figure it out). If you hit No, the browser session freezes up.

We have done the following:

Uninstalled/Reinstalled Shockwave
Reinstalled browser


Please look at this ASAP since he needs to be able to see the customer scree=
n.

Thanks,

Attila
