Hello, Ryan.  I got your e-mail address from Kevin Dumas.  I want to discuss=
=20
with you an issue we have at a tower lease site.  HPL is currently leasing=20
tower space from REB Communications in Gilmer, Texas.  Our operator, HMS,=20
discovered this week that the tower was not in compliance with FCC=20
regulations.  The most critical issue is that the tower lights do not appear=
=20
to be functional.  HMS has recommended that HPL remove it's equipment from=20
the tower and  cancel our FCC license immediately.=20

I would like to protect the interests of both HPL and AEP, and I would=20
appreciate your suggestion on what to do with the equipment licence.  I do=20
not want to do anything to jeopardize the closing of the HPL sale.  Please=20
call me at 713.853.6250, or e-mail me at cheryl.marshall@enron.com, so we ca=
