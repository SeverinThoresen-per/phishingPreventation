Sam,

We are moving forward to execute the ITG Quantex agreement now that the fina=
l=20
revisions were approved.  Sheila has forwarded a revised version of the=20
document for Gary Hickerson to sign.  Please make sure that, once Gary signs=

the two copies, they are both forwarded to Cassandra Shultz for signature. =20
Then, I think, Selena said she would send to ITG, but make sure.

I am hoping we get signatures tomorrow; I will be out of the office all day=20
tomorrow -- traveling to New York and will not return until 10 a.m. Tuesday=20
