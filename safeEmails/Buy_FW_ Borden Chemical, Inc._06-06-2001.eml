Bjorn:

Many thanks for your role in yesterday's meeting with Borden Chemical.  It w=
as most appropriate for you to follow-up with Ed and Bob, and skillfully sti=
ck-handle the opportunity in the adept manner you did.  As we discussed, it'=
s hard to guess what direction the company will choose to take going forward=
, but I believe we gave it a good shot.  I spoke with Alan, and he will call=
 Ed and/or Bob later in the week to see what their thoughts are, given time =
for reflection.  If we do not hear back from Bob by mid-next week, I will ca=
ll him.  =20

Thank you again,
skb
