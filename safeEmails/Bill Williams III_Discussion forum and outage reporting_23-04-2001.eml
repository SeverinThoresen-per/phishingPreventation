Group,

Our discussion forum notes as a group are significantly improved in the past=
=20
3 weeks in many areas.  I believe communication in the group at shift change=
s=20
is improving and is quite good in general.  However, there is always room fo=
r=20
more improvement.  Specifically, other traders in the group and on the floor=
=20
would benefit from more detailed information regarding outages.  Please try=20
to include the reason for a plant derate as well as the ETR when a unit is=20
lost.  I would also highly recommend notifying the cash desk in the region=20
affected by the outage, either by email or verbally.  An important outage wa=
s=20
recently missed by both the real-time group and another cash desk on the=20
floor.  Real-time had ready access to the information concerning the outage=20
but did not pass that information on to others in the group at the shift=20
change or others on the floor.  In this case, such poor communication simply=
=20
made us look foolish.  We work hard for (and justly deserve) the solid=20
reputation we have on the floor.  Let's make sure we do the little things to=
=20
maintain it.=20

Again, keep up the good work.
Bill
