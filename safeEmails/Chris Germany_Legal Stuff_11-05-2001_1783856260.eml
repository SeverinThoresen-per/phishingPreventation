Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by=
 Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a termin=
ation ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in=
 this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.  IF Ma=
ry agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   I've =
learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I w=
ill be.  BE NICE NOW.
