Sally,

I just left a message with Chris Hanz and Steve Stock who are both Sr.=20
Directors under Beth Perlman.  Given the office visit schedules - Chris and=20
Steve will likely only be available at the following times:

Chris to meet with Chris Hoyle  After 10:30 a.m.
Steve to meet with John Rodgers From 1:00 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.


I will let you know as soon as I hear from them and confirm.

Thanks,
Ashley
