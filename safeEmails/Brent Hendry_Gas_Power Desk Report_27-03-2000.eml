should talk to?
Thanks,
Brent

Subject: Gas/Power Desk Report

We are planning to begin a weekly report on the gas/power/ other energy=20
markets in Argentina.  This is common practice with ECT NA and Europe.  What=
=20
legal hurdles do we have other than including a disclaimer at the bottom (or=
=20
top) of every report??  This should be easy to determine by talking with=20
counsel in Houston, no??  We want to start sending these reports out within=20
the next two weeks (pre-winter) to both current and potential customers.

Thanks,
