Subject:	Factor Loadings for VAR
Importance:	High

Please explain why factor loadings were put into production yesterday withou=
t approval.

Please roll back last night's changes immediately.

We intend to sign off the factors today and if acceptable they should be loa=
ded today.

In future if you don't have my signature on a piece of paper, no new factors=
 go in.=20

What I require to make the decision is as follows:

1	The new correlations per the numerical method
2	The old correlations
3	A summary of primary curves
4	A summary of major positions
5	The resulting incremental change in VAR, by commodity, desk and/or major p=
osition
6	Evidence of a discourse with the appropriate desk heads/book admins about =
the change

Beth, lets add this to the list of tasks for the Global Middle Office and ag=
ree transition.
