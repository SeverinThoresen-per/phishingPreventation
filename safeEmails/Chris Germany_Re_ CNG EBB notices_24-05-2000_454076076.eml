APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE

POSTED May 23, 2000

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing=
=20
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative=
=20
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you=20
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our=20
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression=20
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a=20
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make=20
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a=20
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and=20
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for=20
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE=20
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405.  =20
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental=
=20
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental=20
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the=20
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. =20
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it=20
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably=20
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering=20
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the=20
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the=20
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. =20
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing=20
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure=20
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other=20
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression=20
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the right=
s=20
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more=20
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for=20
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the=20
proposed=20
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include=20
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression=20
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,=20
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should=20
be included (please print or type).

    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a=20
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the=20
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after=20
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. =20
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close=20
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value=20
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on=20
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at=20
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may=20
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering=
