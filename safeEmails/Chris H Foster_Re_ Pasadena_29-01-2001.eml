You quoted $5.10 as the total spread you would pay.

So:  $6 + $5.1 =3D $11.10

Question:  What is the credit you will give Pasadena time their capactiy of=20
3886 MMBtu/d?

Answer:
To figure out what you are paying for the capacity:

Assume SJ Index =3D 6.00

Then,=20
Basin Price/(1 - Fuel %) + Variable Cost + Demand Charge (Kim's # for=20
Pasadena) =3D Border Index

Demand Charge =3D Border Index - $.026 - (Basin Price/(1- .0388))=20

x =3D 11.10 - .026 - 6.00/(.9612)

11.10 - .0266 - 6.2422

$4.83 is the implied demand charge=20

$4.83 * 3,886 * 29 =3D Total Credit=20
