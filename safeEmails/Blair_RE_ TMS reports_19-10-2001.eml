	Lisa,

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype o=
f the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of=
 the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, t=
he universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok=
 with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?
