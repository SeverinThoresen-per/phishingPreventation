I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we=
 allocate capital and risk. Counterparties are very nervous and many are not=
 extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, =
both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:

-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.

For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy =
physical to cover an option with Koch.=20

We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast. I will try=
 to set up a meeting tomorrow.

Rick
