Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially=20
since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you=20
might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the=20
English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle. =20

There are differences between British English and American English that I've=
=20
noticed so far:

Pants are "trousers."  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, "Black=20
Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into=20
the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in "trousers" not pants=
=20
with a smirk.  "Pants" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost=20
fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said "PANTS!"=
=20
and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's=20
the equivalent of saying "CRAP!"

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some=20
orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said "with extra=20
bits" and some said "no bits."  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained=20
that it was "with pulp" or "without pulp." =20

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are "chips" on the=20
menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called "crisps."  If you want to get=
=20
a baked potato it's called a "jacket potato."    And if you want mashed=20
potatoes, just say "mash."  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars=
)=20
here is "bangers and mash" which translates to sausages links and mashed=20
potatoes. =20

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you "stand in queue."
Trash cans are "bins."  It's amusing to hear someone say, "I don't want it-=20
just bin it."
Country boy or redneck types are called "wide boys" or "barrow boys."
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced "zed" and H is pronounced=20
"haitch."
Cross walks are "zebra crossings"  since they are signified by white stripes=
=20
on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called "tights" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced "goote."
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the=20
fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you=20
are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( "Thanks")
Angie
