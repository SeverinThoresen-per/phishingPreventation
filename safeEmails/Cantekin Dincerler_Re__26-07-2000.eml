Vince,
Sorry for getting back a little late. I have been in touch with Kirstee to=20
figure out how to treat positions data which is the primary cause for=20
fluctuations. Apparently, as of 7/19, MG still has July position. This may b=
e=20
spot or balance of the month, or some settlement issue. This indeed is what=20
we are trying to find out/verify (it may be an error too). Kirstee is going=20
to get back to me on this. If it is not an error, then Anjam's latest result=
s=20
($5.5 million total VAR) are reasonable given all the assumptions and the=20
missing pieces. I will keep you posted.

Cantekin,

Can you figure out the reason for cocoa beans VaR fluctuations?
The same is true of aluminum. I assume this is the position change.

Anjam and Kirstee,


As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. Th=
e=20
first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver=
=20
prices, the second column is your VAR with 7/19 position and dummy=20
gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19=20
position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of=20
numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page. Please refer to=20
MODELVAR2000.xls that I have sent you for gold & silver prices and=20
volatilities.=20

Thank you,
Cantekin
