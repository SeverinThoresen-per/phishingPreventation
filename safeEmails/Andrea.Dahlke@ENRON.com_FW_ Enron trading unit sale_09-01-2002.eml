Creditors Ask Bankruptcy Judge to Delay Sale of Enron's Trading Business    =

Updated: Wednesday, January 9, 2002 12:32 PM ET     =20
Dow Jones Newswires=20
NEW YORK -- Even before an auction of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s trading busines=
s later this week, creditors are lining up to oppose the sale.=20
Creditors are concerned about how Enron (ENE, news, msgs) will allocate mone=
y from that auction to its bankrupt units, and are asking federal bankruptcy=
 judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to oppose, or at least delay, an approval of the s=
ale, which was to come as early as Friday. =20
More than 15 companies have now filed motions asking the U.S. Bankruptcy Cou=
rt for the Southern District of New York to delay the approval of any offer =
for Enron's power-trading business, which was by far the largest and most pr=
ofitable operation of the vast company. The companies want time to figure ou=
t which assets are up for sale, which of the more than 3,000 Enron affiliate=
s and other entities will benefit from the sale and how various creditors wi=
ll be affected.=20
Under a plan to bring back some value to its now moribund trading operations=
, including EnronOnline -- which until not so long ago accounted for 25% of =
all wholesale energy trading in the U.S. -- Enron is seeking a 51% joint-ven=
ture partner to form a new company dubbed New Energy Trading Company, or NET=
CO.=20
Enron plans to contribute its trading software and hardware, among other thi=
ngs, to the joint venture in exchange for a 49% share. So far, Citigroup Inc=
=2E (C, news, msgs) and UBS AG (UBS, news, msgs) have been reported to have =
made sealed bids. An auction is scheduled for Thursday.=20
At stake is how cash that may potentially be generated by the sale will be u=
sed.=20
In its motion opposing the sale, for instance, the Royal Bank of Scotland Gr=
oup PLC (RBSB, news, msgs) said, "Absent a disclosure of the intended uses f=
or the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the ben=
efits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries."=20
Further scrutinizing the way Enron has been managing its cash, the Royal Ban=
k of Scotland, one of Enron's large creditors, raises the possibility that E=
nron may have already consolidated cash between different entities before it=
 filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2.=20
"If this anecdote were to be correct, no disclosure has been made [nor has t=
he time necessary to conduct a review elapsed] to the extent, if any, that a=
ny of these businesses stand as a constructive trustee of assets or monies f=
or the benefit of other entities or creditors," the Royal Bank of Scotland s=
tated in a court filing.=20
Gas and electricity trading company Aquila Inc. also expressed concerns abou=
t the use of the proceeds of the trading-assets sale, saying that proceeds o=
f the sale should be put in escrow until it can be determined which units sh=
ould get the money.=20
It isn't the first time that questions have arisen about how Enron will dist=
ribute money coming into the company.=20
Last month, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER, news, msgs) briefly withheld $371 mill=
ion of the distressed company's funds in a brokerage account until Enron and=
 the bankruptcy court could clarify which of the company's entities was enti=
tled to it.=20
The court's verdict: The money will be governed by a centralized cash- manag=
ement system - put in place shortly after Enron filed for bankruptcy - under=
 which all funds collected by any Enron entity are swept up to the parent an=
d later dispersed accordingly to subsidiaries.=20
For now, this means that any cash generated on settlements to Enron's units =
should be used to pay those units' debtors.=20
But that could change, according to bankruptcy experts, if Enron decides in =
the future to effect a "substantive consolidation" of its assets. This is re=
latively common in Chapter 11 cases, and in essence, would put all of the co=
mpany's assets into one pot to be distributed to a larger circle of creditor=
s.=20
A substantive consolidation, if it eventually occurs, is likely to simplify =
Enron's role in dispersing funds, but may benefit some creditors and put oth=
ers at a disadvantage.=20
Given that the Chapter 11 proceedings are still in the early stages, it is d=
ifficult to gauge whether this is a viable option, said Joel Kay, an attorne=
y who specializes in bankruptcy cases at Hughes, Watters & Askanase LLP, Hou=
ston.=20
Enron attorneys didn't immediately return phone calls seeking comment.=20
There is also another concern.=20
Wiser Oil Co. (WZR, news, msgs), a creditor who is owed about $7 million und=
er oil- and gas-hedging contracts with the Enron North America unit, believe=
s that Enron's $ 1.5 billion debtor-in-possession financing could mean bad n=
ews for the beleaguered company's subsidiary.=20
"The concern is that Enron North America's assets are being pledged as colla=
teral to secure repayment of the DIP facility even though it's unclear how m=
uch, if any, of the DIP borrowing will actually go to this unit," said Debor=
ah A. Reperowitz, of Reed Smith LLP, which represents Wiser.=20
So far, Enron hasn't drawn on its DIP facility, which is led by J.P. Morgan =
and Citigroup. But if the company does, and there are insufficient funds to =
repay this loan in the future, then Enron North America's assets may be on t=
he hook, according to Ms. Reperowitz.=20
Wiser, in a filing late Tuesday, also objected to the court's expected appro=
val of the sale of a portion of Enron's energy-trading unit. Energy trading =
accounted for about 90% of Enron's $101 billion in revenue last year.=20
The sale shouldn't be allowed to go through because the "timing and terms" m=
ake it impossible for creditors to determine which assets are to be sold, th=
e value of these assets and where proceeds will be allocated, Wiser said.=20
Other entities that have expressed concern about the sale in recent court fi=
lings include General Electric Co.'s (GE, news, msgs) General Electric Capit=
al Corp., Pure Resources Inc. (PRS, news, msgs), Tenaska Marketing Ventures,=
 Forest Oil Corp. (FST, news, msgs), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN, news, msgs), M=
agnum Hunter Production Inc., Petro-Hunt LLC and Spinnaker Exploration Co. (=
SKE, news, msgs), Exco Resources Inc. (EXCO, news, msgs), Eco-Tankship Inc.,=
 Powerex Corp., and El Paso Corp.'s (EPG, news, msgs) El Paso Merchant Energ=
y LP.=20
