Hello, Michelle!
=20
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book d=
eal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no prob=
lem re the confidentiality agreement.=20
=20
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years a=
nd have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their =
editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building ex=
periences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minist=
er / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
=20
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.
=20
All The Best,
Bill
