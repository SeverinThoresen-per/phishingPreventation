Mark, David;
Enron Corp is expecting 590,609.20 ($463,609.20 + $127,000.00) from ECT. =20
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk=
=20
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.

Summary
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of=20
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron=20
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months. =20
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated=20
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to=20
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting=20
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was=
=20
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment=20
is $121,080.16. =20

Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their book=
s=20
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada=20
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT.=

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August=20

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment=20
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16.  This adjustment however was reversed=20
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in=20
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company wa=
s=20
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it=

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we ar=
e=20
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system=20
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to=20
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct. =20

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what=20
the amount would be.  Thanks,

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting=
=20
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's=20
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production=20
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to=
=20
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to=20
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)=20
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366. =
=20
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez. =
=20
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait=20
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on=
=20
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?
