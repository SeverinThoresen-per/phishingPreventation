Matt,

1. I'm on the same page as Janice with regard to testing, although I'd like=20
to spin out my thoughts a bit.  In my view, at the end of the day, it is=20
virtually inevitable that both D3605 with ashing and D3605 without ashing ar=
e=20
going to be used on the critical loadport sample (and, therefore, for the=20
rest of the samples as well ) at the joint analysis. =20

 Mitsubishi's strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining=20
loadport sample to come up off-spec on retesting, for obvious reasons. =20

 Prior to the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will be aware that (a) D3605 withou=
t=20
ashing is in the FGH contract and that (b) ECT believes D3605 without ashing=
=20
may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product.  Given this, if=20
ECT proposes to use only D3605 with ashing (our safest bet) on the loadport=20
sample at the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D360=
5=20
without ashing.   The same would apply, I think, if even if ECT proposed to=20
use only D3605 without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis.  The=20
more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run,=
=20
the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is=20
off-spec.  Mitsubishi's goal will be supported by the general practice of th=
e=20
chemists involved, who will want to rerun every test previously run in order=
=20
to get to the bottom of this. =20

 My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT=
=20
to credibly take the position that only one test or the other (D3605 with=20
ashing or D3605 without ashing) should be run; in fact, in light of what I=20
believe is virtually inevitable (Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we=20
don't propose), and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned=20
about the reproducibility problem, my feeling is that we may want to go ahea=
d=20
and propose both tests to Mitsubishi (assuming that it is expected that we=20
would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi, and not the other wa=
y=20
around).

2. Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the hands-on testing of thi=
s=20
product in Singapore?  I know that we nominated SGS Singapore, but does this=
=20
necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work, as=20
opposed to us just using SGS's lab?  As Janice pointed out, we need to make=20
absolutely sure that (a) the lab is first-class and (b) whoever performs the=
=20
test this time is very experienced with D3605 with and without ashing.  Also=
,=20
it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of=20
the pre-sale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo.  This latter=20
point, especially, needs to be handled with great care; if there is a need t=
o=20
communicate with SGS about any of this, I would suggest that you first confe=
r=20
with David or Neal.

Many thanks for your help.

 Again, many thanks for your help.

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done,=
=20
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same=20
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  No=
t=20
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper"=20
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that=20
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds=20
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at=20
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo -=
-=20
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole=20
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I=20
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or=
=20
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about=
=20
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).  =

Matt,
=20
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of=
=20
us will get back to you. =20

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing=20
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the=20
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely fro=
m=20
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605=20
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were=20
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods=20
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in=20
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary=20
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with=20
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without=20
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for=20
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand=20
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has=20
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt=20
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo),=20
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and=20
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue,=20
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang=20
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this=20
e-mail.=20

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end=
=20
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt=
,=20
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want=
=20
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by=20
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important=20
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are=20
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was=20
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another=
=20
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it=20
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel=20
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First=20
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument ma=
y=20
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we=20
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing woul=
d=20
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample=20
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minto=
n=20
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club.=
=20
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to=20
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing=20
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas,=20
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method=20
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That=20
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it i=
s=20
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas.=20

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D360=
5=20
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to us=
e=20
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test=20
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want t=
o=20
have his input for the contamination issue.=20

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt
