Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Ac=
tion Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with=
 DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look =
pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kid=
s in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any imp=
lications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change ar=
ound here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have)=
 for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.
