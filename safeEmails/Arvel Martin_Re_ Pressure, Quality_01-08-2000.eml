I don't know if anyone has the pressure data your looking for, but Ken would=
=20
be the man to track it down.
We took samples of our production, upstream of the Wild Horse San Arroyo=20
plant, but do not yet have the analysis back. Should have tomorrow.
Re the sample taken downstream of Wild Horse S.A. plant, I was told that it=20
met dew point spec, but we have been unable to obtain the actual written tes=
t=20
results. It appears that Wild Horse is withholding that information.

Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure=20
is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the=20
contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data? =20
Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data. =20

Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks=20
for your help.
