John,
Would it be possible for you to assign one person that is easily accessible =
to provide Jesus with indicative pricing for Empress throughout the month?  =
Possibly Ryan Watt? Maybe you could include Jesus on an email distribution l=
ist (if there is such a thing) to provide him with indicatives.  We have one=
 customer in particular that likes kicking tires, and Jesus doesn't like bot=
hering you guys all the time for him.   =20
