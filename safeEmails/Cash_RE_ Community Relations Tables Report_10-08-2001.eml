Subject: Community Relations Tables Report


Hello Everyone:
=20
As you may know, Community Relations sends the "Tables Report" on a weekly b=
asis. This is a detailed list that includes information about the tables whi=
ch Enron has purchased to support various non-profits. If an Enron employee =
has volunteered to fill a table, their name will appear in the far right col=
umn. Please share this information with the Executive with which you work, a=
s we would like to utilize every table that we buy. When an Enron employee v=
olunteers to fill a table, we encourage them to leverage it by inviting co-w=
orkers, customers, community leaders, etc.=20
=20
If you volunteer to fill a table, it is important that you immediately let m=
e know, and I will serve as the liaison with the non-profit organization.

Attached is the updated Community Relations Tables Report.  If you have any =
questions, please feel free to call me directly.

Thanks,

Hilda Bourgeois-Galloway, CPS
