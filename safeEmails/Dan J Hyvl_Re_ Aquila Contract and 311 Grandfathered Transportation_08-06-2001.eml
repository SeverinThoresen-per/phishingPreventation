Melissa,
 The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation=20
service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which=
=20
would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a=
=20
city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In=20
HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin=20
component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas=20
Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as=20
provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its=20
maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues=
=20
to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can=20
probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have=20
concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have=20
such information.

 Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact=20
Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract.

Dan,

Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila Energy
Marketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their master
contract.  Per Kathy, this HPL contract has been in negotiations for almost
a year, and they are very close to finalizing.  Her phone number is:
816-527-1560.

Also, at yesterday's meeting regarding the various AEP Entities, you
mentioned that HPL has 311 Transportation with a Grandfathered Rate.  Do
you have any documentation regarding this arrangement, or can you refer me
to the person that could provide this?

Thank you,
Melissa Graves
