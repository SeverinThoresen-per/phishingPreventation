Hello  All,
=20
Els  gave birth to our healthy daughter Laura last Tuesday. It went almost  =
perfect. Labour started at 15.00 and at 19.05 Laura was there.  Unfortunatel=
y we had to go to the hospital at 21.30 because Els was still losing  some b=
lood. It was not much of a problem and she could return home the next  morni=
ng.

Attached some photo's of the new  one.
