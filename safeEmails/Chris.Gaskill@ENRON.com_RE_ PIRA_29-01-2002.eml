Hunter/Fletch,

Danielle Marcinkowski in the market data group has been discussing a new arr=
angement with PIRA.  I was told by the legal group that all contracts with p=
arties such as PIRA need to be negotiated through the market data group.  FY=
I there were outstanding issues in the bankruptcy surrounding the display of=
 reports/data on our website to users that did not have licenses (mainly EGM=
). =20

All that said, we need the Weekly Gas Flash, US Gas Market Forecast, Western=
 Gas Basis Report, and the Daily Electricity report.  We would also like to =
be able to phone PIRA reps with questions, participate in strategic breifing=
s, and have two slots for the PIRA annual energy conference.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris
