Carol:  I apologize for being deliquent in getting you a draft of a waiver=20
letter for our representation of ENA in the ACE insurance transaction, but I=
=20
have had an incredibly hectic two weeks.  This draft is virtually the same a=
s=20
the other waiver letters I have prepared for ENA over the years, with the=20
notable exception of the acknowledgement that certain LLGM lawyers can revie=
w=20
the insurance status of the policy for ACE from an insurance status=20
standpoint.  As you know, I was not particularly thrilled about having us=20
perform that role, but I understand that this issue was vented in=20
considerable detail a week or so ago and agreed to by both parties.  Please=20
let me know if this letter is acceptable to you.  If it is, perhaps you coul=
d=20
just reply to this e-mail and I can then forward an original to you via fax=20
for your signature.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks very=
=20
much for your time and consideration in this respect.  And, thanks for=20
providing us  with the opportunity to work with you on this project.

John
