	On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding ac=
counts receivable
	back to January, 1998.  In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have =
NOT cleaned up very
	many of these issues.
=09
	Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.  =
My expectation is
	that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at wh=
ich time I will
	ask Alice for an update.  Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as need=
ed to help you in
	this effort.

	All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001.
