Hey,

How was your Christmas?  Did you guys get hammered with snow and ice?

My vacation was very relaxing, and I managed to leave just before the real=20
cold weather set in.  It also looks like I'm going to miss the biggest snow=20
storm of the winter by about five days. =20

I'm still not sure what I am going to do for New Year's eve.  It's been so=20
busy this week that I haven't had time to talk to any of my friends.  If you=
=20
hear of anything let me know.

Anyway, since the Nymex closed at Noon, I think I am going to get the heck=20
outta here.

Talk to you later.

Andy
