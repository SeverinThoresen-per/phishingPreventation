Jeff,

Have you had a chance to convey what I said to the group, and can I join?
Professor Aceves was aware that I talked to you about joining your group, an=
d
he sent me an email asking to confirm that I was now in a group. I'd certain=
ly
like to be! As you know, I want to make sure I am in one to do the next
assignment with. Please let me know, so that if I am joining your group I ca=
n
make the meetings and contribute to the next case. I do really appreciate yo=
ur
help. :)

Thanks,
Christine
