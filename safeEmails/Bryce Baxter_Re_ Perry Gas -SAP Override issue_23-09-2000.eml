The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major=20
system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Befor=
e=20
Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the tim=
e=20
SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired th=
e=20
cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.

As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for=20
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify. =20
This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until th=
e=20
payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of=20
September. =20

However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure=20
works.  To ensure we don't "accidentally" release cash, I have asked Unify I=
T=20
to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which=20
will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but i=
s=20
worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday,=
=20
9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand=

the issue.  Did Willie not do his job?  Are there problems with how SAP=20
works?  Are both of these an issue?  Please let me know if we have a far=20

Sally,

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental=20
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was=20
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P=20
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willi=
e=20
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day,=20
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If=20
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give furthe=
r=20
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from=
=20
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.=
 =20
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on=
=20
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell
