   One day when I was feeling gloomy, And in a melancholy mood, I heard a
  voice from out the gloom say 'Cheer up, things could be worse.'  So I
  cheered up and sure enough, things got worse!"

  Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out
  section of  forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The
  deceased
  male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
  back, flippers, and facemask.
  A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from
  massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive
  identification.
  Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver
  ended up in the middle of a forest fire.
  It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a
  diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from the forest. The fire
  fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in
  a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from
  the ocean and then flown to the forest fire and emptied.
  You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the
  Pacific, the next he was doing the breaststroke in a fire-dip-bucket 300
  feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10" of the fire.
  Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.

  STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?

  A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in
  the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
  accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handle
  bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
  motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.
  The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her
  husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next
  to him, and the shattered patio door.
  The wife ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance.
  Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the
  several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her
  husband.
  After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital,
  the wife up righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas
  was  spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the
  petrol, and threw the towels in the toilet. The man was treated and releas=
ed
  to come home.
  Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the
  damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom,
  sat
  down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette,
  he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated.
  His wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her
  husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying
  on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering
  burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.
  His wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
  paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
  paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began   carrying
  him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
  accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
  husband had burned himself.
  She told them, and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of
  them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell
  down
  the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

  Having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse.....

  A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
  frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
  the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
  she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
  his  arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to
  his Walkman!

     And finally.......
  Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
  bomb. It came back with "Return to Sender" stamped on it.  Forgetting it
  was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.
  Now, your day's not so bad, is it .........................? >>
