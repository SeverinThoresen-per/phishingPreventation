Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE =
Discussion List:

For those that are interested, although no scheduling order has been
issued yet by Judge Young in the Northeast RTO case, a quick glance at
FERC's Hearing Room reservation page
(http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/daysched.htm) indicates that Hearing
Rooms 1 and 2 are reserved by Judge Young for Northeast RTO Mediations
on July 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and 31.

Of course the fact that the rooms are reserved does not necessarily mean
that meetings will be held on all of those days. Nevertheless, parties
might be well advised to pack for more than just one overnight next
week, just in case....

Also, as a number of folks have expressed interest in the same question,
I provide the following. On behalf of the Price Responsive Load
Coalition, I have asked Judge Young to provide guidance on whether new
parties will be admitted to the mediation and, if so, whether they can
request party status at the meeting on the 24th. I will share whatever
guidance I receive with this list.

Aaron
