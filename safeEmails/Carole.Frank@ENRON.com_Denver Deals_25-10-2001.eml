Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy O=
il deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in =
our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative=
 Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one=
 is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068=
893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names. =
 The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Ro=
ck Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, =
but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby. =20

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will b=
e.  Thank you!
