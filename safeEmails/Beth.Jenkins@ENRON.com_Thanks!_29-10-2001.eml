Kevin - I just realized I hadn't thanked you for your help in getting the ho=
urly scalars done for power that I required for the proper valuation of my R=
eal Option products.  They are all done. Thanks!

By the way, you had mentioned in your email that they may have some applicat=
ions for EWS.  Is anyone using them up there? =20

Thanks again and happy trading!

Beth
