John,

As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  u=
s=20
isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our=20
code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional applicatio=
n=20
specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource i=
s=20
scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX=20
administrators working along side the Sun resources.

As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side=
=20
of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are=20
putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously=20
impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.

These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very=20
diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in=
=20
additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources=
=20
at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to=20
enhance our existing systems.

Beth

Please respond with a plan to solve these problems.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative=20
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem. =20
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our=20
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management,=20
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because=
=20
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This=20
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt=20
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the=20
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the=20
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four month=
s=20
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday=
=20
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM an=
d=20
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six=20
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by=20
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a=20
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders=20
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact o=
n=20
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolutio=
n=20
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower=
=20
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are. =
=20
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing=20
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the=20
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense=20
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to=20
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our=20
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power=20
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solutio=
n=20
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken=20
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We=20
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5=20
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful=
=20
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building=20
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for th=
e=20
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our=
=20
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense=20
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden=20
today about these problems.=20
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted=20
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Ravi,
       Please advise your users that athena will be completely unavailable=20
starting
Wednesday17May2000.  The production server is quark (12gb RAMx18procs).
quark is configured to our standard for your use.
Thanks,
