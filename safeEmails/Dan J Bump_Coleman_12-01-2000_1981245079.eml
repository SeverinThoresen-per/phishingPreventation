Dan--

I forgot one item re: Coleman.  Coleman has a few wells that will be flowing=
=20
thru a 3rd party gathering system into Fort Union.  As part of this bigger=20
deal with Coleman, we are going to add this receipt point (Exhibit C of=20
services agreement) / delivery point (Exhibit C of purchase agreement) to=20
these contracts.

The gathering services fee for this point only will be $0.145 per mcf=20
(essentially the Fort Union fee).  The marketing provisions would stay the=20
same under the gas purchase agreement.

I will get you the meter # and other details, but for now would you call it=20
the "Bear Paw / Fort Union interconnect" and reflect the $0.145 per mcf rate=
=2E

Thanks

D
