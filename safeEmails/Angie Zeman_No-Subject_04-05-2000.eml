Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlie=
r=20
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up=
=20
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any=20
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT=20
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.   =
=20
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a=
=20
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some=20
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees=20
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing,=20
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied=20
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowerin=
g=20
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their=
=20
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their=20
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process=20
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other=
=20
questions about this conversation, please let me know.=20

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.  =20

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providin=
g=20
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie =20
