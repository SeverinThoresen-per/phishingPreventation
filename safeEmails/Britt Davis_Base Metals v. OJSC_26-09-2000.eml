PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Please be advised that our attorneys have filed a motion for leave to file a=
=20
supplemental motion on behalf of MG Metals regarding Base Metals' belated=20
attempt to serve OJSC in the underlying lawsuit.  We make two arguments in=20
the underlying substantive motion supporting the legal conclusion that Base=20
Metal's attempt was invalid:  (a), the service was mailed by the plaintiffs,=
=20
rather than by the Court, the latter of which is required by the federal=20
rules of civil procedure, and (b), Base Metal failed to satisfy its burden=20
under the federal rules of showing that Russian law did not preclude service=
=20
in this manner.

We are hammering on this point because under applicable Maryland procedure, =
a=20
plaintiff such as Base Metals must serve the underlying lawsuit within 60=20
days of the attachment of a third-parties' goods.  Unfortunately, no Marylan=
d=20
legal authority has thus far addressed what happens when someone like Base=20
Metals fails to do so, but we will of course argue the common-sense=20
proposition:  that Base Metals' failure to comply with this 60-day period is=
=20
lethal to its attempt to keep the escrow account open.

I will keep you advised.

Britt
