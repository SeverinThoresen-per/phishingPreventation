Enron Bonds Subject To Market Jitters, Not Buyout Talk
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reports over the weekend that embattled Enron Corp. (=
ENE) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company's bond=
s Monday.=20
On Sunday, the Independent in London reported that Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.=
 (RD) planned to mount an $11 billion offering for the company. And Barron's=
 stated that there was speculation that Enron might attract takeover interes=
t from either Royal Dutch or Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA).
Enron's bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in re=
lation to Treasury bond issues.=20
A $74 bid and a $77 offer was quoted as the market for Enron's 7-7/8% bonds =
of 2003 Monday morning, similar to Friday's levels.=20
"The company's bonds were quoted in the low- to mid-70s on Friday and the ru=
mors have not shown up in that pricing," said Wayne Schmidt, portfolio manag=
er, Advantus Capital Management, St. Paul, Minn.=20
"Market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds,"=
 said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Ch=
icago.=20
Even an Enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par,=
 traders said.=20
The 6.45% coupon bond due on November 15, 2001, less than two weeks away, wa=
s bid at a dollar price of 99.=20
"Some investors don't want to own anything with a downside risk," said Harol=
d Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Prin=
ceton, N.J. The bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame, with lit=
tle upside potential gain, he added.=20
There is "very little liquidity in the company's bonds," said Rivkin. Enron'=
s bonds will follow the company's stock movements, he added. Enron closed Mo=
nday at $11.03, down $0.27 from Friday's close of $11.30.=20
Enron officials weren't immediately available to comment.=20
Crisis Of Investor Confidence=20

The Houston-based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor con=
fidence since it reported a $618 million third quarter loss and a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity last month.=20
And last Wednesday, the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into Enron's financi=
al dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer, =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The ratings agencies have reacted to the company's liquidity problems brough=
t about by the loss in investor confidence. Fitch downgraded Enron's senior =
unsecured debt Monday to triple-B-minus, from triple-B-plus. It's now just a=
 notch away from junk bond status.=20
Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the credit rating to triple-B, wh=
ile Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating to Baa2.=20
Shell May Have Interest, But=20

Royal Dutch Shell may have an interest in Enron, say analysts.=20
"Shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to e=
xpand in North America and Latin America," said Tina Vital, equity analyst, =
Standard & Poor's.=20
Enron is known for its trading prowess.=20
And Enron could also be attractive if it could be bought cheaply, since "She=
ll has a history of not overpaying for its acquisitions," Vital said.=20
But, "no one is going to buy the company unless it squares up its equity iss=
ues," she added.=20
The company is not perceived by the markets as having been forthcoming in it=
s financial reporting, analysts said.=20

Market Views Enron Takeover Rumors With Skepticism
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With each day shedding light on new revelations about=
 Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial dealings, it is difficult to put odds on the =
company as a takeover target.=20
But speculation has been persistent that Royal Dutch/Shell Group may use Enr=
on's weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover.
Over the weekend, the British newspaper, The Independent, fanned the flames =
of speculation again by saying that Shell was expected to offer $11 billion =
for the Houston energy trader.=20
A Shell spokesman wasn't immediately available.=20
Surely, Enron's thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a compan=
y such as the Anglo-Dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the U.S. natur=
al gas market, where Shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence.=
=20
However, a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liab=
ilities lurking in the company's financial structure. Enroll has used a web =
of off-balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and pre=
serve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs.=20
Some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off it=
s balance sheet.=20
Several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such =
as Shell would want to make an acquisition while a Securities and Exchange C=
ommission investigation is pending.=20
As for Enron's core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - =
it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is Enron's staf=
f. As a result, it would help if deal were friendly because such a transacti=
on could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile tra=
nsactions.=20
Shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing an=
d trading sector through its Coral Energy unit, and the acquisition of Enron=
 could give it instant clout in the market. Also, Shell's strong balance she=
et would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness.=20
Traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it wo=
uld be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation c=
almed and more details of Enron's business are uncovered.=20
A growth-fund manager, who requested anonymity, also said it is important to=
 know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in Enron's stock pr=
ice. He speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use =
the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock.=20
Enron shares recently traded at $11.14, down 16 cents, or 1.4%. The stock be=
gan the day in positive territory, and traded as high as $12.20 intraday.=20
The stock has declined more than 60% since the company in mid-October posted=
 a third-quarter charge of more than $1 billion. The company also later disc=
losed an additional $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity caused by=
 the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its form=
er chief financial officer Andy Fastow.=20
In the weeks that followed the disclosure, Enron's credit rating was downgra=
ded by Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch.=20

No Excuses for This Enron Board

The more I look at this board of directors at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - comme=
ntary) , the more puzzled I am. I thought that the directors would be somewh=
at typical of the "professional" board members that predominate at large com=
panies, busy people who wouldn't know a derivative if it walked into them an=
d hit them along side the head with a two-by-four.=20
It's just the opposite. Let me rip down some of these folks' bios, and you c=
an be as puzzled as I am. Let's take them alphabetically.=20
Robert Belfer ran Belco Petroleum, and comes from a sophisticated family of =
oil operatives. He should be able to spot anything that even smacked of chic=
anery in the oil business from just his old-boy ties. I know this family; th=
ey are very smart and very wise to the ways of Wall Street, Main Street and =
the oil patch.=20
Norman Blake is a gent I met years ago at USFG, before he sold it at a huge =
profit. This man has recently served as CEO of Comdisco, a leasing company t=
hat is not only comfortable with debt and financing, it is wallowing in it.=20
Blake has General Electric training. This man can smell things that are not =
so right from miles away. Where was he in all of this? Stuck in Comdisco hel=
l?=20
Ronnie Chan is a longtime kingpin in Hong Kong, a place where financial orig=
inality is always on display. Chan certainly would have understood how unsee=
mly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared. He's seen everything o=
ver in Kong.=20
John Duncan is an energy investment guy, a director of EOTT Energy, and a se=
asoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting. Again, very sophi=
sticated.=20
Wendy Gramm regulated derivatives. She was the chairman of the CFTC and a di=
rector of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. How could she not have spotted th=
is obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed? That was pa=
rt of her old job.=20
Robert Jaedicke was a professor of accounting at Stanford Business School, w=
here he was also dean. This guy wrote the book on this stuff and really shou=
ld have seen it coming.=20
(I am skipping Ken Lay, the CEO.)=20
Charles Lemaistre and John Mendelsohn, two execs from the University of Texa=
s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, can't be expected to catch this stuff, and th=
erefore gets a pass from me.=20
Paulo Ferraz Pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of th=
e State Bank of Rio de Janeiro. That's probably put him in more than his fai=
r share of difficult financial situations. How could he not raise a word abo=
ut it?=20
Frank Savage serves as chairman of Alliance Capital Management International=
, perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management. I=
 am sure Savage never saw a situation as bad as Enron's looking through his =
own company's portfolio of investments.=20
Jeffrey Skilling, the man who resigned as CEO, needs to be heard from. We kn=
ow that he is a director of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank o=
f Dallas, a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don't get hold. W=
hat did he know and when did he know it?=20
John Wakeham, Lord Wakeham to everybody, is perhaps the most financially sop=
histicated Brit to serve in Parliament. He managed a large private practice =
as a chartered accountant. He's big and powerful and smart.=20
Herbert Winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment par=
tnerships and used to serve as a director of Penn Central, a place that saw =
more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations.=20
In short, this is the most sophisticated, hands-on group of folks I have com=
e across. I can't believe they checked off on this stuff. I have to believe =
they didn't know, or if they knew of the partnerships, I believe they had no=
 idea what they were doing.=20
I want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to tak=
e down a lot of debt and not hurt Enron's credit rating with the agencies --=
 not that that's such an ethical setup. But at least it makes me think that =
the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seem=
ed unimportant, as they might not have known how big and how extended the pa=
rtnerships were.=20
Still, let's not fool ourselves. This was a powerhouse, fantastic, upright b=
oard of people who know a thing or two. I can't believe they let this stuff =
occur. I think they knew nothing.=20
Which is pretty terrible in its own right.=20



This Market Deserves Your Well-Placed Optimism

D=E9j=E0 vu circa 1991. That's what I keep thinking about. I recall that tim=
e vividly. Bank of Boston, Chase, Chemical, Citibank, they all started rally=
ing. We bears would call each other and joke about it. We would say that it =
was a ridiculous move, that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively, b=
ecause there was no way that any of these banks would make it.=20
Heck, Bank of Boston was teetering on insolvency. Citibank was technically b=
ankrupt already. The Jim Grants of the world (more powerful now than they we=
re then because he didn't have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite=
 under his belt) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common s=
tocks of the banks rallying.=20
I would call the analysts, and they wouldn't know anything either -- the one=
s who liked the banks all the way down, who still liked them and who had no =
credibility at all. The ones who hated them didn't want to get off the winni=
ng horses. They didn't know that the race was over and that a new one had be=
gun.=20
Or, to put it the brutal way that I now know was right: No one with a brain =
was long any of these.=20
Turns out, of course, that brains were one of those commodities that was wil=
dly overvalued at the bottom. What you had to do was check your skepticism a=
nd embrace optimism, because at certain points in history optimists get it r=
ight.=20
That's how I feel about this market. I think the time to be skeptical was be=
fore all of the damage occurred. I think we will look back at this period an=
d say the following: The great bear market started in March 2000 and was con=
tinuing to run rampant until Sept. 11, the crisis that triggered a massive i=
nflux of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around. Most =
of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and=
 that we were going to slide into a Japanese recession or that no turn would=
 ever come. They were wrong, just like they were in 1991.=20
We get so caught up in the "Is Cisco bottoming?" or "Is Intel breaking out?"=
 minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time =
now, pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago.=20
You would think that we'd have converted more bears to bulls by now, but lik=
e in 1991, it didn't happen until well into the turn.=20
Don't confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities. I think that, for e=
xample, XO Communications is going to fail, and when it does, there will be =
the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech. I think that McLeod is going to =
fail and we will see the same. There are a ton of companies that won't get t=
hrough this period, just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loan=
s that failed long after the turn came in 1991.=20
And I reserve the right to hate individual stocks. I can't get my arms aroun=
d how Ford comes back; I don't understand the Enron fiasco at all. I am not =
even sure that Qwest can staunch the bleeding.=20
But that doesn't make me bearish.=20
Understand that I am strictly a Pavlovian creature. Had I not lived through =
the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991, had I not pe=
rsonally been "bought in" on a half-dozen banks I was shorting and had I not=
 later on seen those banks get big bids from super-regionals not long after =
I, too, would be suspicious and want to bet against the market. I can't, tho=
ugh, because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my abi=
lity to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove =
that I don't want to get burned by again.=20
Believe me, I am a cold-blooded individual about these things. If I thought =
the short side was the right side here, I would be all over it. We have had =
a huge bounce off the bottom; there would be nothing "unpatriotic" about say=
ing "get out now."=20
But I don't think that's right. I think this market's going to keep working =
here.=20
If it doesn't, people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me, and =
I will say, c'est la vie, I took a stand; it was wrong. Taking stands, howev=
er, is what it is all about. Knowing your context and making money with that=
 context is what I do and have done for 20 years. If you don't have a contex=
t, if you don't have a view, there's only one thing to do: Give your money t=
o others who do.=20
Random musings: Glenn Curtis's Era of Value Newsletter has been making me mo=
ney. When something makes me money I talk about it. Check it out here. Curti=
s and Gary B. Smith both are doing some terrific things. Understand, I get a=
ll of the newsletters out there. I see the hype that a Navallier or a Murphy=
 puts out and I want to puke. This stuff is nothing like that, nothing at al=
l. It is honest, candid and doesn't guarantee that you will shoot the lights=
 out, like those who you know can't ... On my radio show, it's Mutual Fund M=
