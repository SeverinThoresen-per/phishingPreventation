I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you=20
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for=20
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA &=
=20
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to=20
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is=
=20
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity=
=20
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will=20
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up i=
n=20
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the ga=
s=20
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  -- =20
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how som=
e=20
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any=20
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.
