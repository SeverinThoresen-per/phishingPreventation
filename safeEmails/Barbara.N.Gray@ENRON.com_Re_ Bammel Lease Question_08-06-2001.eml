Jim, this issue is adequately covered in the lease and related documents whi=
ch were blessed by you and the storage reservoir engineers.  Why this late e=

 AEP/HPL is operating this facility contrary to safe/industry standards or r=
egulatory requirements or is otherwise endangering the facility, related fac=
ilities or the integrity thereof, please call me ASAP.   Sincerely

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters=
 to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fac=
t that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the =
facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which =
would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a cha=
llenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reamin=
g 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility wit=
h the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could =
create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casin=
gs and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to ques=
tion the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspecti=
ve if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of =
watering out the outer wells and the facility itself. =20
