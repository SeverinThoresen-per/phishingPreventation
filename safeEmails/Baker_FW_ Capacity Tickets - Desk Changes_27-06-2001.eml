Just to let you know, I have changed the following tickets from the desks yo=
u assigned in May to Central Transport. =20

 Sitara #  91742  Consumers Energy    This ticket shows it ends 6/30/01; Ple=
ase verify and I will not create a new for July. This is an internal contrac=
t - I would go ahead and create it for another year.  We use this like a poo=
ling contract.  The cost associated with this is a monthly fee that Consumer=
s charges to use their pooling services.  The desk that this should be assoc=
iated with is IM-Mkt Central Mich.
Sitara #  91743   MichCon                  This ticket shows it ended 4/30/0=
1. It is ok that this ended.  We no longer use this contract.=20
 Sitara # 134583  NGPL                       New Ticket eff July 1, 2001   8=
76271  IM_CENTRAL  GULF Storage deal has been extended through 4/30/2002=20
 Sitara # 134586  NGPL                       New Ticket eff  July 1, 2001   =
876369  IM-CENTRAL GULF Storage deal has been extended through 6/2/2002=20

If you have any questions, please call me.  Also let me know if you need any=
 assistance with setting up tickets.
