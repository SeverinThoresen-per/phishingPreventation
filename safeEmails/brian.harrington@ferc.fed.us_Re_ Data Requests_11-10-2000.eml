Yes, this question pertains to generation owned or controlled in California.=
 =20
Since Enron does not own or control any generation in California this data=20
request would not apply.

Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was
sent to us in error.  Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in
California, so these questions do not apply.  Please let me know if I have
read the question incorrectly.
