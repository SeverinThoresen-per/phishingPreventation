Per our conversation -  on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg=
=2E=20
and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central=20
desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East wil=
l=20
record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were=20
done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for eac=
h=20
of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not have the=20
appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of accounting a=
t=20
this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the=20
past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the=20
UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going to profit=20
center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant=20
changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower=20
level of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at the=20
different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing=
=20
their analysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in the=20
meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion=20
that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the=20
organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will=20
need to be able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisions wer=
e=20
made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain=20
unchanged for this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss=20
further.  Thanks!
