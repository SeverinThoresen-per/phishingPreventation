Sorry-I read part 1 of this question and talked to dgs, but didn't see part =

n the Green Mtn deal.  Is there anyone else that I should talk to? =20

Thanks,

stacey,

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandh=
ill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suff=
ice as a reason to  unwind this.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and=
 for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficient=
ly that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching=
 the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Thanks,

Doug
