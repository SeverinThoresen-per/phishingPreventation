Thanks.  I got your voice message.=20

 I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major =
formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can wal=
k away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm c=
oncerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & diffe=
rences in preferences of formatting style.
