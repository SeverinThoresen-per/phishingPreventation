Andy

This Wednesday, the 25th, I would like to get you, Mike and I together and t=
alk with Dick Ingersoll on the procedure that MISO will propose on Source Si=
nk reservation requirements.

We need to be sure what the Enron position is for purposes of the RTO settle=
ments. =20

The concern that I am hearing from Dick is that Enron should not be supporti=
ng any process which requires disclosure of ultimate source or sink until ti=
me of scheduling.  From what I understand of the solution MISO proposes, the=
re will be at least one leg with a "fixed" source and sink to be disclosed a=
t time of reservation in order for a request to be approved.  Transmission r=
edirect after approval and confirmation of this "fixed" leg could be a plaus=
ible solution - but I understand this won't be in place initially.

Dick, please let me know how to contact you on Wed and at what times.

Thank you all.
