VOM - I think we did $2, Brandon should be able to confirm, I know it was 7x=
24, with 8 hour min run
Re size - our interest is atmost 250 MW

Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For exa=
mple we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable=
 as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into=
 play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for =
ECAR.
