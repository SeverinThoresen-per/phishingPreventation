Vince and Christie,

Greetings.  I am writing because I need a break out of names for the Tiger=20
Team group 1 and 3.  I understand Tiger Team group 2 has decided not to be a=
=20
part of Enron and I also need to know who those students are.  I have a=20
listing of all the tiger team members but they are listed alphabetically so=20
that does not help me with my quest.  We are trying to firm up the details=20
and get offers out to the correct people for summer associate positions in=20
Vince's department.

Regards,

Kristin
