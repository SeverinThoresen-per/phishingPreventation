INTERVIEW: New Enron CFO On Ambitions In Forest Products
By Zahida Hafeez
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- While Enron Industrial Markets' trading of forest prod=
ucts has grown at a steady pace, Jeff McMahon, the new chief financial offic=
er of Enron Corp. (ENE), said one of the "biggest obstacles" to the unit's e=
ven better performance remains strong publisher-producer relationships.=20
In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires on Oct. 23, when he was chief execu=
tive of Enron Industrial Markets and before his appointment as Enron CFO, Mc=
Mahon said "we may end up changing that relationship" between producers and =
consumers. That may seem like a tall order in an industry which functions on=
 decades-long ties, though sometimes ties based on a love-hate relationship.
However, judging from the steady growth so far in Enron's newsprint trading =
as well as expectations for growth by the end of 2001, Enron is making headw=
ay in the physical trading of forest products.=20
The volume of newsprint Enron bought and sold jumped from less than 5,000 me=
tric tons in January to 60,000 tons in July. And by the end of the year, Enr=
on officials expect their monthly newsprint transactions volume will have do=
ubled July's levels to reach 120,000 tons.=20
However, even with such expectations for growth in the monthly transactions =
volume, becoming a major player in the forest products industry may take a w=
hile for Enron to achieve.=20
Enron's projected volumes for newsprint sales and purchases form a small por=
tion of the total annual sales estimated at roughly 15 million tons for the =
North American region.=20
"In three years, will we look like an Abitibi? No, that's not our goal," sai=
d McMahon, referring to Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. (ABY), the world's largest=
 newsprint-maker. "Our goal is to be (one of) the largest marketers of newsp=
rint in North America...to fundamentally change the way newsprint is bought =
and sold in North America, in giving consumers and producers additional ways=
 to manage their risks," he said.=20
The way the forest products industry currently manages price fluctuations - =
undesirable from both the producer and publisher standpoint - hasn't worked,=
 whether it's through producers asking customers to trust them or through su=
pply management, McMahon argued.=20
Referring to a graph of price fluctuations superimposed on inventory levels,=
 McMahon said, "I wonder if inventory levels are a leader or follower of pri=
ce change? It's the which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question."=20
"(The price volatility) has been around for 100 years, why will it be fixed =
in 2002?" he asked.=20
The best way to diminish price gyrations, McMahon said, is to lock in long-t=
erm prices through Enron's financial hedging tools. Even the company's physi=
cal trading end ultimately serves to promote a market for its hedging produc=
ts.=20

Other Hurdles In Growing Newsprint Trading Volumes=20

For now, McMahon concedes that Enron Industrial Market's forest products ope=
rations have to overcome some hurdles. One other major hindrance has been th=
e fact that Enron's message has been a hard sell to production managers at p=
rinting presses.=20
Some purchasing managers and production managers at U.S. publishers argue th=
at their printing presses are very sensitive to the quality of newsprint and=
 fear that Enron's newsprint may not be up to the mark.=20
Such thinking is misguided, Enron officials counter, because a majority of p=
ublishers across the country use printing presses made by the same maker, an=
d yet, those who have tried Enron's newsprint are happy with its quality.=20
In any case, when more production managers start to get convinced of Enron's=
 ability to provide product that will satisfy their printing presses' specif=
ications, "That's where the evolution starts to happen," said McMahon.=20
Another way McMahon believes his company can accomplish its goals is to crea=
te a pricing benchmark.=20
Though the various qualities and grades of newsprint will still exist, "phys=
ical newsprint can price off that benchmark once that (standard) is achieved=
," he explained.=20

Former CFO Imbroglio Doesn't Affect Forest Pdts Arm=20

McMahon replaced Andrew Fastow as CFO last week amid an informal investigati=
on by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the company's finances as =
well as talk of losses stemming from partnerships managed by Fastow and the =
subsequent plunge in Enron's stock price.=20
The energy giant said Monday it was lobbying banks for a new credit line as =
Enron struggles to bounce back from a disappointing third-quarter and the Fa=
stow-related transactions.=20
Although McMahon was unavailable for an updated comment, Karen Denne, vice p=
resident of communications, said Enron Industrial Markets venture in forest =
products will stay on the same course without any pullback in capital despit=
e the company's current struggles.=20
Enron began its physical trading of newsprint and other forest products more=
 than a year ago, while it has been offering financial hedging tools in the =
sector for the past five years.=20

Enron Shares Fall a Day After Moody's Lowers Rating (Update1)
2001-10-30 13:19 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall a Day After Moody's Lowers Rating (Update1)

     (Updates with comment from AEP, Exelon and Northeast
Utilities on trading business starting in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares fell as
much as 20 percent a day after Moody's Investors Service placed
the largest energy trader's rating for commercial paper on review
for downgrade and lowered its long-term debt to two notches above
junk status.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.60, or 19 percent, to $11.21 in early
afternoon trading. Earlier, they touched $11, the lowest price
since January 1993. The stock, down for the 10th day in a row, had
dropped 83 percent this year.

     Moody's lowered Enron's long-term credit rating to ``Baa2''
from ``Baa1'' yesterday. It also placed the company's ``P-2''
rating for commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     ``I think investors would have loved to have no downgrade or
a more stable outlook for the company,'' Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade said. ``Moody's left some uncertainty.''
     Meade doesn't own Enron shares and rates the company
``accumulate.''

     Executives from Exelon Corp., American Electric Power Co. and
Northeast Utilities said they still are trading with Enron.

                        `Watching Closely'

     ``Nervous is probably not the right word, but we are watching
very closely,'' AEP Chief Executive Officer Linn Draper said at an
energy conference in New Orleans. ``We are focusing our new deals
with them in the short term, November and December,''

     Columbus, Ohio-based AEP is the biggest U.S. electricity
generator. Traders often buy and sell power for delivery the next
day or for over a week, month, quarter or calendar year. The
Bloomberg Energy Service is quoting power prices for as far ahead
as September 2003.

     ``We are keeping a close eye on our exposure,'' Exelon Corp.
Co-Chief Executive Officer John Rowe said at the conference. ``We
are keeping a tight dollar limit on trades.'' He declined to
provide specifics.

     Chicago-based Exelon is the biggest U.S. nuclear-power
producer.

     ``Three weeks ago, we started monitoring our position with
Enron,'' Northeast Chief Financial Officer John Forsgren said at
the conference. ``Right now, we have a net payable to them, so
there's no exposure on our side, and we'll probably keep it that
way.''

     Northeast, based in Berlin, Connecticut, will continue to
trade with Enron as long as its debt ratings remain investment
grade, Forsgren said. Northeast is New England's biggest utility
owner.

                            SEC Inquiry

     The Wall Street Journal reported that a U.S. Security and
Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with
affiliates, run by the company's former chief financial officer
Andrew Fastow, has moved to Washington, signaling the
investigation has become more serious.

      Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from the affiliates, which were formed to buy and sell
Enron assets. Houston-based Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday amid
the SEC inquiry into the partnerships he ran that cost the company
at least $35 million.

     Other energy stocks also fell today as the price of natural
gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped as much as 3.7
percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index as much as 2.3 percent as
consumer confidence in the U.S. economy dropped in October to the
lowest level in more than 7 1/2 years.

     Shares of Duke Energy Corp. fell $1.33 to $37.81. Dynegy Inc.
dropped $2.23, or 5.7 percent, to $36.70. El Paso Corp. fell
$1.44, or 2.8 percent, to $49.30. Exxon Mobil Corp. fell $1.15 to
$39.53.

Enron Bond Default Insurance Doubles on Credit Woes (Update1)

Enron Bond Default Insurance Doubles on Credit Woes (Update1)

     (Adds background on asset write-offs in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Insurance premiums have
doubled for Enron Corp. bondholders as investors seek protection
amid questions about whether Enron will pay its debts and keep its
investment-grade credit rating.

     A contract to protect against a default for the next 18
months has increased to an annual fee of between 13.5 and 16.5
percent of face value, up from 6.5 to 7.5 percent a week earlier,
according to CreditSights Inc.

     Enron shares fell as much as $2.74, or 20 percent, to $11.07.
The stock has lost 65 percent of its value since Oct. 17. Enron's
6.4 percent coupon bonds due in 2006 were bid at 74 cents on the
dollar, traders said, down as much as 6 cents from yesterday's
price of 80 cents. The debt now yields 14.1 percent, up from 12.1
percent yesterday and 10.8 percent on Friday.

     Banks are ``scrambling to hedge their exposure in the credit
protection market,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at
CreditSights.

     John Tompkins, a trader at CreditTrade, a credit derivatives
brokerage, said there's interest among buyers, though not sellers
of Enron default swaps. He said there are bids for Enron credit
default swaps at 7 to 8 percent annually for five years'
protection and 12 percent annually on the three years' contract --
with no offers.

     ``Enron is atrocious today,'' he said.

                            Undisclosed

     The largest energy trader's troubles began two weeks ago when
it reported $1.01 billion in losses, including more than $544
million written off on a competitive energy supplier business and
a bandwidth trading business. Enron formed at least 18 affiliated
companies to buy and sell company assets, according to records
from the Texas secretary of state. Some of those affiliates
profited from buying or selling assets to Enron.

     The Houston-based company losses included $35 million from
partnerships set up by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
Fastow was later fired and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked for information about the transactions.

     The disclosure has set off concern among investors about how
little is known about Enron's balance sheet and caused ratings
companies to examine the company.

     ``Investors are nervous about this name,'' said Freda Lam, a
credit strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in New York.

                        Investor Relations

     Enron's long-term debt rating was cut yesterday to ``Baa2,''
two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' Moody's also placed the
Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper --
borrowing for nine-months or less -- on review for downgrade.
Enron has been shut off from the commercial paper market since the
ratings agencies began the review.

     The lack of access to money markets makes it more difficult
for Enron to borrow the short-term cash needed to run its trading
businesses. Ahead of a potential cut, Enron took out bank lines to
repay $2 billion in commercial paper last week.

     Still, most of Wall Street expects Enron's bonds to be paid
and its stock price to bounce back.

     ``We suspect that Enron's share price will not likely recover
in the near term,'' Lam said. ``We ultimately expect this company
to be successful. But it needs to improve its investor relations
and its disclosure.''

Fragile consumer sentiment added just one more layer of apprehension to Wall=

"The very weak consumer confidence numbers threw fuel on the fire, the marke=

How are Enron`s woes affecting the natural gas market? Joining us now is Rob=

back to the program.
J. ROBERT COLLINS, PRESIDENT, NYMEX: Thank you.=20
HAFFENREFFER: Certainly Enron is very much involved in the trading of natura=

els, the of high levels, of certainty surrounding this companies current pro=
blems affected that?=20
COLLINS: Well, any time that a company goes through a short term period of t=
roubles, the industry surrounding that, that has an intricate layer of credi=
t relationships, is concerned about their ability to be paid.=20
HAFFENREFFER: But for people who don`t know what Enron does, what role do th=
ey play in the trading of natural gas futures?=20
COLLINS: Well, they are a major counter-party in the natural gas industry in=
 trading, selling and distributing natural gas. And so, they have an extensi=
ve network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company i=
n the North American industry.=20
HAFFENREFFER: Are they involved, in some way, with almost every trade having=
 to do with natural gas? Are they that big?=20
COLLINS: No. I wouldn`t say that they`re involved with every trade. They`re =
involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market =
making system. But, no, they`re only a component of the market, and only do,=
 perhaps, a percentage of what trades on the NYMEX.=20
HAFFENREFFER: So when trading takes place, and it`s very fast, there`s a lot=
 of money changing hands all the time. There`s a lot of credit given to peop=
le trading and when a company like Enron has got some liquidity problems, or=
 just even fears of liquidity problems, that can affect people who do trades=
 with them.=20
COLLINS: Yes. Absolutely. It can cause people to retract from trading. It ca=
n cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading. It`s not unlike the fina=
ncial markets at all. When you have a serious credit concern.=20
HAFFENREFFER: As result, the NYMEX is working at a faster clip to get a clea=
ring service set up. Is that right? And explain what role will that have in =
easing people`s fears.=20
COLLINS: Well, last night, the board approved offering a new service called =
over-the-counter clearing. We`re extending it initially on our primary natur=
al gas contract, the Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures. What that does is allow =
counter-parties that perhaps may question each other`s credit worthiness to =
place the trade on the exchange clearing mechanism. That`s a network of 50 f=
inancial institutions and has AA credit standard.=20
HAFFENREFFER: Real quick. It`s been about a month and a half since September=
 11th.=20
COLLINS: Yes.=20
HAFFENREFFER: Are things back to normal?=20
COLLINS: I wouldn`t say that they`re back to normal. Although every day gets=
 a little better.=20
HAFFENREFFER: All right. Good to see you.=20
COLLINS: Thank you.=20
HAFFENREFFER: Bob Collins, NYMEX president.=20

Waiting for Enron's Bottom

You want to know when you can buy Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) ? It =
will have nothing to do with the fundamentals. I'm pretty sure that the inve=
stment banks will do whatever is necessary to keep this oil and gas version =
of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that blew up, in business, i=
f only because it was everybody's best client.=20
These days, though, when concentration of holdings among mutual funds is sti=
ll the rage, as idiotic as it is, all you need to know about Enron's bottomi=
ng is when Janus is done selling it. Janus' aggressive buying -- the fund ow=
ned 50 million shares of this thing not long ago, which is a staggering conc=
entration -- moved the stock up to begin with.=20
My sources indicate that Janus has been dumping the stock. I don't think you=
 can possibly make a decision whether to buy it without knowing when Janus i=
s done. That's the key material fact, not whether Enron gets the credit line=
=2E=20
The game wasn't always like this. Other than Ken Heebner in the '80s, most m=
utual fund managers didn't try to be bigger than the market. They didn't try=
 to move up stocks by buying. And they certainly didn't wreck stocks on the =
go out.=20
Ah, but the years 2000 and 2001 have brought about a different paradigm. Whe=
n these mutual funds dump, they dump terribly and really damage the stock, w=
hich then damages the company, which then damages the company's credit, whic=
h then further damages the stock again. It is a really vicious circle that s=
tarts with the selling by the funds that created the darling.=20
I wouldn't touch this stock unless I knew that Janus was done selling. Of co=
urse, that will be a big secret, because Janus sure isn't going to tell you,=
 and the broker isn't going to tell you. I have had brokers on the sly tell =
me when these folks have finished, but I fear that Janus will finish with on=
e broker then just go to another, as that is also their "style" of trading. =
I put quote marks on style because the reality is that a "style" would mean =
they know how to trade out of a big position, and these folks really don't.=20
Of course, what they should have done is gotten a bid for 50 million shares =
down two or three points rather than play this drib and drab game. But they =
never did learn to sell at that shop, which is another reason why you can't =
do business with them now that the market is no longer straight-up.=20
So there really will be no way of knowing until you see the volume of this s=
tock rise and the stock itself start going up. For those of you who believe =
Enron will make it, it's best to miss the first two points just to be sure J=
anus is done. I will keep my eyes out for you, too.=20
We'll spot the bottom, if there is one, together.=20
Random musings: Think you are a good trader? Think you can trade with the bi=
g boys? Think you want to be able to catch on with a hedge fund? Want to pic=
k up five G's in the interim? OK, then, enter our trading contest. That's ri=
ght, we have a contest where there's real money on the line once you have en=
tered it, real prize money. This could be the test, the verified test, you n=
eed to show guys like Berko, my old partner, that you know how to trade to m=
ake money. I can't tell you how valuable that validation can be for your car=
eer.=20
And you get paid to boot!=20
Sign up here for the contest. I do hope you join.=20


GERMANY: German watchdog may sue firms over power charges.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office said on Tuesday it wou=
ld take legal action against four utilities if they did not change the way t=
hey charge competitors for power used to keep the grid in balance.=20
"We have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will =
change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors=
," cartel office spokesman Stefan Siebert told Reuters.
"If they don't do that, then ultimately we could issue an injunction to forc=
e them to do so."=20
The competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received compla=
ints that grid operators Bewag (BKLG.DE, EnBW , HEW and Veag that the four f=
irms "charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs" for=
 balancing energy.=20
German grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such p=
ower in their grid areas, which they control by temporarily switching on and=
 off their power plants. This poses a potential threat to other power suppli=
ers.=20
"New entrants to the German market, such as London's Enron Capital & Resourc=
es and Hamburg's LichtBlick, because of their small customer portfolios, can=
not balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy=
 groups can," the statement said.=20
"Consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy (and) are threat=
ened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it."=20
The four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balan=
cing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country's association agreement=
 (VV2), which is due to be modified by next year.=20
"Illegal cartel conduct cannot be justified through the association agreemen=
t," said cartel office president Ulf Boege in the statement.=20
"References to the agreement show rather that there is an urgent need for ac=
tion in VV 2, which is currently being modified, to develop regulations on t=
he accounting of balancing energy that conform with cartel law," he added.=20
Utilities RWE and E.ON have introduced an auction system for their balancing=
 energy needs to provide a market to other potential generators, as a condit=
ion of their respective mergers last year.=20
RWE Net's Regulating Power Manager Klaus Albers said last week that the syst=
em it introduced in April, which is based on a cartel office model, had not =
so far produced the lower prices it was designed to.=20
He said he expected all grid operators to introduce a market for their balan=
cing energy needs within two years.
