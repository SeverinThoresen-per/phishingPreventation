Is it Steve's call to eliminate new sales stations when Entex is ECT's=20

m=20
running any economics on Pheasant Creek City Gate station.

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several=20
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since=
=20
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please=20
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for=
=20
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which w=
e=20
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be=20
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's=20
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?
