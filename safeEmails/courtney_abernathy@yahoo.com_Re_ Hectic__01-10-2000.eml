Boy did I flake on the happy hour.  Jeff-I think I've
gone over THE edge.  Hectic does't even work anymore.
I'm on a (fairly)good project at HP..IN SACRAMENTO,
in fact 20 miles north of Sacramento. I LOVE the
company, the learning, the work, the teams, the
people, the career opportunities.  I hate the 4+ hours
of driving on Mondays and Tuesdays, strategizing(real
word?) about balancing the needs of the team with
getting my ass to school. I really want to talk to
you...I'm thinking about full time and want your
thoughts.  Are you available at break on Tuesday for a
beer?
