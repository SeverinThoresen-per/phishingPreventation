	I do not think this is a conflict issue as to Enron and your representation=
 of Enron as you are not being engaged by Malme.  I do not see a problem. Mi=
chelle do you agree?=20

However, we thank you for bring it to our attention.

Michelle and Kriste:

Of all bizarre twists.  Please see message below.  Malme has purchased an
employment practices liability insurance policy (EPLI) and we are scheduled
to do the audit required by the insurance company.  While Texas conflicts
law probably would not make this a conflict because it is not like or
related to other work we have done for Enron, California conflict laws
apparently are more strict.  Could you confirm that Enron does not have a
problem with us doing an employment law audit for Malme's current company. =20
