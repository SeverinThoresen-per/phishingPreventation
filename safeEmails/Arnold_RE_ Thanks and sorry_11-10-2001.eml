I appreciate your allowing us to use your enclosed office for Ken Lay video =
applications.  In testing the equipment today, I realized for the first time=
 that our fiber feed involved that big black box that you've undoubtedly not=
iced.  I was unaware that that would be necessary.  We really view this as t=
emporary because we are planning to move all video activity to the new build=
ing before the end of the year.  However, if you would prefer, I can request=
 to have the box moved out and a fixture put in your wall.=20

Thanks again, John.

Vance Meyer
