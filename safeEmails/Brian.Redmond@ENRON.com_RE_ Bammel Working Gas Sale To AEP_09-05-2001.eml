Thanks Jim S.

I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them thi=
s week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update the=
m of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our tradin=
g position.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June b=
id week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.

Brian

Subject:	Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  =
Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will =
average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in ano=
ther 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that =
AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Account=
ing should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001? =
 Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anyth=
ing that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to=
 facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!=
  Please let me know your thoughts.
