Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group relate=
d=20
to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's goin=
g=20
a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the=20
majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading=20
arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda=20
rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the=20
week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay=20
balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split=20
into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus,=
=20
with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business. =20
It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things=20
to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The=20
kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him t=
o=20
turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that wa=
s=20
too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slide=
s=20
down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow=20
bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off=20
or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the=20
way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets=20
right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe=20
you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next=20
couple of days.

Did you survive bid week?
?
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for=20
you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff=20
left?
?
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
?
Gotta run. Almost have my *&^%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a=20
personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big=20
changes. It sucks.
?
Later,
Ken
