The only FT-Central-Opt book that should move to her is the GDL.  The others=
 should remain with Geoff Storey.  She also needs to have the INTRA-CNT-TRAN=
S-PHY book.  Sorry for the mistake.

Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the cent=
ral desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The f=
ollowing books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say =
she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.=
  Thanks.
