Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL=
=20
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for=20
HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream. =20
The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relate=
s=20
to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made=20
pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 =
a=20
day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a=20
reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream=20
represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not=20
indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL=20
or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been=20
allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility=
=20
for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from=20
the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written=20
correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it=20
did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That=20
contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation=20
evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have bee=
n=20
sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy=20
of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under th=
e=20
Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's=20
agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved=20
through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum=
=20
of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such su=
m=20
in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the=20
event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to=20
remit such amount together with interest to Upstream.
