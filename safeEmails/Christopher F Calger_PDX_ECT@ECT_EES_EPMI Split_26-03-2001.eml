Just to add to Tim's note - I suggest that the number of overlap issues woul=
d be few and far between and can be resolved at the operating level.  I thin=
k ENA can offer up representatives from each region that have an open line o=
f communication with the appropriate EES people.  If ENA and EES provided ea=
ch other with a short list of contacts there should be no need to deal with =
this at the OTC level.  For example, Chris Foster (ENA West Power Mid Market=
) would direct  questions/opportunities to EES and field calls from EES peop=
le looking at deals in the western power market.

ENA Interface List:

Power:
West:  Foster
Midwest: Baughman
East: Pagan
Texas: Sukaly

Gas:
West: Tycholiz
Midwest: Luce
East: Vickers
Texas: Martin

Dave knows all of these people and I believe that they do things in the best=
 interest of "One-Enron".

Regards,

Chris =20

i heard dave's voicemail.  i appreciate his concern.  however, i don't think=
 that the delineation is easy to do.  i am confident that my team knows what=
 we are good at and what we aren't good at.  if we aren't best suited to ser=
ve the load, we will act like "one enron" and send the account over to the t=
hem.  the split should really be driven by the customer's needs and which ut=
ility they are behind.  for example, montana power has a wonderful balancing=
 tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to t=
he actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances.  we=
 don't do any metering, we don't do any unique billing, the loads range anyw=
here from 1 MW to 25 MW.  ena is definitely best suited to serve these indus=
trials because commodity price is their top interest.  the pugest system is =
about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana's.  ena will be=
 very well positioned to serve this load.  the same company could have a pla=
nt in california.  we wouldn't serve that load because the expertise needed =
to manage the ctc risk (before this thing blew up anyway), the challenge of =
metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs. actual basis, and th=
e load forecasting.  the same company could also own gas stations in the wes=
t.  we have no interest in serving gas stations.

i also heard the message attached to dave's from scott dann (sp?).  his mess=
age did little to open communication between groups.  he provided no details=
 on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi (ena) and ees.  for =
us to do this right, ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without i=
nvolving the office of the chair of each company.  i would be happy to work =
with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts.

i still can't think of a clean way to divide customers.  each approach has i=
ts problems.  each company (ees and ena) has its strengths.  our strength is=
 commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid.  the=
ir strength is in tariff analysis, energy management, and aggregating loads.

for the west, i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disput=
es with ees that are reasonable.  we know what we are good at.  we have a pr=
oven track record with a large number of industrials in the west.  i still b=
elieve that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored =
approach.  it will require better communication on the operating level betwe=
en ees and ena.
