The Chautaqua Airlines master agreement has a confidentiality clause in it=20
that precludes us from showing the agreement to third parties.  The clause=20
does allow the parties to show it to their "affiliates" who are required to=20
keep the information confidential.  In this case if Wexford is an "affiliate=
"=20
of Chautaqua Airlines then Chautaqua can give Wexford a copy of the=20
agreement.  An "affiliate" would be an entity that would be contolling or=20
under common control or controlled by the other entity.=20

The only way for us to deliver the agreement to Wexford is if we received a=20
waiver from Chautaqua allowing us to give a copy of the agreement to=20
Wexford.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
