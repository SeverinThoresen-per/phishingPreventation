Subject:	Transfers from EES

Attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transf=
ers out of EES.  These transfers will be effective July 1, 2001 and I need t=
o get this to HR by Friday, June 1, 2001 to give them time to get everything=
 effected.

I think I have incorporated all your comments, but please review one more ti=
me and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn't have or excluded a=
nyone.  You'll note that at this point we are not forming East and West risk=
 management cost centers.  Don and Rogers have decided for cost management p=
urposes to leave it consolidated at this point.

Once you have signed off on your groupings, Rachel Massey in Corporate Plann=
ing will be working with each of you to forecast your Q3 and Q4 cost center =
expense plans.

Please let me know ASAP of any changes and don't hesitate to call with quest=
ions.

Thanks

Wade
