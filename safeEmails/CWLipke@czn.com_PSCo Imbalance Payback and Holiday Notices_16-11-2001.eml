IMBALANCE PAYBACK GAS AND/OR OVER-DELIVERY RESTRICTION UPDATE=20


Due to continuing warm weather and operational issues, PSCo's restriction on=
 imbalance payback gas and/or over-deliveries into the system will remain in=
 affect until further notice.  In order to avoid the need for upcoming weekd=
ay and/or weekend OBP's, it is critical that Shippers, Nominating Agents and=
 Plant Operators do not schedule imbalance payback gas or deliver more than =
confirmed nominations during this period.

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY dur=
ing this restricted period.  If over-deliveries become a problem, PSCo will =
activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback gas to =
PSCo for the duration of the restriction.  Any imbalance gas remaining on th=
e system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance f=
or your cooperation.


Sincerely,=20
