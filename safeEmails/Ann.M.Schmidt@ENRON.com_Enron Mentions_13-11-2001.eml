Dynegy and Enron Shares Get a Boost As Acquisition Plan is Met With Optimism

The shares of Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. both rose in heavy trading as inve=
stors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of Dynegy's plan=
 to acquire Enron in a stock swap with a current value of $10.12 billion.=20
In calls and meetings with analysts yesterday, Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson =
and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay continued talking up the deal that was announ=
ced late Friday. "We are confident this is good strategically and financiall=
y for Dynegy and Enron," said Mr. Watson, who will serve as chairman and chi=
ef executive of the combined entity, to be called Dynegy Inc.
While the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies=
 and gives Dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal, investors' init=
ial reaction to the merger announcement was positive. As of 4 p.m. in New Yo=
rk Stock Exchange composite trading, Dynegy shares were at $44.31, up $5.55,=
 or 14%. Also on the Big Board, Enron was at $9.24, up 7.1%, or 61 cents. Bo=
th companies were among the most actively traded issues.=20
Under terms of the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would give 0.2685 of its sha=
res for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy's stock price yesterday , this for=
mula values Enron stock at $11.90 each. Enron has about 850 million shares o=
utstanding.=20
Some people raised cautionary notes yesterday. Moody's Investors Service pla=
ced Dynegy on review for a possible credit-ratings downgrade. Standard & Poo=
r's made a similar move on Friday. Moody's said that while it saw positive e=
lements to the proposed combination, it also believed "the financial and bus=
iness risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's=
 credit fundamentals."=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale, who counts herself a fan of Dyneg=
y, also worries that Enron's enormous problems could be a drag on the combin=
ed entity. "I don't want the Dynegy folks to get into something that's not g=
ood for the company," she said.=20
As reported, Enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and st=
anding in the investment community plummet, largely as the result of large-s=
cale transactions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers. Those t=
ransactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write-offs and =
restatements in the past month. They are being investigated by the Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholde=
r lawsuits.

Gas Pipeline Is Prominent As Dynegy Seeks Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/13/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Dynegy has negotiated a great takeover. And it may end up buying Enron, too.=
=20
As part of its planned acquisition of Enron, Dynegy will get the crown jewel=
 even if the overall deal falls apart. In return for its $1.5 billion invest=
ment today, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline=
 system that is probably worth more.
As Dynegy stock soared 14 percent yesterday, Enron's lagged behind, rising j=
ust 7 percent. [Page C13.]=20
That widened the spread -- the profit a trader could lock in by buying Enron=
 and selling Dynegy short, assuming the deal goes through -- to 28 percent.=20
The big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not=
 close for many months. It is at least a possibility that Dynegy will renego=
tiate the price, or even walk away, as it learns more about Enron's business=
=2E=20
Not that Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy, was threateni=
ng to do any such thing. In a talk to analysts yesterday, and in a later int=
erview, he was extraordinarily upbeat about Enron's trading business even as=
 he dismissed many of the company's diversifications as failures whose poor =
performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting.=20
Full details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until =
the merger agreement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to=
day or tomorrow. But it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any re=
ason, Dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any addit=
ional cash.=20
Speaking to analysts yesterday, Rob Doty, chief financial officer at Dynegy,=
 said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the=
 pipeline business.=20
Walking away from the deal might cost Dynegy $350 million if it could not ci=
te any material adverse change in Enron's business, as provided in the merge=
r agreement. But one way to look at this deal is that Dynegy is spending $1.=
85 billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of Enron on the agre=
ed terms.=20
Mr. Watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong.=20
''We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop,'' he said. ''If there i=
s no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction.''=20
In presentations to analysts, Dynegy officials said they expected the compan=
y's earnings per share to grow by at least 90 cents a year even before consi=
dering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged. That arithmetic was=
 based on assumptions that Enron could deliver at least 75 percent of the $2=
 a share in pro-forma earnings that Wall Street had been forecasting for nex=
t year. Those forecasts had stayed the same even as Enron's business collaps=
ed.=20
The bullish case for the merger is that Enron's real profits were there and =
that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems.=20
Mr. Watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnersh=
ips that were created by Enron and traded with it, providing a substantial p=
art of the company's profits in 2000.=20
Enron's need to make a deal quickly -- almost any deal -- was emphasized by =
Standard & Poor's, the bond rating service. In a conference call yesterday, =
Ron Barone, an analyst with S.& P., said that without the takeover, Enron's =
rating would have been cut to low BB or high B. Those ratings are not even a=
t the high end of junk, and a company like Enron, which depends on others be=
ing willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner, needs an investment gr=
ade rating. Its current S.& P. rating is BBB minus, the lowest investment gr=
ade rating.=20
That means Enron could not continue as an independent business. And it means=
 that should Dynegy decide to renegotiate, Enron would be in a very poor bar=
gaining position unless it had another bidder.

Suitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.
By ALEX BERENSON

11/13/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Wall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy's $9 billion takeover of t=
he Enron Corporation yesterday.=20
Three days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Ho=
uston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executiv=
es came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase=
 their company's profits. They met a receptive audience.
Dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since la=
st Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy's stock has r=
isen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent=
=2E=20
After some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have =
accepted Dynegy's view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in t=
rading natural gas and electricity. Enron's stock fell almost 80 percent in =
the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earning=
s by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives.=20
But Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday tha=
t Enron's problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He larg=
ely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron mig=
ht be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations.=20
''There's nothing wrong with Enron's business,'' Mr. Watson said in an inter=
view at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to a=
nalysts and investors. ''The people in it ought to be really upset that for =
the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been =
invested in other businesses that are not making money.''=20
Enron's immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have cause=
d other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion c=
ash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron's business p=
artners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bo=
lster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an add=
itional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential inves=
tments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wa=
ll Street Journal.=20
Mr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees wh=
o are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, and other top executives =
sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron=
's shares plunged. ''Right now, there's some animosity over there,'' he said=
=2E=20
Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquis=
ition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close =
by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from f=
ederal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice.=20
Mr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy's earnings by 90 cents =
or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share.=20
Analysts backed that view yesterday. ''Investments in noncore business distr=
acted the attention of management and also took up capital,'' said Thomas Ha=
mlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dy=
negy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue la=
st year, for a bargain price.=20
''It's not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and d=
ouble your earnings in the meantime,'' he said. ''My guess is the stock is w=
orth $70 per share.''=20
The deal could increase Dynegy's earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, sai=
d Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group.=20
''That's a whopper,'' he said. ''It's a very good deal financially, certainl=
y should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-s=
heet backstop for Enron.''=20
Mr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself becau=
se of ''the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.''=20
''We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,'' he sai=
d. ''A good company was being badly tarnished.''

Share boost for Dynegy good news=20
Saving Enron trading called key handicap=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG and DAVID IVANOVICH=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Although investors Monday cheered Dynegy's planned acquisition of Enron Corp=
=2E, Dynegy must still negotiate a series of potential roadblocks to pull of=
f a successful merger.=20
Among them: ensuring that Enron's core energy-trading business, suffering be=
fore the merger announcement, stays healthy. Negative news on that front qui=
ckly surfaced Monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely =
limited business with Enron.=20
Dynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about Enron's financial p=
erformance and investment partnerships, convince Enron's traders and other k=
ey employees to stick around, and mesh different corporate cultures.=20
Investors were optimistic in Dynegy's abilities as shares in the company tra=
ded up $5.55 to close at $44.31 Monday, while shares in Enron ended the day =
up 61 cents at $9.24.=20
Enron has been under siege since Oct. 16 when it reported a $35 million loss=
 and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings =
with investment partnerships run by its then-chief financial officer.=20
Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation =
of Enron, a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and Enron's stock price =
plummeted.=20
A new shareholder suit filed Monday included Dynegy on its list of defendant=
s.=20
Last week, Enron said it was restating its earnings back to 1997 to include =
losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several being =
investigated by the SEC. It said it was correcting almost $600 million worth=
 of mistakes.=20
Just how close Enron was to a collapse remains unclear. One industry source =
believes Enron had been pushed "to the brink" and would have been done for i=
f it had been unable to reach agreement with Dynegy last week.=20
But Ron Barone, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor's, doesn't think Enron=
's condition was so desperate.=20
"We clearly didn't see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default, b=
ut it is something that could have eroded over time ... in a fairly short ti=
me."=20
Friday, Enron's long-term debt rating was downgraded to one notch above inve=
stment-grade status by both Moody's Investors Service and S&P.=20
Enron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation, accou=
nting for about 25 percent of all transactions. Its collapse would have mean=
t the loss of much liquidity in the trading market, making trades more diffi=
cult and prices more volatile, industry experts said.=20
Dynegy announced a deal Friday to buy Enron at a fire-sale price of almost $=
9 billion in stock, plus the assumption of about $13 billion in debt and $2 =
billion in preferred stock. The merger is expected to close, barring holdups=
 from regulators, in six to nine months.=20
As part of the agreement, Dynegy stakeholder ChevronTexaco is giving Dynegy =
$1.5 billion, which is to be infused today to help shore up Enron's liquidit=
y and preserve its trading franchise.=20
Some of Enron's former trading partners are still steering clear of the gian=
t.=20
To facilitate transactions, the various energy trading firms extend credit t=
o one another. Those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an=
 adequate rating.=20
If the credit rating firms had downgraded Enron's debt to junk status, its t=
rading operation would have been devastated, industry officials said.=20
As details of Enron's questionable financial dealings have been revealed, En=
ron's trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure.=20
Kansas City, Mo.-based Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., for instance, has been=
 ratcheting down its activity with Enron, company spokesman Al Butkus said.=20
By the end of last week, Aquila's exposure to Enron was "insignificant," But=
kus said. "And after all that was revealed on Friday and the downgrading of =
the credit, we are now at an even lower level."=20
Atlanta-based Mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a l=
imited amount of business with Enron.=20
Some larger players, however, continue doing deals with the company.=20
"Reliant Energy has consistently been trading with Enron through its difficu=
lties, albeit with a heightened sense of caution," said Shahid Malik, presid=
ent of Houston-based Reliant Energy's trading operation.=20
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy's exposure stands at $100 million.=20
"We're continuing the way we have been," said Duke spokesman Terry Francisco=
=2E=20
John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, predicted it w=
ould take the traders some time to digest the merger deal.=20
"I think people will increasingly come back to Enron just as soon as the $1.=
5 billion changes hands," he said.=20
Traders still have incentives to do business with Enron even though it's bei=
ng sold, as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors =
and its EnronOnline Internet trading operation is regarded as superior.=20
On a conference call with investors and analysts Monday morning, Dynegy and =
Enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused=
 comment on a Wall Street Journal report that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Ci=
tigroup are considering a $500 million investment in Enron.=20
Analysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about E=
nron's finances, including those that could call into question whether its c=
ore trading business is as advertised.=20
Dynegy executives aren't expecting any such disclosures, but took a conserva=
tive approach to calculating merger benefits.=20
"I believe we have adequately bracketed the downside," said Chuck Watson, Dy=
negy's chairman and chief executive.=20
Even with a worst-case scenario, Dynegy still found a "tremendous amount of =
economic value" in the merger, said Watson, who will take the same roles aft=
er the merger.=20
The deal, Dynegy said, will add 90 cents to 95 cents per share in earnings f=
or current Dynegy shareholders. And that's before cost savings that are expe=
cted to run $400 million to $500 million a year.=20
Dynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal. For one, if the amoun=
t of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than $3.5 bi=
llion, it can be called off.=20
Enron and Dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep =
their key people. But will traders jump ship? "Oh, yeah I'm sure they will,"=
 the industry source said.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, believ=
es that a number of Enron's marketers and traders will find Dynegy a strong =
alternative.=20
"I firmly believe that the Enron guys like to play on the winning team and D=
ynegy is a very, very strong player," he said.=20
That Dynegy was approached by three key Enron executives about a merger show=
ed Dynegy would be getting the full cooperation of Enron's management team, =
Watson said.=20
Enron employees working for Dynegy will have to get used to a new culture. T=
eamwork and fraternal are words often used to describe Dynegy, while cutthro=
at is used for Enron, which also is known for its willingness to take more r=
isk.=20
Watson plans to blend strategies and business elements of each.=20
The new company will include Enron's strong offering of financial products a=
nd combine them with Dynegy's base of power plants and other assets, said St=
eve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, who will take the same job in the new com=
pany.=20
The post-merger Dynegy will also be more involved in "market-making," which =
Enron is known for. That's the practice of ensuring orderly markets can exis=
t by acting as both the buyer and the seller of a commodity.=20
It's unclear whether Dynegy will continue Enron's foray into other commoditi=
es such as paper and metals.=20
Dynegy hopes Enron can complete its planned sale of assets considered outsid=
e its core wholesale energy business before the merger closes.=20
Enron already has deals to sell power utility Portland General Electric alon=
g with about $900 million in international assets. Billions of dollars in in=
ternational projects are for sale.=20
But Watson said Dynegy isn't interested in seeing the assets go at bargain-b=
asement prices.=20
"We don't necessarily feel like our back is pinned against the wall in asset=
 dispositions," he said.=20

Dynegy, Enron Stock Prices Get Boost Energy: Even as experts warn of regulat=
ory hurdles, investors back proposed merger.

Investors and analysts applauded the proposed $9-billion merger of Dynegy In=
c. and Enron Corp., boosting the stock price of both Houston-based energy co=
mpanies on Monday even as some experts warned of regulatory hurdles.=20
Dynegy and Enron executives courted Wall Street by offering assurances that =
the combined company, to be called Dynegy, would be more financially conserv=
ative and easier to understand than Enron has been.
Dynegy Chief Executive Charles L. Watson said the merger would immediately s=
weeten earnings for the combined company and that he remains "90% certain" t=
hat no more nasty surprises will emerge from a continuing internal investiga=
tion of Enron's cloudy finances.=20
"This is an exciting business combination ... that will fuse two groups of t=
alented, dedicated people who share a passion for their work," said Watson, =
who would be chairman and chief executive of the new company.=20
Dynegy's stock leaped $5.55 to close at $44.31 on the New York Stock Exchang=
e while Enron's stock increased 61 cents to $9.24.=20
The proposed transaction, revealed late Friday after days of rumors, marks a=
n extraordinary humbling of Enron and its powerful chairman and CEO, Kenneth=
 L. Lay. Enron is the world's largest energy trader, but a loss of investor =
confidence and a severe cash crunch have pushed it into the arms of a compet=
itor that is one-quarter its size.=20
Under the deal, Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each sh=
are of Enron stock. Based on the $38.76 close Friday of Dynegy's stock on th=
e New York Stock Exchange, the deal valued Enron's stock at $10.40 a share--=
or $11.89 a share based on Monday's close. Dynegy would convert 850 million =
Enron shares, the company said.=20
Dynegy said Monday that its deal is worth about $24 billion in all: the $9-b=
illion stock swap and the assumption of $2 billion of preferred stock and $1=
3 billion in debt. Enron would get an immediate cash infusion from ChevronTe=
xaco Corp., which owns nearly 27% of Dynegy, with an additional $1billion to=
 follow when the deal closes.=20
Enron's stock fell 80% after a series of disturbing financial disclosures th=
at began Oct. 16 with a surprise third-quarter loss tied to failed investmen=
ts in water and telecommunications and losses from the termination of some o=
ff-balance-sheet partnerships.=20
Enron also revealed that $1.2billion had been shaved off shareholders' equit=
y because of those partnerships. The Securities and Exchange Commission laun=
ched an investigation into the investment vehicles, and the company fired th=
ree executives linked to the partnerships.=20
An internal investigation led Enron to admit it overstated profit by $586 mi=
llion, or 20%, going back to 1997.=20
All those disclosures are unrelated to Enron's core businesses of energy tra=
ding, energy marketing and natural gas pipelines, said Dynegy President Stev=
e Bergstrom, and it is those businesses that Dynegy wants.=20
"We have had the opportunity to look under the hood of their core businesses=
 and have found no surprises," said Bergstrom, who would be president of the=
 combined company. Dynegy expects those businesses alone to add as much as 9=
5 cents a share to the combined company's earnings the first year, and Dyneg=
y has built protections into the deal if more surprises emerge from noncore =
businesses or off-balance-sheet partnerships, the executives said.=20
Among the protections: Dynegy or Enron would receive $350 million if the oth=
er backs out of the deal; Dynegy can abandon the transaction if lawsuit and =
financial liabilities exceed $3.5 billion; and if the deal falls apart, Dyne=
gy gets Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline.=20
The combined company would be leader in all of its primary businesses, Watso=
n said, with revenue of more than $200 billion and assets of more than $90 b=
illion. The new Dynegy would be the world's largest energy trader and would =
own 25,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 22,500 megawatts of electricit=
y generation.=20
It is that powerhouse role that may give regulators pause, energy and antitr=
ust experts say.=20
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has not taken a position on the proposed =
merger. Dynegy co-owns three power plants in California and Enron controls a=
 portion of the state's natural gas supply through its pipeline and trading =
businesses.

came to $614 million if you add unexercised option profits to the=20
millions he actually pocketed.=20

     Sad to say, Lay's paper profit of $362 million at the end of=20
2000 has evaporated as Enron's stock lost about 90 percent of its=20
value. The Houston, Texas, energy company, beset by accounting=20
problems, is now being bought by a smaller competitor, Dynegy=20
Inc.=20

     Still, the 59-year-old Lay hauled away $31.5 million a year=20
in real dollars over the last eight years, a generous amount=20
given Enron's recent admission -- after the Securities and=20
Exchange Commission opened an investigation -- that it overstated=20
earnings by $586 million in five of those years.=20

     Lay was Enron's CEO from the time it was formed 15 years ago=20
in a merger of natural-gas pipeline operators until he stepped=20
down in February for prot?g? Jeffrey Skilling. Skilling left=20
unexpectedly in August for ``personal'' reasons.=20
=20
                          CEO'S Return=20
=20
     In six months under Skilling, Enron's total return to=20
shareholders was a negative 46 percent, four times worse than the=20
performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. It was also a=20
sharp contrast to the 30 percent a year Enron returned to=20
shareholders over the previous eight years under Lay, when the=20
company's performance was almost double that of the S&P 500.=20

     So Lay became CEO again after Skilling's mid-August=20
departure -- and Enron's performance has now been even worse:=20
minus 78 percent versus the 5.8 percent negative return of for=20
the S&P 500.=20

     While Lay has an employment agreement extending all the way=20
to 2005, the company's pending acquisition by Dynegy leaves his=20
future in doubt. For Enron's battered shareholders, whose stock=20
once was among the S&P 500's top performers, that may not be such=20
bad news.=20

     Enron shareholders endured a roller-coaster ride during=20
Lay's long tenure, their stock 2.2 times as volatile as that of=20
the S&P 500 Index.=20

     Lay, and some other Enron executives, were responsible for=20
at least some of the heavy activity in their company's shares.=20
Lay exercised and sold option shares twice a day on every trading=20
day this year through Aug. 21, on last report. In the process, he=20
dumped about 300,000 option shares to reap about $26 million.=20
=20
                         Royal Treatment=20
=20
     That comes atop his realized option gains of $123 million in=20
2000 and another $44 million the year before that.=20

     Shedding large numbers of option shares might seem=20
reasonable for a CEO about to leave the company. For someone=20
continuing as board chairman, such behavior raises suspicion he=20
might have known before others what a bad investment Enron was=20
about to become.=20

     Over the past eight years, Lay has received bonuses totaling=20
$19.8 million, free shares worth $12.7 million at the time of=20
their grant, payouts under miscellaneous stock-option plans of=20
$3.5 million and a whopping 11 million option shares.=20

     Those figures don't include free personal travel on company=20
planes. In 2000 alone, that little item came to $334,000.=20

     If Lay has been handsomely compensated, he has treated his=20
outside directors royally. Enron's current proxy statement=20
informs shareholders that directors in 2000 received an average=20
of $79,107 in cash, deferred compensation, phantom stock units=20
and stock options granted in lieu of cash.=20
=20
                            Who Knew?=20
=20
     By itself, that figure might not seem egregious. Parsing the=20
artful language of the proxy, one reads further to find that each=20
outside director also received a stock option covering 10,775=20
shares at a strike price of $75.13 a share. I estimate the=20
present value of that option to be $315,000, making for a=20
director's total  pay of an eye-popping $394,000.=20

     To be sure, those options are now way underwater, given=20
Enron's closing price yesterday of $9.24. Still, the fact they=20
were granted at all suggests that Enron's directors must have had=20
a warm fuzzy feeling for Lay while treating him so munificently.=20

     Politically, too, Lay has shown generosity and a deft touch:=20
He gave $2,000 directly to President George W. Bush's campaign,=20
another $275,000 in soft money to the Republican party and has=20
long been an adviser to Bush on energy matters.=20

     Even if he was unaware of the accounting issues that helped=20
bring down Enron, Lay still profited hugely from a stock price=20
that soared on the strength of inflated numbers. And, as the CEO,=20
he bears ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the company=20
he helped found and has run for most of the past 15 years.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Dynegy deal brings balance back to market=
s.
By JULIE EARLE, SHEILA MCNULTY, PETER SPIEGEL and RICHARD WATERS.

Dynegy's rescue takeover of Enron brought stability back to the companies' s=
hare prices and the energy markets as trading resumed yesterday morning.=20
However, executives of the two companies faced a barrage of questions from i=
nvestors and analysts over concerns that they had not yet got to the bottom =
of the complex transactions that nearly brought Enron down.
Dynegy's shares jumped 15 per cent in early trade, while Enron's stock rose =
by more than 12 per cent, after the late-Friday deal that appeared to resolv=
e Enron's immediate financial crisis.=20
"It's a sensational deal for Dynegy," said John Olson of Sanders Morris Harr=
is, an investment banking firm in Houston. "It is clearly the best deal of t=
he year. When you can buy Enron at seven times earnings, at approximately bo=
ok value, warts and all, you're getting a very good deal." Dynegy said the m=
erger would lift its earnings per share by 35 per cent next year.=20
While the bounce in Enron's shares reflected relief that the company's immed=
iate liquidity crisis was over, they were still trading at less than a third=
 of their price of mid-October.=20
Charles Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, said the deal included =
provisions that would protect his company's shareholders if large unexpected=
 liabilities emerged at Enron. He added that he was confident that an invest=
igation into the off-balance sheet transactions at Enron had left little unc=
overed.=20
Dynegy is able to walk away from the deal if Enron suffers more than $3.5bn =
in costs from shareholder lawsuits and other liabilities stemming from its d=
isputed transactions, executives said. However, analysts questioned why, if =
Enron's core business was so strong, the company was being sold at such a di=
scount.=20
The deal could also face a tough review in Washington, given Dynegy's involv=
ement as a big trader in many of the same markets where Enron is the dominan=
t force.=20
Antitrust experts said the deal might not get approval unless Enron can qual=
ify as a "failing firm" under the Justice Department's 1992 merger guideline=
s.=20
A failing-firm defence, used most recently by TWA when it was bought out by =
American Airlines in March, would require Enron to prove there was no other =
avenue - either through bankruptcy reorganisation or acquisition by a third =
company - which would allow it to remain a viable competitor. It would also =
have to show that, without the merger, it would completely exit the market a=
ltogether.=20
Mr Watson also indicated that Dynegy would strip Enron's operations back to =
its core energy trading and pipeline businesses, raising the prospect of fur=
ther significant sales and write-downs.=20
"The $6.5bn of (international) assets on Enron's books will get marked down =
dramatically," said Mr Olson. "They also have to have a moment of truth with=
 the assets in their telecommunications business." Of about $1bn in broadban=
d, he expects Enron to write off about $600m in hard assets.=20
Other energy trading firms said that they were moving to reduce their exposu=
re to the company, as the InterContinental Exchange (Ice), Enron's online ri=
val, revealed record trading volumes last week, its best in 13 months of ope=
ration. Report by Sheila McNulty in Houston; Julie Earle and Richard Waters =

GLOBAL INVESTING - Spreading the risks - and the rewards.

11/13/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Just as Enron is showing us how a public company should not shift private eq=
uity exposure off its balance sheet, Sandy Schwab, son of Charles Schwab, an=
d Middlebury Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, are providing an alternat=
ive model.=20
Mr Schwab's firm Chess Ventures is raising a private equity fund that will s=
pecialise in financial services technology, according to a source close to t=
he fund-raising. The idea is to attract 10 to 12 banks from around the world=
 to co-invest in technology companies specialising in financial services.
The idea is similar to the corporate venturing activities undertaken by a ho=
st of California technology companies. They jumped into venture capital in t=
he late 1990s, not just because there seemed to be stacks of money to be mad=
e, but also so they could become partners to thrusting future competitors, r=
ather than victims of their cutting-edge technology.=20
Technology is also a vital business for financial services companies - and n=
ot just for those like Schwab with a heavy presence in internet trading. Eve=
ry year, banks and brokers plough hundreds of millions of dollars into tradi=
ng, settlement and risk management systems.=20
But the problems with corporate venturing became clear when companies such a=
s JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Dell and Intel registered significant earnin=
gs volatility as the value of their venture capital holdings was marked down=
 significantly.=20
Enron got around these problems by setting up an off-balance sheet vehicle w=
ith a number of additional investors. Its idea was to distance its earnings =
statement from volatile investments in the New Power Company and Rhythm NetC=
onnections. But eventually, those investments came home to roost.=20
Enron had to compensate it co-investors in the structure for their losses ar=
ising from its private equity investments, and paid a heavy price for the ap=
parent subterfuge of keeping them out of the public view.=20
The Schwab fund seems to offer the benefits of corporate venturing without s=
ome of its costs. The investors, who it is hoped will eventually contribute =
$100m to $150m to the new fund, will share the benefits of whatever technolo=
gy is developed and they will probably also be the first customers of the co=
mpanies they are sponsoring.=20
But because they are all taking a relatively small part of the pie they shou=
ld ameliorate their overall risk.=20
Spreading the risks like this would be hard to pull off in a totally domesti=
c structure. Corporate venturing is, after all, meant to give a company an e=
dge over its competitors.=20
But diversifying the fund internationally should allow the Chess fund to spr=
ead the risks. The fundraisers are talking to banks in the UK and Scandinavi=
a, among other places. If the theories of growing European cross-border inte=
gration and competition come to fruition some of the bank co-investors might=
 end up competing but in the meantime separating investors by geography seem=
s like a safe bet.=20
Schwab and the other investors could, of course, have put their money into o=
ther stand-alone venture funds. That would at least have solved the problem =
of keeping their volatile private equity exposure on balance sheet, but stan=
d-alone funds with the sharp focus that a corporate venturing outfit has are=
 fairly few and far between.=20
Corporate venture capital groups, where the corporation involved is a strate=
gic investor rather than just a speculator, are usually narrowly focused on =
their parent group's industry because they are in the business of helping th=
eir parent develop a strategic edge. A few venture firms focus very narrowly=
 on enterprise software but often they want to keep their options to invest =
in, say, biotechnology, if that area suddenly looks promising.=20
For non-strategic investors that approach has clear advantages. Technology i=
nvestments have suffered over the last 18 months, while biotech investments =
have held up relatively well. If investors are right about the dramatic impa=
ct of information technology on biotechnology, investors in a general fund t=
hat has had the foresight to bet on those changes will probably do very well=
=2E=20
But the Schwab approach is all about venturing as a way to extend research a=
nd development. Venturing can tap into the reserves of entrepreneurship that=
 have served the US so well in the 1990s in a way that traditional research =
and development probably cannot.=20
Entrepreneurship does, however, come at a price. Young companies can and do =
fail. Their values can swing wildly.=20
An off-balance sheet approach with clear strategic benefits might allow comp=
anies to have their cake and eat it.=20

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron reaps the whirlwind.
By PETER MARTIN.

11/13/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron reaps the whirlwind - The energy group succeeded =
brilliantly for a time by creating markets to trade risk, but ended up absor=
bing too much.=20
Enron's fate is a test case for one of the current era's most powerful belie=
fs. Actively traded markets, says the new orthodoxy, will replace cumbersome=
 monolithic businesses.
Electricity, computer chips, telecoms bandwidth, weather risks, petroleum pr=
oducts, reinsurance, housing finance, advertising space - the list of goods =
and services which the new market alchemy would transform is endless.=20
Even 20 years ago, most of these commodities were exclusively handled throug=
h vertically integrated business empires. Some of them did not even exist as=
 identifiable products, they were so tightly enmeshed with the business that=
 produced and sold them.=20
It all goes back to 1979. Together, the second oil shock and the election of=
 Margaret Thatcher in Britain ushered in the market wave, forcing deregulati=
on in the US oil and gas industries and a stream of utility privatisation.=20
Enron, originally just a natural gas pipeline business, seized on the new op=
portunities - first in the US gas business, then in other areas of energy su=
ch as electricity, then in a much wider range of goods.=20
It started trading these products and services as commodities. It was not an=
 old-fashioned utility any more, but it was also more than a simple trader.=20
Instead, as its former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling put it: "Enron's ope=
rations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies an=
d physical technologies." It brought derivatives theory to boring old busine=
sses like gas and electricity; and it brought a set of assets that could pro=
vide security of supply to the new dematerialised energy trading.=20
We will come back to what went wrong at Enron later. But first notice how mu=
ch went right in the newly market-oriented industries. Critics argued that a=
n integrated business, tightly controlled from the centre, was essential for=
 security of supply. But British electricity privatisation proved you could =
switch to a market-oriented system quickly and smoothly - and the lights sta=
yed on.=20
All you needed were proper regulations, a freely operating supply side and a=
 bunch of active market-makers. These were not always present - for example,=
 the absence of the first two gave California an electricity shortage. But i=
f the markets were properly set up, everything worked like clockwork.=20
The new era had a simple creed. Before there were effective markets, compani=
es needed to be vertically integrated to cope with unexpected fluctuations i=
n demand and supply. But now markets allowed them to handle that risk more e=
fficiently, buying and selling what they needed. Trading exploded: Enron alo=
ne recorded revenues of over $100bn ( #68bn) in 2000.=20
So what did go wrong? Enron expanded its markets too aggressively, moving fa=
r beyond energy through a web-based platform called EnronOnline. As Mr Skill=
ing put it in an interview with BusinessWeek: "We're on the side of angels. =
We're taking on the entrenched monopolies. We're bringing the benefits of ch=
oice and free markets to the world."=20
Expensively, Enron rushed into trading telecoms bandwidth, building a big ne=
twork to ensure it could deliver a scale of demand that never materialised.=20
Mr Skilling left abruptly in August, citing personal reasons. This autumn th=
e company announced it had been engaging in transactions with supposedly ind=
ependent entities that should, in fact, have been consolidated with its own =
accounts. Some of these were headed - in a clear conflict of interest - by i=
ts own chief financial officer. Correcting the accounting caused big restate=
ments of earnings.=20
This may, of course, just be the growing pains of an innovative but overly a=
mbitious company. In that case, Enron may prosper under new ownership - it a=
greed to be taken over by Dynegy, a much smaller rival, on Friday. Dynegy wi=
ll slash the range of Enron's activities to focus on energy. If the sale goe=
s through, such an approach may restore Enron to health.=20
But perhaps the Enron problems tell us something more significant about the =
rush to turn formerly integrated businesses into markets.=20
To get these to work requires active market-makers like Enron. Creating liqu=
idity in previously illiquid markets soaks up capital. Nalin Kulatilaka, pro=
fessor of finance at Boston University's management school, has studied Enro=
n for years. "The bottom line is that when the liquidity on the two sides of=
 a market are very different," he says, "a company that tries to lead the wa=
y in creating these marketplaces is going to bear sustained liquidity risks.=
"=20
The risks that the old system had coped with by building a layer of ineffici=
ency into its operations did not go away in the new market era. Enron knew a=
ll about these risks: managing them, through complex trades, was its essenti=
al skill.=20
James Lam, founder of the consultancy eRisk, says: "Enron has always been re=
cognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in s=
ystems to manage risk on a real time basis, and had very strong management."=
=20
But risk is a bit like a balloon. Squeeze it down in one area and it bulges =
out in another. Even if the operational risk was managed with great skill, t=
he underlying riskiness of the strategy Enron was pursuing could not be wish=
ed away. Except, perhaps, by transactions that passed it on to outside entit=
ies. The problem was that those entities were not really outside at all.=20
Despite Enron's problems, the shift to a market-based approach is now irreve=
rsible - for energy markets at least. Ed Krapels, who runs Energy Security A=
nalysis in Boston, says: "Clearly Enron's trading culture has been adopted b=
y every one of the big oil companies except Exxon."=20
But, he adds, there is a big difference between companies with trading at th=
eir core, like Enron and Dynegy, and those that have added a trading approac=
h to a business fundamentally based on physical assets, such as BP. The leve=
rage and aggression in such businesses is much lower.=20
Dynegy's rescue of Enron was only made possible by an injection of cash from=
 ChevronTexaco, which owns 26 per cent of Dynegy's shares. Call it the reven=
ge of the entrenched monopolies. Energy markets may not be as efficient with=
out an aggressive Enron. But if they come back into the embrace of the big p=
hysical operators, they may cope a little better with the unpredictable risk=
iness of the real world.=20

HOUSTON -- Arthur Andersen may face U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission =
sanction and shareholder lawsuits because it certified Enron Corp. financial=
 reports that the company disavowed last week as inaccurate, legal and accou=
nting experts said.=20
Andersen, the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, served as Enron's outsi=
de auditor for more than a decade. Last week, the company reported that it o=
verstated earnings by $586 million over 41/2 years, inflated shareholder equ=
ity by $1.2 billion because of an "accounting error," and failed to consolid=
ate results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.
Enron restated its financial reports as the company suffered a cash crisis t=
riggered by disclosure of the cut in shareholder equity and the start of an =
SEC investigation.=20
"I'd be very surprised if the SEC didn't go after Arthur Andersen," said Ala=
n Bromberg, securities law professor at Southern Methodist University.=20
Andersen partner David Tabolt has said the firm is cooperating with a specia=
l committee of Enron's board of directors appointed to investigate the accou=

Lynn Turner, who was the SEC's chief accountant for three years until he res=
igned in August, said Enron and Andersen ignored a basic accounting rule whe=
n they overstated shareholder equity.=20
Explaining the equity reduction last week, Enron said it had given common st=
ock to companies created by Enron's former chief financial officer in exchan=
ge for notes receivable, and then improperly increased shareholder equity on=
 its balance sheet by the value of the notes.=20
"What we teach in college is that you don't record equity until you get cash=
 for it, and a note is not cash," said Turner, who is now director of the Ce=

Investors upbeat about merger between Dynegy and Enron
By JUAN A. LOZANO
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - While troubled Enron Corp. brings a certain amount of financi=
al baggage in its union with rival Dynegy Inc., the merger will create a new=
 company that while strong won't dominate the energy market, according to se=
veral analysts.=20
But others still expressed concerns with the deal between the two Houston-ba=
sed companies, citing strategic and cultural differences between the two com=
panies and potential antitrust issues.
Meanwhile, investors on Monday gave a tentative thumbs up to the merger. Dyn=
egy shares rose $5.55, or 14 percent, to close at $44.31, while Enron shares=
 were up 61 cents, or 7 percent to $9.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Enron's financial crises had left many fearing severe disruptions in the ene=
rgy market, Daniel Ford, an analyst with Lehman Brothers wrote Monday in a r=
esearch note to clients.=20
"We believe the terms of the announced merger agreement are a path to resolv=
ing these fears," Ford wrote.=20
Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., said any antitr=
ust concerns that might arise from the deal will be minimal because the ener=
gy market will be able to absorb the new company's impact.=20
"While there is risk, the prize is so big the parties will go through it and=
 the deal will ultimately close," Grubert said.=20
But Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., wrote in a rese=
arch note to clients she had several concerns about the deal, including whet=
her Dynegy will be successful in retaining Enron's "talented" energy trading=
 and marketing personnel and whether both companies have compatible trading =
strategies.=20
Dynegy officials said Monday the proposed deal was "doable," would clear all=
 antitrust hurdles and be completed within nine months.=20
"What we have done is literally taken the worst case (scenario) and even in =
the worst case there is a lot of economic value for both companies," said Ch=
uck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Dynegy, during a confere=
nce call Monday.=20
The deal, worth at least $9 billion, was announced Friday. Dynegy will also =
assume $13 billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will disappear.=20
Under the deal, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns more than a quarter of Dyneg=
y, would immediately provide about $1.5 billion. ChevronTexaco would contrib=
ute an additional $1 billion upon completion of the deal.=20
Dynegy's earnings for 2002, before the merger, were expected to range betwee=
n $2.50 and $2.60. The buyout now raises that to between $3.40 and $3.50, sa=
id company spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser.=20
According to Thomson Financial/First Call, analysts were expecting Dynegy to=
 earn $2.57 a share next year.=20
Dynegy officials pledged Monday that they won't tolerate the sort of financi=
al practices that prompted Enron to acknowledge last week that it overstated=
 earnings by about 20 percent since 1997.=20
Those financial practices included business partnerships now under investiga=
tion by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Enron, the nation's top buyer and seller of natural gas reported a $618 mill=
ion third quarter loss on Oct. 16 and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in =
shareholder equity related to the partnerships. Worries about Enron's financ=
ial stability eventually caused shares to plunge 80 percent, leaving Enron o=
pen for a takeover bid.=20
Officials with both companies said if for some reason the deal falls through=
, Dynegy will be given Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline in compensation=
 for the $1.5 billion cash infusion Enron received.=20
The agreement also has a clause that would allow Dynegy to opt out of the de=
al if Enron's litigation and other costs surpass $3.5 billion, Dynegy offici=
als said Monday.=20

Dynegy seen as winner in Enron deal ; Firm gets rights to key pipeline

Shares of Dynegy Inc. shot up 14 percent on Monday as investors calculated t=
hat the Houston-based power-trading company will win big whether or not regu=
lators approve its blockbuster merger with hometown rival Enron Corp.=20
Under terms of the deal, Dynegy executives said in a conference call with an=
alysts on Monday, their company will get rights to Enron's prized Northern N=
atural Gas pipeline in return for $1.5 billion invested in Enron. Moreover, =
the deal calls for Enron to pay Dynegy $350 million if Enron walks away to a=
ccept a higher bid from another company.
Particularly lucrative for Dynegy, analysts said, are the rights it obtained=
 to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The pipeline is an interstate=
 transmission system, providing transportation among other supply conduits a=
nd serving customers in the upper Midwest through a 17,000-mile network.=20
For this and other reasons, Dynegy stock closed at $44.31, up $5.55, on the =
first trading day after the $24 billion merger deal was announced.=20
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, has been =
bowed in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by=
 one of its former executives and by a revelation about questionable account=
ing practices. Enron last week was forced to revise down its earnings for th=
e past five years and has seen its debt ratings downgraded and its stock pri=
ce plummet.=20
But Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief executive, said during the conference call =
that he did not anticipate any more nasty surprises arising from Enron's con=
voluted books. "We literally have taken what we think is the worst case scen=
ario," Watson said. "I'm comfortable that even in that case this is a very, =
very good economic transaction for both companies."=20
Dynegy executives estimated an annual earnings-per-share growth of 15 percen=
t to 20 percent for the combined company over the next three years.=20
Under the stock-for-stock-swap portion of the deal, valued at $8.85 billion,=
 Dynegy is paying the equivalent of $10.41 a share for the 850 million outst=
anding Enron shares. Dynegy would pay .2685 shares of its stock for each sha=
re of Enron. In addition, Dynegy agreed to assume an estimated $13 billion i=
n debt.=20
It is conceivable that additional problems with Enron's off- balance sheet p=
artnerships could kill the proposed deal between the two power-trading rival=
s.=20
But on Monday, Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive, said: "We don't have an=
ything we are trying to hide. On the contrary, we have been very forthcoming=
 of everything we have found. We have disclosed anything and everything that=
 we have found so far."=20
Despite its sanguine outlook on the deal, Dynegy officials acknowledged that=
 they have escape clauses in their offer. For example, Dynegy can renege on =
the deal if pending litigation against Enron, which includes a slew of lawsu=
its filed by disgruntled investors who have lost millions of dollars, exceed=
s $3.5 billion in costs.=20
Since last Wednesday, when Dynegy shares closed at $33, the stock has risen =
more than 33 percent. After rumors began swirling last Thursday that it was =
in talks with Enron, its shares rose to $36.50. On Friday, after making the =
bid for Enron, its shares closed at $38.76, for a rise of 17.5 percent in tw=
o days of trading.=20
By comparison, Enron stock rose 7.1 percent, to $9.24, on Monday and has ris=
en only 2 percent since last Wednesday.=20
Dynegy officials on Monday also sought to quell rumors that the deal was gre=
ased because Enron owed Dynegy money. In fact, "Dynegy currently owes Enron.=
=2E.less than $50 million," said Rob Doty, chief financial officer of Dynegy=

UK: Innogy restarts energy trading with Enron.

LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - British power company Innogy on Tuesday said it h=

In the first confirmation that it had stopped trading with the U.S. group, I=

 business will resume".
Innogy said there had been little impact on it as a result of the suspension=

But industry experts said the implications for Enron could be larger because=
 a number of large European energy groups suspended dealings with it at the =
end of last month.=20
Enron ran into a crisis of investor confidence in mid-October when it disclo=

NEW YORK -- Shares of Enron Corp. climbed higher yesterday on investor enthu=
siasm over last week's $9-billion (U.S.) bid by rival energy trader Dynegy I=
nc. to take over the beleaguered energy giant.=20
Dynegy gained $5.55, or 14.3 per cent, to $44.31 on the New York Stock Excha=
nge, while shares of Enron rose 69 cents, or 8 per cent, to $9.32. The takeo=
ver announced Friday halted a free-fall in Enron's stock that lost about 75 =
per cent of its market capitalization in the past month.
However, Enron's stock was trading well below the value of Dynegy's offer of=
 0.2685 Dynegy shares for each Enron share, which translates into $11.94 a s=
hare. Analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as =
to whether the deal, which includes "escape clauses" for Dynegy, will go thr=
ough.=20
Some industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offer=
ed by Dynegy during a conference call with analysts, an about-face compared =
with calls with Enron. A lack of transparency from Enron about its off-balan=
ce-sheet transactions, along with a U.S. regulatory investigation, had spark=
ed widespread investor unease.=20
"I would say that after listening to the conference call, I am even more com=
fortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative," sa=
id Jay Yannello, an analyst with UBS Warburg.=20
Earlier, Mr. Yannello reiterated a "strong buy" on Dynegy, saying while the =
brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand, the takeove=
r should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world. D=
ynegy is about one-fifth the size of Enron when measured by revenues.=20
Enron's woes came to light in mid-October after the biggest energy trader in=
 North America disclosed that some of its off-balance-sheet partners contrib=
uted to a $1-billion charge and a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equi=
ty.=20
The takeover is an attractive transaction because of Enron's trading operati=
ons, which combined with Dynegy's above-board culture based on teamwork, str=
ict values and honesty, should yield a formidable company, Mr. Yannello said=
=2E=20
However, last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely exam=
ined by the Federal Trade Commission because of the combined company's marke=
t share in energy trading, said Steve Newborn, formerly in charge of FTC mer=
ger enforcement.=20
Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities, said he is favourab=
ly disposed toward the takeover, which he called a "low risk-high reward pro=
position."=20
The most critical component is the immediate $1.5-billion equity infusion by=
 Dynegy shareholder ChevronTexaco Corp. into Enron that will bolster Enron a=
nd help keep it viable.=20
Some analysts are less sanguine. They said Dynegy is making a big bet that i=
t can successfully clean up Enron's balance sheet problems as well as integr=
ate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders a=
nd volumes.

City - City Comment - Enron's end provides textbook disaster study.

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

A YEAR ago Enron, North America's biggest natural gas and power business wit=
h a growing European presence, chalked up $101 billion in revenues and saw i=
ts market value reach the giddy heights of almost $80 billion.=20
Yesterday it was coming to terms with being part of Dynegy, its junior rival=
 in Houston, taken out at a price which just allows it to escape the ignomin=
y of the 90pc club. In less than three weeks the one-time Wall Street darlin=
g has been humbled by a sequence of events that stunned the market and will =
provide business schools with a classic casebook disaster study.
The Enron demise is one which cannot be blamed on the events of September 11=
=2E A third-quarter loss, followed by an equity write-down, the disclosure o=
f questionable off-balance-sheet businesses, an admission that earnings have=
 been over-stated and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation bro=
ught Enron to the brink of collapse.=20
Ken Lay, its chairman, had taken full advantage of market deregulation to bu=
ild Enron into a multi-national utility with a network of power plants, gas =
pipelines and a powerful trading presence, in everything from energy to meta=
ls. It trades these from an office in Victoria which employs 2,000 people, a=
nd Mr Lay might have wondered rather earlier how this army of people could p=
ossibly pay for themselves, even in his brave new deregulated world.=20
Now Dynegy has picked up Enron cheaply, and must find its way off debt mount=
ain before the financial weather gets worse. The new group has sales of more=
 than $200 billion, and assets in the books at $90 billion. A fire sale is i=
nevitable, including that of Wessex Water, sold to Enron for $1.4 billion th=
ree years ago. It will probably not fetch more than $400m today, and even at=
 that price is not obviously cheap.

Power major BSES, which has evinced keen interest in acquiring a 85 per cent=
 stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), has sought mega power project stat=
us for the Dabhol project.=20
"We have suggested this as one of the measures for bringing down the capital=
 cost of the project which, in turn, will translate into lower tariffs. This=
 has been mooted by us at various meetings with the government as well as in=
 the recent meeting with lenders at Singapore," R V Shahi, chairman and mana=
ging director, BSES.
The conferring of such a status will enable the project to bag a slew of tax=
 concessions including reduction in customs duties. It will also enable the =
plant to sell power across states.=20
Global energy major Enron which holds 65 per cent stake in DPC has decided t=

Dynegy's Plan to Acquire Enron in Deal Valued at $10.12 Billion Boosts Share=

The shares of Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. both rose in heavy trading as inve=
stors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of Dynegy's plan=
 to acquire Enron in a stock swap with a current value of $10.12 billion, Th=
e Wall Street Journal reported.=20
In calls and meetings with analysts Monday, Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson and=
 Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay continued talking up the deal that was announced=
 late Friday. "We are confident this is good strategically and financially f=
or Dynegy and Enron," said Mr. Watson, who will serve as chairman and chief =
executive of the combined entity, to be called Dynegy Inc.
While the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies=
 and gives Dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal, investors' init=
ial reaction to the merger announcement was positive. As of 4 p.m. in New Yo=
rk Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, Dynegy (DYN) shares were at $44.=
31, up $5.55, or 14%. Also on the Big Board, Enron (ENE) was at $9.24, up 7.=
1%, or 61 cents. Both companies were among the most actively traded issues.=20
Under terms of the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would give 0.2685 of its sha=
res for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy's stock price Monday, this formula=
 values Enron stock at $11.90 each. Enron has about 850 million shares outst=
anding.=20
Some people raised cautionary notes Monday. Moody's Investors Service placed=
 Dynegy on review for a possible credit-ratings downgrade. Standard & Poor's=
 made a similar move on Friday. Moody's said that while it saw positive elem=
ents to the proposed combination, it also believed "the financial and busine=
ss risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's cr=
edit fundamentals."=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale, who counts herself a fan of Dyneg=
y, also worries that Enron's enormous problems could be a drag on the combin=
ed entity. "I don't want the Dynegy folks to get into something that's not g=
ood for the company," she said.=20
Enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the=
 investment community plummet, largely as the result of large-scale transact=
ions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers. Those transactions h=
ave produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write-offs and restatements =
in the past month. They are being investigated by the Securities and Exchang=

USA: DynegyDirect, EnronOnline to trade separately for now.

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Online energy trading leader EnronOnline will m=
erge with smaller rival DynegyDirect after its parent company Enron Corp. ag=
reed last week to a $9 billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. , Dynegy said Monday.=
=20
The integration of the two platforms will take about six to nine months, Dyn=
egy said. In the meantime, the two will continue to operate separately.
"We're looking to take the best of both platforms for the integrated company=
," said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa. "(The emerging platform) will continue =
to be based on a one-to-many philosophy as it stands now."=20
On both EnronOnline and DynegyDirect traders can only deal with Enron and Dy=
negy, respectively.=20
EnronOnline is the biggest online energy trading platform in the United Stat=
es, with a daily average of $2.6 billion in trades in the past month.=20
DynegyDirect is a much smaller, though growing platform. It recorded nearly =
$10 billion in transactions in the third quarter.=20
The two platforms offer trading in hundreds of products and services, from c=
rude oil and refined products, to natural gas and electricity. Most of the t=
rading is done in U.S. markets, but some European markets are available as w=
ell.=20
Enron, currently North America's biggest buyer and seller of both natural ga=
s and electricity, agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a s=
eries of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe into the off-balance sh=
eet dealings, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit r=
ating downgrades.=20
However, Dynegy can drop its offer if more bad news emerges, or if pending l=
awsuits against Enron lead to more than $3.5 billion in costs.=20
Dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover will win U.S. regulatory appro=
val and said it does not expect any antitrust concerns to impede the merger =
of the two electronic platforms.=20
Dynegy shares gained $5.55, or 14.3 percent, to $44.31 on the New York Stock=
 Exchange, while shares of Enron rose 61 cents, or 7 percent, to $9.24.=20
The takeover halted a free-fall in Enron's stock that lost about 75 percent =

Dynegy Bid for Enron Doesn't Calm Credit Concerns, Traders Say
2001-11-12 17:49 (New York)

Dynegy Bid for Enron Doesn't Calm Credit Concerns, Traders Say

     New York, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Some energy traders said
they are still wary of business with Enron Corp., which has agreed
to be bought by rival Dynegy Inc. for about $23 billion in stock
and assumed debt.

     ``We're continuing to trade with them on a very limited
basis, and we'll continue to do so until the proposed Dynegy
buyout develops further,'' said James Peters, a spokesman for
energy trader Mirant Corp.

     Traders had scaled back business with Enron recently. Before
today, its stock had plummeted 90 percent this year. The biggest
energy trader faced a cash crunch and a loss of investor
confidence because of questions about partnerships it started and
put under the control of its senior executives. Investors feared
the company was using the partnerships to hide losses and debt.

     Dynegy said late Friday it agreed to buy Enron for about
$8 billion in stock and $15 billion in assumed debt. A quick end
to Enron's woes is far from assured because the company still is
facing scrutiny from securities, antitrust and energy-market
regulators, executives said.

     ``Our credit guys are a still a little nervous'' about
dealing with Enron, said Michael Steffes, vice president of
marketing and trading at Indianapolis-based Aces Power Marketing
LLC, which buys and sells power on behalf of electric cooperatives
in the U.S. Midwest. ``They're relieved that something's happened,
but they haven't changed their tack.''

     Two weeks ago, closely held Aces decided to halt trading
electricity contracts stretching out two to 10 years with Enron,
Steffes said. On Friday, it limited trading to same-day or next-
day purchases or sales. The company has no plans to lift those
restrictions now, Steffes said.

                           Credit Rating

     Many traders would have banned business with Enron if its
credit rating had been downgraded to junk, industry officials
said. As a result, there would have been fewer willing buyers and
sellers in the energy markets, making trades more difficult to
complete. Moody's Investors Service on Friday lowered its rating
on Enron's long-term debt to ``Baa3,'' one notch above junk.

     Some gas distributors in the northern U.S. that have long-
term natural-gas supply contracts with Enron were lining up
alternate suppliers, according to Gelber & Associates Corp., an
energy-trading adviser in Houston. The companies didn't want to
take any chances of an Enron default that might leave them short
of gas during the peak of the winter heating season.

                        `No Clear Sailing'

     ``You just have to be cautious until there's clear sailing,''
said Charlie Sanchez, energy-markets manager at closely held
Gelber. ``There's no indication that there's clear sailing here.''

     Some companies that had reduced their dealings with Enron in
recent weeks said the merger announcement had helped ease their
credit concerns. Spinnaker Exploration Co., a gas and oil producer
which had ``lightened up'' its trading with Enron, is now willing
to consider new deals, Chief Executive Officer Roger Jarvis said.

     ``The merger makes me feel a lot more comfortable'' about
doing business with Enron, Jarvis said. ``I don't think there is
anything wrong with the Enron trading franchise. This is a very
good outcome for them and for the gas business in general.''

     Shares of Dynegy surged $5.55, or 14 percent, to $44.31 after
Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson told investors the Enron
purchase will boost profit by 35 percent next year. Enron rose 61
cents to $9.24. Dynegy, Enron and Spinnaker are based in Houston.

     EnronOnline, the  Internet trading system, expected more than
5,000 transactions today, a 25 percent increase over Thursday and
Friday, spokesman Eric Thode said. That's 11 percent below the 30-
day average of about 5,600.

     Atlanta-based Mirant is moving to woo long-term Enron
customers still nervous by the firm's credit downgrades.

     ``The market's a lot bigger than Enron,'' Peters said. ``This
merger allows Mirant to step up its marketing to long-term
customers who have recently been served by Enron.''

Dynegy to Ask J.P. Morgan, Salomon to Reduce $90 Mln Enron Fee

Dynegy to Ask J.P. Morgan, Salomon to Reduce $90 Mln Enron Fee

     New York, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Charles Watson, chief
executive officer of Dynegy Inc., wants J.P. Morgan Chase & Co and
Salomon Smith Barney to accept less than the $90 million they
charged Enron Corp. for merger advice.

     ``It sounds a little high,'' said Watson, whose company
agreed on Friday to acquire Enron for $23 billion in stock and
debt. ``If the fees are exorbitant, I'm going to realign them to
where I think they should be.''

     Salomon and J.P. Morgan Chase may balk at giving up fees that
people familiar with the transaction said were $45 million each
during a year when merger business has plunged 50 percent, bankers
said. The payout is the largest for advising a company to be
acquired this year, according to data compiled by Dealogic.

    ``In the current environment, investment banks will be torn
between trying to hold onto fees they've already negotiated and
trying not do anything that would cut into fees in the future,''
said Brian Sullivan, managing partner for financial services at
Heidrick & Struggles Inc., a recruitment firm.

     J.P. Morgan Chase spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau and Salomon
Smith Barney spokesman Duncan King declined to comment.

     While Salomon and J.P. Morgan Chase negotiated their fees
with Enron, Watson is hoping the firms will accept less in
exchange for the promise of future business. The fees for each
bank are three times the $15 million Dynegy is paying its adviser,
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to people familiar with
the situation. Lehman spokeswoman Hannah Burns declined comment.

                            Record Fees

     The fees may be higher in part because Salomon and J.P.
Morgan Chase also agreed to extend $1 billion in credit to restore
investor confidence. J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon also offered to
invest another $500 million in the combined company, said people
familiar with the transaction.

     ``Maybe there were extenuating circumstances, related to
financing,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, an
affiliate of Wall Street Access Inc.

     Watson said that unlike Enron, which was forced to restate
earnings for the past four-and-a-half years and reduce earnings by
$586 million, Dynegy didn't face a cash shortage and so was
unlikely to sell an equity stake to Salomon and J.P. Morgan Chase.

     ``I don't want or need their money,'' Watson said today in an
interview. The two banks' terms for any investment probably would
be ``too expensive,'' he said.

     Enron's cash needs until the merger closes, projected in the
third quarter of next year, will be met by the transfer tomorrow
of $1.5 billion from ChevronTexaco Corp., the largest shareholder
in Dynegy, and the $1 billion credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase
and Salomon, said Robert Doty, Dynegy's chief financial officer.

     The largest previous investment banking fee for a takeover
announced this year was a $50 million fee split by Credit Suisse
First Boston and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for their advice to
Wachovia Corp. in its $13.6 billion purchase by First Union Corp.

     Morgan Stanley got about $75 million for advising Time Warner
in its sale to American Online Inc., according to bankers. That
acquisition, which formed AOL Time Warner Inc. in January, had a
value of $186 billion when it was announced last year.
