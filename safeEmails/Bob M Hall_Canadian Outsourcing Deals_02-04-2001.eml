I met with Peggy Hedstrom and to some extent with Laura Scott  in Calgary=20
regarding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer=20
outsourcing deals.


The producer provides to EC their projected production schedule for the year=
=20
by month by plant outlet. This information is entered into Sitara by EC on a=
=20
single ticket with no meter information. For the prompt month EC confirms=20
back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day. This=
=20
includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their dail=
y=20
flows. This information is contained within a Excel spreadsheet which can be=
=20
viewed by the producer via a common network drive.

The producer communicates to EC their sales for the month and on a daily=20
basis. EC enters these trades in Sitara. The Sitara position by producer is=20
balanced to zero daily. The producer does not have access to Sitara.

EC acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer. They=20
have no diversion rights on this transport, it is utilised at the direction=20
of the producer. EC nominates producers transport. All transport expense=20
estimates are maintained by EC. EC is invoiced and pays the pipeline.

EC monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by=20
Nova. It is the responsibility of EC to inform the producer of significant=20
variances in their scheduled versus estimated flows. Nova requires that=20
shippers be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out=
=20
of tolerance. It is EC's responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty=20
situations. The producer, at the direction of EC, either sells or buys on an=
=20
intraday basis to balance their position on the pipeline. Final estimated=20
flows are then downloaded by EC into the Excel spreadsheet. This final=20
estimate is than used as the expected volume for the upcoming day.  And=20
Sitara is updated accordingly.

At months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting=20
system referred to as Solomon. Actual volumes as provided by the pipeline ar=
e=20
also entered into the system for settlement. I didn't have a lot of time to=20
devote to the accounting process, but I doubt ENA would take this approach.

EC utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics an=
d=20
origination standpoint. Peggy said they did not hire people specifically fro=
m=20
the producer/customers but did seek out people with extensive producer=20
experience to assist with these customers. Peggy feels that their success is=
=20
due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed wit=
h=20
their customers through this point of contact approach.

It is of note that Unify is not utilised in managing these customers=20
business. Peggy feels that Unify is not  designed to handle it and response=20
time is too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are=20
working under on a daily basis.
