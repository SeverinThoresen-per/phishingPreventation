I don't think you need to have a separate payroll deduction document at term=
ination, but it probably would be good to provide them with a copy of the on=
e they previously signed.

My thought was that it may make sense to remind all Amex card holders of the=
 policy so that there are no surprises at termination.

Thank you ma'am for your quick response.=20

I can work with Cheryl Slone, Johnny Ross & Ryan regarding the communication=
 to all current Amex users. As for the communication to the HR Community, I =
can get that out today to make this new implementation to our Termination pr=
ocess effective 10/01/01. =20

Now, my only additional question now is, the employee has already signed the=
 Amex Agreement as I specified below, do you see a need for me to include an=
 additional document in the Termination packet for the employee to acknowled=
ge as well for that Payroll deduction. I was planning on it since they have =
already signed the Amex agreement, but, if you think we (The HR Svc Connecti=
on) should, please let me know and I will prepare something and run it by yo=
u.

Please advise.

Thxs,

I like this approach.  Let's document it and let people know.  We probably w=
ant to send some sort of communication to persons holding an Amex card, and =
I believe that Ryan Seleznov is looking at our overall process of who actual=
ly gets a card. Thus, I am copying her on this email.  Michelle

Michelle,

I met with Cheryl Slone & Johnny Ross yesterday regarding our current In-eff=
ective termination process when it comes to American Express balances for te=
rminated employees. =20

After sitting down with both, I made my recommendations and I got their feed=
back as well.  It seems that the following outlined recommendations is what =
we both agreed upon and would like to implement immediately.  However, I wou=
ld like your blessing on this before I actually send out the communication t=
o my team and the EWS HR Community. =20

I have attached our current termination process flow. =20

Recommendations from yesterday's mtg.=20

1) Begin requesting an American Express balance at the same time we send the=
 request for the stock option summary.

2) Provide balance sheet in termination folder for generalist to conduct the=
 Exit interview.

3) Reiterate to employee their signed corporate card agreement, Number 9, wh=
ich you can see in the attachment below.=20
	I understand that UPON MY TERMINATION I will have to pay any outstanding ba=
lance owed on the Corporate Card
	PRIOR to receiving my final check.  I hereby authorize Enron to withhold fr=
om my check or checks, any and all amounts
	outstanding.

4) Since the employe will be processing a final expense report and will be r=
eceiving a check from the expense report group, an automatic deduction from =
their final check for their balance should not be a great impact for them.

5) This will reduce the time and energy that HR Reps spend tracking ex-emplo=
yees after the fact and confirming that they have paid Amex, after they have=
 received their final Expense Report.

6) My team has the access to include Amex balance withholding as part of our=
 SAP Termination action before payroll finalizes.

7) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!  This reduces the liability that Enron has had to inc=
ur with Amex and will save our Company a tremendous amount of money.  =20

8) For those balances that are more than the actual final check amount, the =
HR Svc Connection will work with the generalist on a case by case basis.

Again, if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap, that woul=
d be great.

Thank you ma'am.
