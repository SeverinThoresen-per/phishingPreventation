Monday, September 11 at 3pm for 45 minutes or so works fine. I plan to
arrive at Bush International airport at 12 noon and depart at 6pm. I very
much look forward to our meeting and discussion. A preliminary list of some
of the largest Houston corporations would include (Compaq Computer, American
General, BMC Software, Conoco, Sysco, Waste Management, Coastal, Houston
Industries, Baker Hughes, Shell Oil), but we can discuss this once we've
outlined the objectives of such a regional meeting to promote the case for
corporate philanthropy. Chuck Lee (Verizon) is planning to host a similar
meeting in Dallas.
