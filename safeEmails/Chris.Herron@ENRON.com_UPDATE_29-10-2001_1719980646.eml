Everyone:

Thanks are due to you all who responded to our requests for data and committ=
ed resources.  I wanted to update you on where things stands as of now. =20

The data is being reviewed both internally and externally. The form and subs=
tance of the data we have requested, the due diligence questionnaires, and E=
nron's previously produced forms of data are excellent proxies for the infor=
mation that will be required from us when a specific bank is chosen to struc=
ture and execute the anticipated transaction.  However, I am certain that we=
 will still require your commitment to providing updates, clarifications, an=
d additions on a timely basis.  Please let us know as soon as possible what =
conflicts may arise with your schedules and obligations over the next month.

Again, thank you for your efforts thus far.  Please call me at extension 331=
39 if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.

Best regards,
Chris Herron
