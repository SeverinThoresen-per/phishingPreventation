I have not been able to get ahold of Jon McKay and have heard through the gr=
apevine that he has gone to Houston with Enron.  Therefore, I am contacting =
you to try to get some information necessary for the assembly of the month e=
nd pie chart.  I am wondering if Jonathan has designated responsibility for =
getting the information to us on the last business day of every month.  Also=
, I would like to get the July near month information to do a test run.  If =
possible please forward me this information or let me know who to contact to=
 get the necessary information.
Thanks,=20
