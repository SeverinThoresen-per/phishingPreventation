Tell them to calm down.  I'm going to start clearing amro, tfs, and carr tra=
des through them as well.  I will do a new xpit to offset some of the new po=
sitions that will lower the margin in the short term.

John - a lot of trades other than energy trades were xpitted to Fimat on Fri=
day from ABN.  Fimat NY  is now upset and wants to restrict our trading with=
 Fimat from 20 million to 11 million.  Do you know who asked for this xpitti=
ng to be done?  Sarah
