Stewart,

	I went over Murray's spreadsheet for the CDWR allocation and found some num=
bers that don't make since to me. I will talk to Murray the moment he walks =
in the door and get this e-mail to CDWR before 9:00am. There is an adjustmen=
t made to the multiplier for CDWR that is specific to only them as a counter=
party.
