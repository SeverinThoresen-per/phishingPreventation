FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be c=
ertain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list o=
f authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to hav=
e approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on =
EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If no=
t, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC=
 team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support=
 from me. =20

Hope that all is well.  --Sally=20

Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received autho=
rization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (J=
ohn Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to =
get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he d=
oes) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Frank
