As you are now aware, the United Way Campaign has now kicked-off and RAC is =
very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and=
 will be taking place.  First of all, Monday morning, each of you should hav=
e received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United =
Way activities for the week.  The building blocks symbolize Enron's commitme=
nt to "Building Houston's Future" with the United Way and the schedule outli=
nes the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show s=
upport for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community.

To highlight this week's activities:

On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in =
the 2001 Enron Days of Caring.  The Enron Corporate Team, of which RAC is a =
large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Communi=
ty Center.  If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity-=
-thank you.  If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like =
to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinato=
rs--Cindy Hudler, Rebecca Phillips, Darren Vanek, Shelli Smith, Becky Caudle=
, Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider.

On Friday, August 10, Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park =
which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to =
celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week.  Included in this event wi=
ll be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around En=
ron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team.  Please p=
lan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.

Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need th=
at the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.  This year h=
as been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the=
 Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison.  In addition to providing their =
typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a cru=
cial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected=
 by the storm.  A contribution to the United Way this year is as important a=
s ever given the extraordinary need.  Remember approximately $0.90 out of ev=
ery $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens =
in the Houston area.  I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective o=
f 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution=
=2E  Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources webs=
ite at https://hrglobal.enron.com.

Thanks for your support.=20

Best regards,

Rick
