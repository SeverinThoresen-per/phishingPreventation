Weekly
Review
In this week's round-up <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=3DhMSR0DERS=
w0CjE0bNX0Au> of economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise=
 risk management perspective: global rate cuts boost markets, but economic n=
ews continues to be gloomy; Enron faces takeover by competitor; the strange =
case of the mystery credit crunch; tough times for the mortgage industry; le=
gal action continues over World Trade Center claims. =09
Analysis=20
The massive scale of claims arising from September 11 has worried many in th=
e P&C insurance market, but harder rates should benefit those who are strong=
 enough to take advantage of them. In this week's analysis <http://email.eRi=
sks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=3DhMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNY0Av>, we look at how Lloyd's of =
London is struggling to convince rating agencies and insurance regulators th=
at it is sufficiently solvent to bounce back from its World Trade Center los=
ses and to benefit from a stronger market.
