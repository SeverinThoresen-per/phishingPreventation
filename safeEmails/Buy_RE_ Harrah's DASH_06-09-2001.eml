I agree. Given that Andy's world is expanding (corp dev) he may be even less=
 accessible. I'll discuss with Andy and Ben. Rick

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to =
sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't i=
n. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen,=
 Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't=
 been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back t=
omorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate=
 through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for appr=
ovals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Frida=
y.
