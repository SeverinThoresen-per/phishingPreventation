FYI......I have talked to Sandi a couple of times, but it is hard to get thr=
ough to anyone in the legal department.....today I decided to send the below=
 attached email....which contains some history.....I am constrained by the l=
egal code of ethics from calling client's who are represented by counsel....=
=2Eso I suggest again that you Tom give another "soft shout" to Ed to see ho=
w we can resolve this quickly, since the lawyers seem to be extremely busy w=
ith other matters.....this is probably much higher on our  priority list tha=
n theirs, especially in light of who is on top while nothing is happening.  =
 Please consider this an update on what's happening in response to you voice=
 mails....call if you have any suggestions... Sincere regards   bng

George,
I have the following questions/comments on the list of ENA contracts to Go t=
o HPL:

Are we sure the following are meant to go?
There is a firm Storage k on Centana#96019236
Firm and IT transport on PG&E Texas Pipeline--#96006479;#96041725;#96041930
Gathering/transport agreement with Blue Dolphin-#96032498

Could you tell me what business is attached to the Alltrade contract #960585=
35? My notes indicate that is the Subscription Agreement for electronic trad=
ing and the actual deal with Alltrade that needs to go is under the GTC #960=
16597--let me know

The St Mary's contract # is terminated in the system #96029825--what's been =
flowing on this one?

Does the Ferguson Inter Vivos Trust agreement go? I know we took it off the =
Mat K list , but my notes indicate this K was terminated and the ENA busines=
s has been done on a GTC  with another entity--can you give some clarificati=
on?

Can you give me some idea of the business done on the following contracts as=
 the file room has no files for these:
Northern natural/Black Marlin #96020553
Pan Grande Pipeline 96019628
Panola Producing Co, inc #96030049

Finally, note the following:
the ENA-FT Texas contract you list is the same as the TXU contract #96001400
Louis dreyfus contract #96057927 is listed twice
EGPT Texas Pipeline contracts #96006479 and 96041930 are listed as PG&E Texa=
s Pipeline contracts as well

Thanks=20
Sandi
