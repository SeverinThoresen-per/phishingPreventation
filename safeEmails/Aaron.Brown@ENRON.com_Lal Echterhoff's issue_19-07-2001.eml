Robert and Louise:  Reading from the bottom up, here is a string of emails t=
hat determined we would let the provisions of the plan and agreement govern =
Echterhoff's issue.  By the way, some of his assumed facts aren't correct - =
we don't make exceptions regarding the plans because of bad accounting resul=
ts.  Retirement for the stock plan is age 55 with 5 years of service regardl=
ess of whether you retire from Enron with respect to benefit programs.

If you would like to discuss, give me a call.

We are going to have to let the plan rule , however, I think this points out=
 how important it is to always stipulate that the grant agreement rules.  Ei=
ther verbally or in writing, we need to say " generally it is the shorter of=
 the term of the option or 3 years.  This depends on when the grant was made=

I spoke with Pat and he agrees with you Michelle.  He said that the award ag=

The Q&A is not binding -- it clearly states that the plan prevails.  Unfortu=
nately, some people have grants that do not have the 3-year period to exerci=
se, although I understand that most of the more recent grants do have the 3-=
year period.

Pat, let me know if you disagree. =20

OK. So what do we say to these people "plan prevails, Q&A may have been misl=
eading, but tough"?

If Mich tells me that Q&A is not legally binding on us I am fine with above.=
 Since they are leaving us I have no desire to give them more than the plan =
entitles them to, but I am frustrated that we stated 3 years so clearly in Q=
&A.

We don't change the terms of option agreements at Enron because of uncapped =
earnings charges after changes are made.  Caveat seems fine and the provisio=
ns of the plan prevail.

Your position that the general disclaimer on the Q&A of March 8 negated the =
specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock opt=
ions is unacceptable.  If the answer to this specific question, shown below,=
  was that various plans had various periods for exercise, then that should =
have been the answer to the question, not an unequivocal statement that the =
period to exercise is three years.  I, and I am sure many others, made certa=
in critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of n=
o validity.  I would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow a=
ll stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier =
due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant.  I use the term "expi=
ration date" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options ar=
e unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with Enro=
n. =20

With regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the partic=
ular stock option plan and cannot be changed, anything can be changed or spe=
cial provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a mer=
ger, spin off or sale of a company.  Special provisions were made to exclude=
 HPL employees from the new all employee stock option plan, special provisio=
ns were made to provide a 5% payment to HPL employees in lieu of the new sto=
ck option plan, special provisions were made to consider HPL employees over =
the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow ves=
ting of stock options and I feel sure that there have been other special con=
siderations to certain employees.

"1.	With the transfer to AEP, will my termination be listed as involuntary s=

Yes, your transfer to AEP will be treated as an involuntary termination by r=

 2.	What is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options?=20
 The period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination, retirem=

Subject:	STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS=20


	We have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration da=
te for stock options.  The Q&A dated March 8, 2001 stated three years as the=
 	exercise date for options.  However,  on page 1 of the document, a stateme=
nt was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock=20
	option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program=
=2E =20

	If you have options listed on the stock option termination report which lis=
t a one year expiration, not three years as stated in question # 16 of the d=
ocument, this is 	correct and follows the provision of the plan document.  S=
ome employees have options granted under a DIFFERENT stock option plan and t=
hat plan carries
	a three year term of expiration.  Please review your report carefully to de=
termine which plan your options were issued under.

	Additionally, the document was intended to provide general information only=
=2E  Page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically =
in case
 	there were any errors made in the document.  Additionally, we stated that =
employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review.  Enron =
provides
	the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the pl=
an and make decisions based on plan document.

	I apologize for any confusion this may have caused, however, the plan under=
 which the options were granted is the official document by which Enron dete=
rmines=20
	the termination date.  Please call me if you need to discuss your options, =
however, understand that I cannot speak with you regarding other employees' =
	compensation/options.
