Jeff,
Do you really think California is having an energy "crisis," or do you think
PG&E is just trying to gouge its customers?  Any light you can shine on this
matter would be appreciated.  I need some facts to back up my usual ranting
and raving on the subject.

Thanks,
Cristina

(Merry Christmas, by the way)
