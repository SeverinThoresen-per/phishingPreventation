David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing wit=
h=20
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them=20
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that=
=20
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a =
3=20
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes=20
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's sinc=
e=20
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you=20
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their=20
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol
