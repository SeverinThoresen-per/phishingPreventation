Group,
Recently we have had problems with the Scheduling Activity Report.  In=20
speaking with Will Smith, it is important that we include the appropriate=20
date, the correct regions, the ST-Whourly desk, and the correct group (24=20
inc).  Without an entry in the desk field, this report is guaranteed to take=
=20
25-30 minutes to run!  Obviously not all deals will pull in (deals under=20
ST-Cali, ST-Bom, or ST-Services) when our desk is specified.  It is STILL th=
e=20
responsibility of the trader running the report to "tie out" the total dolla=
r=20
amount (not mw) to the inc and service sheets, exactly.  A detailed=20
explanantion of a deviation in this dollar amount is expected (ie. extra=20
revenue is a result of congestion, or extra revenue is a result of purchases=
=20
from imbalance at zero...etc.).  If you have any questions on this report or=
=20
any other daily task.  Please let me know.=20

Thank you,
B Williams
