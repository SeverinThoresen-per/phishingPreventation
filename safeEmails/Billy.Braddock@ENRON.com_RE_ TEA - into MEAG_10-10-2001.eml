TEA is ok with allowing hourly scheduling from either internal units or to t=
he border, as long as Enron is handling all scheduling and tags and gives su=
fficient notice for schedule changes.  I assured him that we would handle th=
ose functions.  So, we need to offer for:=20
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources, but we will deliver =
into-GTC border hourly.

TEA will let us go hourly 5 times per month and change the source if we go h=
ourly, as long as the source remains a unit on the Ga-ITS.  However, he does=
n't want a full 50MW block in the June-Sept period, just 40MW.  The 40MW is =
actually already at the high end of his range (needs 30-40MW for June-Sep).

Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if=
 we go hourly.   This essentially would require they provide parking and len=
ding for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.   Can we at least g=
et a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?

An offer from any Scherer unit(s) would work.  He understands the odd lot wi=
ll demand a premium, but I can't talk him into a round 50MW.  So, 2 pieces o=
f energy:=20
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot=
 would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we use=
d Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmis=
sion would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to b=
uy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to off=
er into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or inter=
face would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use h=
is network transmission). =20

Any interest?=20
