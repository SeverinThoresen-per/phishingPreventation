I spoke with Raju Dattani in our London office - and sent her over the langu=
age. She will look at it and see if it is what they use and if she can confi=
rm the location in Platts.

I'll let you know what she says.

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - sma=
ll, but our office's first yen based crude transaction! =20

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  =
ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) mo=
ving forward so we need a master agreement in place. =20

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would =
work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that =
it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001. =20

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, =
Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan =
Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went w=
ell and to see you in May.
