Good morning,

I'd love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project =
that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him? This morning I am kinda unde=
r some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I reall=
y don't have much spare time right now. JA would flip out if I left for coff=
ee now. Maybe later this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? Anyhow, another rid=
e sounds really cool. I had lots of fun. And yes, it would be cooler if I di=
dn't have to worry about work. Let me know when you have extra time to go fo=
r a ride.
My weekend was pretty fun. I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the f=
irst time. It looks so bad. I so don't know anything about lawn care. Also I=
 planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy=
, but it s worth a try. Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard. It's pretty cool=
=2E I bought some step-in switch boots, too. Cool, eh?=20
So I'll talk to you later. Have a great day.
