Still concerned about this, so please give me one more shot.  I think it wou=
ld be useful for NBPL to know about this project for the following reasons:

They already know generally what we're up to.

NBPL is looking at a lateral off Midwestern (their recent acquisition) acros=
s similar territory.

Apparently they have contacted certain potential shippers in the area.

Working "together" could add value to our effort, and it would preclude the =
possibility of two Enron companies contacting the same parties and stumbling=
 over each other.

Some or much of the gas in the acquired PL could be sourced off Midwestern.

Therefore, I'm uncomfortable going forward without some sort of understandin=
g with NBPL.  How about a simple confidentiality agreement, and in addition =
I can write a memo to NBPL that states how NNG would like to proceed with th=
e project (something like the points below).  I realize that we cannot preve=
nt NBPL from doing anything it wants to unless we make them more of a partne=
r in the new PL, which we do not want to do at this time.

Let me know what you think.  I'm going forward on the project development re=
gardless, but do want to deal with NBPL appropriately.

As we discussed, please pass this to Tony.  The following points included wi=
th confidentiality language should fit the bill.  Thanks.


NNG/NBPL Confidentiality Agreement and MOU

Describe project and BP pipelines (SSL, Woodriver - LaPlata).

Conversion of oil and product lines to natural gas service.

Targeting new markets - be general.

Anticipate interconnect with Midwestern PL as well as other pipelines.

Cooperate in the development of target markets, although each party is respo=
nsible for its respective pipeline.

NNG intends to purchase the BP pipelines.

A separate rate structure will be established for the purchased assets.

After conversion and service commencement, and for a period of 6 months, NNG=
 agrees to negotiate exclusively with NBPL for the sale of NNG's pipeline sy=
stem to NBPL.  Neither party is obligated to complete a transaction.
