Carol:

Regarding a "hedge fund meeting" next week, I have spoken with most of the=20
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you=20
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you=20
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming "process" issue.  I also believe that=20
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussio=
n=20
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are=20
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observation=
s=20
are that all hedge funds need not be "last minute" deals, Caroline can be ou=
r=20
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal=20
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is=20
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?
