Hey Vik,

What is going on over there? Are you guys busy?=20

I got a favor to ask you. I know that one time you told me you could talk to=
 your sister about a job opportunity at the World Bank. I am desperate to fi=
nd another job and I feel I am a good candidate to work for the World Bank. =
Can you talk to her about me?  I can call her too and talk about openings th=
ere.

I would really appreciate your help,
Monika
