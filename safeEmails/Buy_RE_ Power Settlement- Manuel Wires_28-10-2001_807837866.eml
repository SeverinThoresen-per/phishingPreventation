Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he man=
ages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critic=
al issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustrati=
on with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that =
my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware=
 of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally=20

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding m=
anual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great=
 deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediate=
ly in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the c=
orrect net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant En=
ergy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we wer=
e not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  Thi=
s resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  T=
he management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate=
 information, in order to manage our daily cash position. =20

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made. =20

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,
