Russell:
I will draft something up later today for you  to look at.  With respect to=20
Richardson Products, the July 29, 1999 Guaranty in the second paragraph=20
already picks up all ECT affiliates which would include HPL, such that any=20
physical contract between ECT or its affiliates and Richardson Products II,=20
Ltd. would already be covered.  Their letter mentions an April 28th=20
Guaranty.  Does one exist?

Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th=
=20
Guaranty, it certainly wouldn't hurt for them to simply send us a letter=20
referencing this Guaranty and stating that it is their understanding that th=
e=20
term "ECT Affiliates" as used in the Guaranty  includes Houston Pipe Line=20
Company.
