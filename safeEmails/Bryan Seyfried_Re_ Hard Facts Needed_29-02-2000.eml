Bryan -=20

In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the=20
non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in=20
Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a=20
variety of people.

I suggest choosing the reference credits for online trading from the already=
=20
approved reference credits which appear on EnronCredit.com.  My recollection=
=20
is that there currently is not a separate approval process from either a=20
credit or legal perspective.  Let's review everything for EOL prior to the=20
states getting to the office on Monday and get an email out with the list of=
=20
reference credits.

New reference entities - as with any other new Products, should be submitted=
=20
to the Product Control Group (Amita Gosalia).

The PCG will then be responsible for the text of the new Products and=20
obtaining the necessary approvals.

However, in accordance with our discussions with Bryan, EnronOnline will be=20
limited to 20 reference entities until after we have settled on the credit=20
derivatives update/volume requirements, which may or may not feed into a=20
phase 2 development of the EnronOnline site.

Paul:

Will there be a different process for approving names as references on=20
EnronCredit.com (non web-trading) and EOL?

Furthermore, you, Edmund, Tomas  and I need to establish a process fro=20
regular and smooth approval of new reference names, a checklist if you will.

Meet this afternoon, before you depart?
