Don't know what works best with your schedule.  Ernie Pitterelli (head of Op=
eratins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the =
things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calc=
ulation of P&L.  Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, =
so it could be helpful for you to be here.  What was Wes' response?  --Sally=

 she was coming down on Monday and Tuesday to discuss settlements and risk. =
 Do you think I should plan on being here for that also?
