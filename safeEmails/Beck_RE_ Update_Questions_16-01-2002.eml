1)  I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the=
 logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.  Please=
 coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of re=
placing Daren. =20

2)  I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.  He is on t=
he current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational =
Databases (part of the Documentation team).  It is correct that his name is =
on the list that I provided to you yesterday. =20

Let me know if you have any other questions.  --Sally=20

Sally -

I have 2 questions from the list that you provided this evening.

1.  Daren Farmer is on the list for Gas Logistics.  Jeanie advised that Dare=
n resigned and his last day is Friday.  Need a replacement.

2.  Israel Estrada is on the list for Documentation, however, he is no longe=
r showing in our database.  Do we need to add back?

Thanks again!
Amy
