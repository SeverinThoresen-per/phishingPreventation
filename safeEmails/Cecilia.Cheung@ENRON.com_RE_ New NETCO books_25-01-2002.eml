Haven't heard back from you all regarding the Canadian P/B/I books for Centr=

 you got the request from Kam or Phillip on this?  If so, would you email me=
 the request together with the CP IDs in Global?  If not, please send John t=
he book request (book code cannot be MC, please assign something else).

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that =
the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I b=
elieve I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT=
-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian=
 book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (oth=
erwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last=
 time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot o=
f FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup. =
=20

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 1=
66859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasda=
ily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another b=
ook code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the orig=

e set up in Tagg/Erms.

Thanks,
Cecilia
