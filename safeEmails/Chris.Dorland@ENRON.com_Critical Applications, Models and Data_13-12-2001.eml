Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested =
that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolid=
ate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I =
don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that =
these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Tra=
ding group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each gr=
oup did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one pe=
rson in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any=
 ?'s/

Thanx=20

Chris
