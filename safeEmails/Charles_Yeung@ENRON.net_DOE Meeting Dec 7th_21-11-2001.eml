Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA m=
embers in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a whol=
esale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I h=
ave been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale =
electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presen=
tation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on=
 behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC sh=
owdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which i=
ncludes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating muc=
h fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may b=
e able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is impora=
tant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/=
infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building proc=
ess.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose i=
ts biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someon=
e on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outco=
me of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC =
approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available =
Monday, Wed, and Fri.=20
