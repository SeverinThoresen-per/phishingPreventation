I would like to add some questions to the ones Dave has raised below.

1.  Would it make a difference if we were transacting Metals in a separate=20
web site from EOL?   I would see this as EnronMetals (the new name for MG)=20
running there own site issuing their own products.  I think we would need=20
this because we would be unable have an EnronOnline entity issuing LME=20
contracts with a sleeving arrangement to EnronMetals/MG.  My understanding i=
s=20
that only a registered entity can issue LME Contracts.

2.  If we had to go to the separate site to address this issue, how would we=
=20
handle the links to EOL?  I assume people on EnronMetals could not trade=20
other products (ngas) on EnronMetals site.  Could we have a click through? =20
Would they have to sign in again?

As you know, we are looking at doing the following with MG:

1) Moving the Market Maker Application into EnronOnline - effectively, by=20
putting the same products on EnronOnline as are currently on Market Maker,=20
then shutting down Market Maker and putting a hyperlink in to EnronOnline

2) Launching financial metals products on EnronOnline, which would transacte=
d=20
by MG.


I have some concerns about both of these activities.


(1) Until today, I did not realise that the Market Maker application actuall=
y=20
involves the transaction of an LME contract. In other words, when a customer=
=20
buys from MG on the Market Maker app, they are buying LME contracts. We have=
=20
taken pains to distinguish between what we do on EnronOnline - which is to=20
transact on products which might settle against a published price vs.=20
transacting on the actual exchange contract.  As you know, Exchange contract=
s=20
are subject to a different set of regulations and scrutiny than currently=20
applies to EnronOnline.


(2) Because MG trades Exchange contracts on the floor of the exchange, they=20
are subject to more stringent regulations than Enron. I am concerned that if=
=20
MG is transacting financial products on EnronOnline, that EnronOnline could=20
come under greater scrutiny by the SFA. Paul: Can you comment on whether or=20
not this is a risk?  If this is a risk, would it be mitigated by having=20
another Enron company handle EnronOnline transactions (with sleeving back to=
=20
MG), or are we already sunk by virtue of the fact that MG is now in the Enro=
n=20
family?

Comments from any/all recipients invited . . .

Thanks,
