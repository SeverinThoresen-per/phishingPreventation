The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten th=
e=20

include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is=20
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather=20
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could=20
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used=

The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would=20
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.
