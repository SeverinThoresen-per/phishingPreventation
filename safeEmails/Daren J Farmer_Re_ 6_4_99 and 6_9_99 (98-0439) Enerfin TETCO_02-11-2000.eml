Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out abou=
t=20
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up an=
d=20
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was i=
n=20
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so=20
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let=20
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.

Please get with the East Desk on this.  If they agree, we can roll the deal.

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extende=
d=20
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume=20
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks
