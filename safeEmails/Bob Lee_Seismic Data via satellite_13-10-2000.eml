I am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a=20
background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will=20
circulate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.

Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in=20
the Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info=
=20
on this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not=20
continued to do this, etc.

Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep=20
water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep se=
a=20
drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make=
=20
these kinds of projects viable financially?
