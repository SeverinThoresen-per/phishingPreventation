Mike,

I have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims.=
  I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not =
comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.

I will send you a new waiver form to use.    The one you are using is not va=
lid under the ADEA.

Michelle
