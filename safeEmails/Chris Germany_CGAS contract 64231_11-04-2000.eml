This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has=
=20
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000=
=20
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand=20
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discus=
s=20
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.
