Jim-

I want to thank you for taking some time to speak with me this morning about=
 my current position relative to Enron's market position.  More importantly,=
 I want to thank you for your candor and honesty.  I walked away from the me=
eting feeling elated and confident, regardless of the bleak message.  =20

I only wish you the best of luck these next few weeks.  You are in a tough p=
osition, a position I do not envy.  I am heeding your advice and looking for=
 opportunities outside this organization.  I had hoped to work in your group=
 as an associate rotation.  I am certain that I could have learned a great d=
eal from you and parlayed it into opportunities for this organization.  Mayb=
e our paths will cross in the future.=20

If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.=
  My cell phone number is 713.444.8282 and work extension is 51793. =20

Yours Sincerely,

Amanda Day

PS.  Please forgive me for calling you "Jeff" earlier.  I did not realize my=
 grave mistake until I hit the elevators.  At least you, hopefully, got a ch=
uckle out of it. =20
