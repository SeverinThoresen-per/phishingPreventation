I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of M=
ariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and f=
eel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my=
 group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If Dave does not have an=
 interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issu=
es I will proceed. Thanks, Rick
