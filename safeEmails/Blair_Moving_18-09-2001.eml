	Since we are all moving at different times, we have declared this week to b=

	The more we clean out now, the easier it will be to move to our final desti=
nation.

	We appreciate everyone's efforts to accomodate the move as best we can.
	Please let Donna, Sheila, Rick, Steve, Brad or I know if you have any quest=
ions.


	Thanks. Lynn
