Just a note to tell each of you that I appreciate your efforts today in our=20
lengthy meeting.  I think you all were very professional, and you all asked=20
the right questions of each other.  I was very proud of the level of=20
performance I saw today, and think this group has strengthened over the last=
=20
six months, which was one of our goals.  The challenges today were healthy=20
and with merit.  I realize it is a difficult process, but I appreciate your=20
patience to work through the process.  I know each of you realize the=20
importance of our building a strong team, as we are only as strong as our=20
people.  We are required to identify strengths and weaknesses to help the=20
employee become stronger.  Enron is the best, and we are obligated to build=20
the very best teams to ensure we deliver the very best services.  If we do=20
not, we all fail.

Good job, today.  Once again, thank you.
