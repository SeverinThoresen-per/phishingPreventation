Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. ("OEI") management team ove=
r the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as w=
ell as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including t=
he operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron=
 systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divid=
ed it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in=
 North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will=
 evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services.=20
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the =
period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this=
 gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cyc=
le to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contra=
ct to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001.=20
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with=
 OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre P=
ipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity.=20
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production=
 companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels =
of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and de=
epwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-conti=
nent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions.=20
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blo=
cks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million =
in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries a=
nd additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will in=
clude continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nan=
sen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery=
 on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drill=
ing of its inventory of core shelf holdings.=20
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five op=
erating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and =
East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from=
 its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential explorat=
ion prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and th=
e Permian Basin.=20
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the ma=
jority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due dilige=
nce on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead des=
k and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas pack=
ages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the ga=
s available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing refere=
nce point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportu=
nity, please contact me at X-36784.=20
