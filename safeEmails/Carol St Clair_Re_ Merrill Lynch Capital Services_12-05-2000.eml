According to Bruce Mills in our group,

We have contacted Merrill Lynch Captial Services to retrieve our outstanding=
=20
confirms.

They have indicated that they want the fixed price (nymex) language changed=20
to reflect
"floating" price language and wants all deals which we are confirming change=
d=20
immediately
and refaxed to them.

Please advise,
