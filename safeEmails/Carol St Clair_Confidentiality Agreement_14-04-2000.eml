Paul:
I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him. =20
What we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a cop=
y=20
of which I have attached).  We can either (1) do a new CA based on this form=
=20
or (2) since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that=
=20
provides that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project=20
that is currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae=
=20
in with you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989=
=2E

Carol
