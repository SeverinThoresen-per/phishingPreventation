Kevin,

Currently, we do not have delivery points established for PJM West or Ontari=
o.  Will these be primary points or will they be dependent upon another curv=
e?! =20

Also, I just want to ensure that there have been no revisions to what you pr=
eviously passed on regarding gas trading - only you and the desk heads (you,=
 Dana, Fletch, Rogers, Harry and Doug).  I have set up gas price books alrea=
dy and I am in the process of setting up Gas Daily books (basis and index) f=
or those mentioned.  Any additions/deletions/corrections?!

Thanks for the input.
Casey
