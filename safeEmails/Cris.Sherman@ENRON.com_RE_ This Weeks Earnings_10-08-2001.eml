AA has concurred with MTM accounting for the South America commodity transac=
tions, so long as they have MTM attributes (which is no different of a stand=
ard than any other bus unit). They would, however, like to update their gene=
ral knowledge of the South American regulatory and commercial environment, e=
tc.  Do we have some presentation materials already done that would be helpf=
ul in this regard? Again, as expected, we are a "go" for MTM.=20

Jody and Cris,

I became aware of the Duke deal late Monday.  Spent yesterday validating the=
ir assumptions and value which is no where near US$15.6. The MTM value looks=
 like it will be around US$4MM.  We plan to finalized the MTM today. Remi wa=
s initially planning to prudence some of the value (with Lavo's approval).  =
However, that was before we added the Pis/Cofins tax assumptions.  Duke did =
pay us a R$15MM option premium on the deal.   Robin Veariel confirmed that E=
CE received that money yesterday.  Spoke with Paul Radous in credit and he i=
s not taking a credit reserve because we are supposed to receive a parental =
guarantee.

I'll keep you posted.

Also, thanks for the message regarding the MTM.  I passed it on to Stacey. =20

Martha -- do you know where $15.6 for the Duke deal is coming from? =20

Chris/Jeff -- Have you seen anything on the Duke deal yet?

I'd prefer not to put big #s on the hotlist until you guys are semi-comforta=
ble with the deal.

Chris, thanks for the reply regarding Andersen and S.A. trading.  Let me kno=
w when you hear back from them.

Thanks,
Jody

Gents,

Lots of "noise" on what should be booked fot the Duke deal on this weeks Hot=
 List (actually a done deal now).  A "little bird" told me that it could be =
as high as $15.6 MM.  Well, I do not buy it.

Before sending out the forecast this week I want to talk to you guys about w=
hat is inside the number we book for Duke.  I will be getting prepared on th=
is end.

Thanks,

Kish
