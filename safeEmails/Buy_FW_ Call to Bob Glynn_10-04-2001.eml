Subject:	Call to Bob Glynn

Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with=
 Glynn:

Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing incl=
uded a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently =
not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, howe=
ver.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our=
 negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may=
 want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectati=
on that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in th=
e April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an oppo=
rtunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the val=
idity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity =
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several=
 reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, =
2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of =
the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as signi=
ficant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... an=
d PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the c=
reditors committee anyway).
