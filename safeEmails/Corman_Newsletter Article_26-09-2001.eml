Jackie,

Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:

Children's Church Update

A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sunda=
ys) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of th=
e regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's ch=
urch after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal need=
s before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.

The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years t=
hrough 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are lea=
rning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship =
-- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to mak=
e a prayer sandwich!


Thanks
Shelley
