Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from En=
ron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until to=
day.  I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that t=
he file be saved first before opening.  Did that, and what comes up looks li=
ke it is in tongues!!!  Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully =
Nancy was able to review it. =20

I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at th=
e board meeting is still in my NCL folder.  I meant to retype and get this t=
o you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrifi=
c.  I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had =
very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM l=
ast Tuesday.  Unless Lori got that article to you in another way, we are mis=
sing that from the newsletter! =20

I will call you and if indeed Lori's article is not in there (not the permis=
sion form, but another article), I will contact Sally and I will simply make=
 copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.  S=
orry about this!! =20

Sounds as if you had a busy Thanksgiving on top of a move as well.  Hope tha=
t you are enjoying the new place.  Too bad about the Sooners on Saturday.  D=
avid had thought about driving to Dallas next weekend for the Big 12 Champio=
nship game, but obviously won't be doing that now!  --Sally=20

Dear Nancy, Sally & Janet -

Did you have a wonderful Thanksgiving?  Ours was very nice; Mark's sister,
her husband and 2-year old daughter were here from California, and Mark's mo=
m
& her husband came in from D.C. (but they stayed in a hotel!).  Luckily, our
aunt had the big dinner at her house - no trying to cook among the boxes!

Have you had an opportunity to review the December newsletter?  If so, pleas=
e
let me know of any corrections or changes (Miranda gave me the corrected
minutes).  My plan is to drop it off to Sally Walker for copying first thing
Monday morning.  It will be crazy around here after noon Monday, and the
computer will be off for a few days (Monday night 'til Wednesday night or
Thursday) while we get set up in the new house . . .if the download didn't
work and you need a copy to proof, just let me know and I'll swing by with
one in the morning (our closing is not far from you, Nancy, so it won't be a
problem).

Thanks!  Robin
