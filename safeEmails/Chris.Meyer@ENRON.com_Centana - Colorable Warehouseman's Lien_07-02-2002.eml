Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its clai=
m against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged f=
rom "if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas f=
rom you" to "we are holding the gas till you pay us"  Based on Joe's discuss=
ions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to s=
tored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be:

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / =
colorable warehouseman's lien
       (post petition amounts are already approved);
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st d=
ay order;
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if a=
vailable.

My preference is option (1) as :
	-	option (2) is the most unlikely,=20
	-	option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we contin=
ue to accrue storage costs, and
	-	option (4) holds significant transaction risk.

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Fundin=
g Request ("BFR").

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR=
?

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed wit=
h (1) above?=20
