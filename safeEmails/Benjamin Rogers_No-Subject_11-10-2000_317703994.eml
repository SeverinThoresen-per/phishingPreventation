 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site=20
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday=20
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In=20
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the=20
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and=20
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the=20
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed=
=2E
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take=20
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager. =
=20
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per=20
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling=20
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben
