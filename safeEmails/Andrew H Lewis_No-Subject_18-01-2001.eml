To whom it may concern:

First, why does the Dell public website have more choices for upgrades then=20
the Enron website?  For example, the website available to the public has a=20
19" monitor (M991) for an extra $140.

Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it=20
offers to the general public?  For example, the website available to the=20
public allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor for $290.=
 =20
The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monito=
r=20
for $400.  Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $110 for th=
e=20
same upgrade.

I look forward to your response.
