Okay, now that I have re-read this and understand what Pat is suggesting, th=
e answer is no we (benefits) can't speak to past practices since we were nev=
er part of the past practice.  What I need you to do is assist to make sure =
that the new practice planned that is being applied by Irma Alvarez's group =
is consistent with the plan document.  As you and I have discussed, we need =
to take this in the form of an administrative guideline to the admin. commit=
tee for them to bless as well. =20

The various heads of HR and the legal group who worked with each HR person o=
n severance will have to speak to past practice. =20

As it relates to service, I would like you and Pat to have a discussion abou=
t the break in service rules and the interpretation of the word severance in=
 the plan.  If Pat can't help, try Carol Jewett.   Benefits (and its ERISA a=
ttorney) need to provide the interpretation of the plan document for those t=
hat administer the plan.  We need to do everything possible to help everyone=
 with the development of a tool that accurately calculates the plan benefits=
 per the plan document.  If the document is lacking then we need to fix it (=
ASAP).  I am not a believer in vague language that is subject to multiple in=
terpretations. =20

Thank
Cb

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challeng=

ent work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration be=
cause an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistentl=
y in similar circumstances.  =20
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may =
not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery rela=

I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's grou=
