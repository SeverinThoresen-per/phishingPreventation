This "thread" is from a fella who works in the office next to me who is on
the "other team".  You might want to be careful which night you go to
Tony's...

actually, i might get a group together for that night too.... it would be
interesting to observe how the typical str8 man reacts to being in a
resturant 1/2 full of drunk homosexuals & big lesbians- then realize that
they, themselves, are a table of all men and how that might look..... :)

Men:

Hunting season is over. It is now working season. All email threads are

gone. No one talks to one another. This is wrong.

I therefor propose man night February 28th, 2002 at some location yet
to be
determined, such as Tony's mexican food...on Ella.
