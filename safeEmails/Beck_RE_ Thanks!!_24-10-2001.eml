I am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.  I noticed that the Dea=
n jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".  The Univers=
ity does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you hav=
e not received that. =20

It was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.  Please keep me poste=
d on your plans after graduation. =20
