We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.=

So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.

Katherine,

 This is a brokered deal (Buy Deal 231758 and Sell Deal 93472).  This first=20
day was not pathed, that's why you are missing volume of 271.  Per Carlos=20
(see below) the deal was not for day one.
