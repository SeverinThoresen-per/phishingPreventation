Dear All,=20

        After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will n=
ot be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy =
all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers ton=
ight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Prod=
uction data.

        Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Cur=
ves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

        Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 a=
nd 10:00AM 2/5/2002.=20

        UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.=20

        Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.=20

        Regards,=20


Norman.=20

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position M=
anagers ( Curve) files.=20
