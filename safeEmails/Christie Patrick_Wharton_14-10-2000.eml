Hi Jeff!

I know you received the information below.  Additionally, I have 2 people=20
from Broadband Services meeting us there Friday (one is Traci Warner who set=
=20
up the Rice U deal). Further, I'll be meeting with Amy Briggs regarding the=20
Entrepeneurship Conference Nov 30th and Dec 1st.  I've already spoken with=20
her and Tom Piazze and both independently confirmed as you suspected that we=
=20
committed to sponsor at the $10,000 level.  This entitles us to Banners,=20
panels, posters, and most importantly, a Keynote address.  I'll discuss the=20
keynote address with her but would appreciate your thoughts in advance as to=
=20
how you'd like to see the Keynote speech executed (suggestions for topics,=20
proposed speaking candidates, when in the conference you'd like to see=20
Enron's speech, etc). I'll review the trip with you when we return.

Thanks Jeff!

--Christie.
