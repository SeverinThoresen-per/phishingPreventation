Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best jus=
t to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct r=
eports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can =
only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent=
 two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work=
 just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of t=
ime, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services =
and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants. =20

It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information fo=
r employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbe=
rs are up-to-date. =20

Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough time=
s.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --S=
ally=20

Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and =
"ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and paym=
ents.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their b=
osses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  W=
e should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditure=
s. =20

Greg/Sally,

We have a meeting with ENW Assistants on Monday at lunch.  Agenda topics inc=
lude timesheets (what the different off-duty codes mean, why they should mak=
e sure that employees in their depts. do timesheets, etc.) and back-up proce=
dures during absences.  Marla Barnard will be there as well to answer any HR=
-related questions the assistants may have.

Is there any timely information we can share with regard to spending?

Thanks,

Tina Spiller
