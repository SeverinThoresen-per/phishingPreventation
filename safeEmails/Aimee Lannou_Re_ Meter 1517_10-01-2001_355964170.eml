Daren - After checking with MIPS, you are correct.  Jan. 1 only flowed 19=20
dth.  The 5882 dth was a bad estimate.  A better estimate was received on=20
1/7/00.
Sorry about all the confusion.

Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day=
=20
1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal #=

506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.
