I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Cen=
ter for Houston's Future.  I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a me=
mber of the Forum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many int=
eresting, talented members of the Houston community.  I know that I will enj=
oy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well a=
s collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between=
 now and then.   I especially am excited about the possibilities of making a=
n impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and actio=
n steps  through my association with the Center.   Thanks again for making t=
his opportunity available to me.  --Sally Beck=20
