I met with Peggy Hedstrom and to some extent with Laura Scott  in Calgary re=
garding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer outsourcin=
g deals.


The producer provides to EC their projected production schedule for the year=
 by month by plant outlet. This information is entered into Sitara by EC on =
a single ticket with no meter information. For the prompt month EC confirms =
back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day. This=
 includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their dai=
ly flows. This information is contained within a Excel spreadsheet which can=
 be viewed by the producer via a common network drive.

The producer communicates to EC their sales for the month and on a daily bas=
is. EC enters these trades in Sitara. The Sitara position by producer is bal=
anced to zero daily. The producer does not have access to Sitara.

EC acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer. They h=
ave no diversion rights on this transport, it is utilised at the direction o=
f the producer. EC nominates producers transport. All transport expense esti=
mates are maintained by EC. EC is invoiced and pays the pipeline.

EC monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by Nov=
a. It is the responsibility of EC to inform the producer of significant vari=
ances in their scheduled versus estimated flows. Nova requires that shippers=
 be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out of tole=
rance. It is EC's responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty situati=
ons. The producer, at the direction of EC, either sells or buys on an intrad=
ay basis to balance their position on the pipeline. Final estimated flows ar=
e then downloaded by EC into the Excel spreadsheet. This final estimate is t=
han used as the expected volume for the upcoming day.  And Sitara is updated=
 accordingly.

At months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting sy=
stem referred to as Solomon. Actual volumes as provided by the pipeline are =
also entered into the system for settlement. I didn't have a lot of time to =
devote to the accounting process, but I doubt ENA would take this approach.

EC utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics an=
d origination standpoint. Peggy said they did not hire people specifically f=
rom the producer/customers but did seek out people with extensive producer e=
xperience to assist with these customers. Peggy feels that their success is =
due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed wit=
h their customers through this point of contact approach.

It is of note that Unify is not utilised in managing these customers busines=
s. Peggy feels that Unify is not  designed to handle it and response time is=
 too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are working und=
er on a daily basis.
