EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreem=
ent committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rat=
es above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes=
 above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for tra=
nsport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final d=
etermination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI =
commitment.


Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checke=
d the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the =
prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made. =20
