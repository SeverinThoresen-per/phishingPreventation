Darren,

I received another invoice for September production for Blue Dolphin.  Are w=
e responsible for transportation fees for September and future production mo=
nths?  Also, do the dehydration fees (MEI) apply to AEP as well? Currently, =
the August invoices have not been paid. If ENA Upstream is not responsible, =
let me know who/where I should forward the invoices.

We have no activity with Blue Dolphin.  This has got to be AEP, old HPL busi=
ness.
