Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant in=
crease in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with in=
creased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.   =
 Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday:=
 In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting t=
o creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What=
 is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's infl=
ow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
