Instead of sending us a 1-paragraph extension letter Wed night, Allegheny se=
nt a one-sided 4-pager yesterday afternoon.

The tone of the letter was inappropriate (Las Vegas agreeing it was in defau=
lt, but AESC being kind enough to give us a chance).  Also, the business poi=
nts were overeaching and/or vague.
