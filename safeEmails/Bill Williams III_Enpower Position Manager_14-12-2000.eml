Group,

As you are all well aware, we must be flat in enpower and caps position=20
manager at the beginning and end of each shift.  This is extremely important=
=20
for ourselves and other groups on the floor.
Since Friday, we have been flat in position manager only 2 out of 5 times at=
=20
8 in the morning the following day.  On Monday, Risk could not run its=20
reports until AFTER noon.  On Tuesday, we delayed the entire floor again. =20
And on Thursday, Risk ran its reports based on information from RT that we=20
were flat for the 13th.  We were not flat and I did not know of the problem=20
until preschedulers brought it to the floors attention.  This is not good.

Over the past week we have experienced numerous complex cuts and many member=
s=20
of the group have put in long hours and worked diligently to try to balance=20
these cuts out.  I recognize and appreciate this hard work.  However, at the=
=20
end of the day we must be flat.  If you have questions, it is your=20
responsibility to ask.  I do not want to call group members back in after=20
their shift is over if we are not flat, but I will have little other choice=20
if this continues.=20
