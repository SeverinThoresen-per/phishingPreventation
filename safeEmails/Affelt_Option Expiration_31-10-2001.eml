Mr. Lay-

I am a long-term Enron employee and have shared your vision of building Enro=
n for over 10 years.  It has been exciting being a part of building the Worl=
d's Largest Energy Company.   I am concerned about the short term turn of ev=
ents at Enron but still feel loyal and committed to Enron and your vision.  =
 Unfortunately, my passion to follow your vision has led me to keep the many=
 stock options I have accumulated over the years instead of "cashing out".  =
 I am now faced with options that not only are "under water" but also some w=
ill expire as soon as January 2002.  I know it is not possible to reset the =
option price.  However, is it possible to extend the option expiration date =
on these options a few years?  I believe Enron will eventually rebound and I=
 still believe in your vision but I also believe it will be a while before w=
e can recapture the confidence of the markets.=20

Thanks and keep the faith.


Scott Affelt
