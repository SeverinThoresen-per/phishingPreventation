Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  =
I=20
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brend=
a=20
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99. =
=20
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial=20
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If i=
t=20
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment t=
o=20
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl,=20

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas=20
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most=
=20
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be=20
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let m=
e=20
know if you need something like that. =20

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come u=
p=20
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas of=
f=20
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P

D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes=20
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing=20
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him=20
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the=20
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you=20
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for=20
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA &=
=20
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to=20
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is=
=20
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity=
=20
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will=20
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up i=
n=20
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the ga=
s=20
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  -- =20
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how som=
e=20
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any=20
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.
