Chris - did you ask Kate who helped with the Bug deal.  Even if they are not=
=20
the ones for CES, at least they could be at the meeting and help us iron out=
=20
the issues we will face here.  Please let me know.

Also, a side note:  we received the proxy schedule from Melissa, but I'm=20
curious if you all have discussed the ending balance for March.  Out of=20
curiousity, are they withdrawing right now?  Are they near their required=20
minimums or well below?   We need to verify all of this so that we know what=
=20
we're working with when we start doing storage for our own account and use.

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like=20
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several=20
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and=20
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection=20
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal=20
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what=20
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know ho=
w=20
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?
