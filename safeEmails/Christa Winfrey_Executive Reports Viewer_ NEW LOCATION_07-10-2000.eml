As of midnight, Saturday, October 7th, the Executive Reports Viewer will no=20
longer be accessible at its current location, due to IT modifications.  The=20
system has been redesigned to allow access via Internet Explorer (you cannot=
=20
use Netscape).  The new location is http://ersys.corp.enron.com.=20
This change will ONLY affect the viewing of the reports; it will NOT impact=20
the publishing of the reports.

A shortcut icon can be created by dragging the Internet Explorer Logo=20
(located in the address field next to the URL) to the desktop.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call Kristin Walsh at=20
3-9510 or myself at 3-9307.

Thank you for your understanding,
Christa Winfrey
