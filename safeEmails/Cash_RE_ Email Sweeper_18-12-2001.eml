Hey there,

I just sent an email outside the Enron firewall that contains the word "sala=
ry" in the attachment.  So I expect it to be picked up in the HR sweeper we =
have activated.  Just thought I'd let you know ahead of time that you may se=
e it and let you know it was an approved mailing. =20

Thanks.
Kathy
