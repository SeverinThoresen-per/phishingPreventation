I was wondering if this would work: =20

Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on=20
spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process. =20

Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty=20
(like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of=
=20
what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a=20
credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry=
=20
and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?

For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to EN=
A=20
at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the=20
commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:
 1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10,=20
Counterparty =3D Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline
 2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10,=20
Counterparty =3D Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd

It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of=20
this transport p&l. =20
Please advise.
