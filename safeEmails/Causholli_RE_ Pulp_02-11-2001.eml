Amy,

You could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capaci=
ty will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let'=
s say other areas of the world. I remember that in the RISI conference the s=
peakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that o=
f Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will =
major pulp buyers.

Anyways, you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website. Let m=
e know because I have some printed copies too.
