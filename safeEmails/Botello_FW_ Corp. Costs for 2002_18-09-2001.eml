	Dawn,
	In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for E=
TS HQ.  It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one=
 column.  We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other =
companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 119=
5, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 hav=
e employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars=
 that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet=
=2E  Thank you for your assistance.  Should you have any questions please ca=
ll.
	Mary
