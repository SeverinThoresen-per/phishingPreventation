Correct....our intent is to err on the side of conservatism with respect to=20
pulling credits off the ok list and then put them back on as and when the=20
legal and commercial due diligence suggests that it is prudent.  It is=20
definately impractical to ask for specific consent from each reference credi=
t=20
as we can probably expect many of the consent docs to make it into the bin. =
=20
I have drafted an initial notification letter and will forward for review=20
tomorrow.   I think that it is so unlikely that cp's will sign and mail back=
=20
a formal consent that we should consider delisting them instead of asking fo=
r=20
consent.  If we are successful in building the business as a standard for=20
price discovery and liquidity, companies will ask us to quote on them. =20

Bradford is taking a final pass through the reference credits and I will=20
forward the pared down list on asap.

Subject: Re: Consent =20

Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet.=
 =20
We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if=20
that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having=20
spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to=20
quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen=20
the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it=20
included people like TXU.

On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send=
=20
them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make=
=20
a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on=20
paper?

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after=20
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference=20
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were=20
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was=
=20
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities=
=20
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each=20
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or=20
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing=20
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of=20
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been=
=20
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is b=
y=20
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet=20
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business=20
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require=20
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to=20
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice=20
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and move=
d=20
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also o=
n=20
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent w=
e=20
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those=20
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them=
=20
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the=20
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference=20
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference=20
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at=
=20
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions=20
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference=20
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial=
=20
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. =20

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits=20
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we=20
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be=
=20
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect tha=
t=20
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small=20
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies=20
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.
