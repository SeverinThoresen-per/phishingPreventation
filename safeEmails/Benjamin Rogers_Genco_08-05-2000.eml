Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp=20
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about=20
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead=20
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them=
,=20
due to our past conversation's regarding generation. =20
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if=
=20
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that=20
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the=20
delivery of the turbines. =20
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation=20
business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".  Also, it=20
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with othe=
r=20
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate=20
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth=20
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as=20
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks! =20
