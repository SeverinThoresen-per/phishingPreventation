Guys,

I gave Louise  a"plan" which consists of trading list, transmission list, ga=
nt chart, org charts and your product descriptions.  I did not include any "=
strategy" or "volume targets" in the plan - my thought is we have a lot of w=
ork to do and we'll get after it.  I told her that the lists are works in pr=
ocess and will be modified or re-formatted since they will become our workin=
g tools for getting this stuff done.  Kevin,  I will be in Houston tomorrow =
if you want to review any of this.  Lists are unlikely to be perfect but the=
y demonstrate that we have spent some time on this and we have a starting po=
int.

Regards,

Chris Calger
