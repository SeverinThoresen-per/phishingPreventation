Hi sweetheart.

I love you.

I enjoyed sitting at the table eating breakfast with you this morning. Every=
 day that I get to be with you is a special gift for me. I love you so much.=

Jorie sent an envelope with Dan for me to give to you. It says on the envelo=
pe that she looked for the house online (ERA.COM) and found it under the 150=
-250 range.=20

I can't wait to see you tonight. I love you baby.

Have a good day.
