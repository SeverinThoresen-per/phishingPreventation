As I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller fo=
r EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the mo=
st significant accomplishments are:

Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business whil=
e strategic systems are developed. =20
	Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have be=
en predominantly automated.  =09
	Financial settlements has been automated.  =09
	Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and sett=
lements.  Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.

People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with t=
he remaining efforts supported by Global Markets.  Today, we have an enthusi=
astic, energetic team of 41 employees.  The team includes our London office =
also.  We continue to recruit for additional positions.

Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to =
ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and=
 settlements.  Some of these tools include:
Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets =
were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were=
 in place.  Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, =
etc. can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.
LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical busi=
ness and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all c=
ommodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG.  This=
 tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the log=
istics/settlements systems to stay in sync.
Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and =
presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to En=
ron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of du=
ties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, T=
ax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.


Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts.  Additionall=
y, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to=
 follow-up with an additional meeting.  I need just a bit more clarity aroun=
d the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role =
and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide wit=
h my personal goals.

If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.

Thanks for your support.  It means alot to me.

Brenda
