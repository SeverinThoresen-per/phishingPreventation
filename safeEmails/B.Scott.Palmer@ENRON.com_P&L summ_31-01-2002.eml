There is a P&L Summary for east desk in the Netco directory located at O:/ER=
MS/erms_adm/Netco/2002/0102/Regions0102/_Converted/East P&L Summ. Please tak=
e a look at it and tell me what you think. To simplify and speed up the repo=
rting process, I added buttons that will link to the P&L's. The format may o=
r may not resemble formats used on other desks, but I do believe the data sh=
own is comprehensive.

Errol - This may not fit your needs on the financial desk. You may need to d=
esign your own. If so, let me know if I can help.=20


Thanks.

Scott
