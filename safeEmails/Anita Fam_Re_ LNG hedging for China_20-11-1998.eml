Hi Mark -

You're right.  Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority=20
to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and
c. foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative=20
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned=20
enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") an=
d=20
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There=20
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into=20
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned=20
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact=20
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oi=
l=20
Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor th=
e=20
authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.

I believe  that Nony has our Legal Survey on PRC on file so you might wish t=
o=20
pass to Cynthia a copy of  the PRC Derivatives Transctions Guide for her to=20
look at.  It's a good snapshot of the issues which are encountered in the PR=
C.

Regards,
Anita
