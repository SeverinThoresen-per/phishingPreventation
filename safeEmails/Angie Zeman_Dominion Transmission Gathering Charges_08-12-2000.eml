Subject: Dominion Transmission Gathering Charges

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CN=
G=20
Transmission)  announced that they have reached a five year agreement on=20
gathering rates.  Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval,=20
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001.  Under the agreement,=20
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for=20
gathering or processing.  Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention=20
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing.  They are:

                                                       1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003 =
 =20
                 7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry                                      =20
0                                                          0
Transmission Wet                                 =20
3.91%                                                  3.51%
Gathering Dry                                          =20
9.34%                                                   9.34%
Gathering Wet                                         =20
13.25%                                               12.85%          =20

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate  th=
e=20
production information to the producer and/or his agent.  My guess is that=20
they will send a  monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each=20
meter.  The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter=20
(a gross volume) .  This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage=
=20
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or=20
processing).  The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer=20
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing.  There will be no=20
additional charges.  ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

John
