Gentlemen -

Following the Dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news," Dabhol is getting=
=20
some good news this week.

As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB=20
purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially=20
misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual=20
ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).  However, the letter=20
goes on to state that MSEB is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement=
=20
of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum." =
=20
We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for=20
clarification.  Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our=20
already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to=
=20
be bound by the PPA.

While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects o=
f=20
the PPA, the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on=20
the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by =
a=20
competent authority."  We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthr=
a=20
Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a "how much should we pay DPC"=20
determination.  If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help=
=20
our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.

DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in=20
May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9=20
days.  While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I=20
believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to=20
give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing=20
project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.
