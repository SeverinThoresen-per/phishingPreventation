So did I. It seems Jim by-passed Presto.

I would really like her on the ground by early July - when I have 2 weeks=20
back here to collect my family & vacate.

Also - she seemed to think that she could spend time 50/50 in the interim.=20

I'm completely aware of how difficult it is to extract ones-self from a job =
-=20
I'm there.

Thoughts?

I heard Kristen was the topic of a discussion between Jim and Presto -=20
re:timing.

Kristen was going to meet with you.

Jim wants real soon - Presto wants never - you know - the regular story.

Let me know if you hear anything.
