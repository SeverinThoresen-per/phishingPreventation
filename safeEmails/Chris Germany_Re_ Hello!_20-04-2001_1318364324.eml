Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very =
wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in Col=
umbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  =
They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  Ho=
pefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan
