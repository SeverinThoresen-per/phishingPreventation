Walton provides a good history of Western transmission organization.  I am p=
assing this along because I thought it may be of interest, perhaps to some o=
f your newer employees.

The history is helpful to putting this in context.

In order to explain who WECC is, I must lay a little historical background. =
 If you will recall, when EPAct'92 was passed, the usual view was that FERC =
could order wheeling, but only on a case by case basis.  There had been an e=
ffort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conferen=
ce committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the West =
at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-implement=
ation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summer of 1=
994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRTA (South=
western Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regional Tran=
smission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open process th=
at included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners, the transm=
ission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regulators.  The I=
PPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric Clearing Hous=
e (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded in November t=
elling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmission access.  In=
stead of collapsing as predicted by the "just say no" crowd, the members acc=
epted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA formed in June of =
1995. =20
=20
While the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the tra=
ditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC issue=
d the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the pa=
rticipants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer of =
1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OASIS.  =
With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work of th=
e RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the interface b=
etween commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was developed=
 in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to be includ=
ed.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized by the RTGs=
 and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to be two?) R=
TOs proposals together.
=20
When the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WSC=
C.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be member=
s.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measures=
=2E  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend, =
so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representation=
=2E  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it ins=
ide WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed se=
parately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to open i=
ts membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning organizat=
ion.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.
=20
Once all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it =
was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functions=
=2E   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly,=
 but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Electri=
c Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA togeth=
er initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as far=
 as NERC is concerned. =20
=20
While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do further=
 open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commerci=
al impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  Does=
 it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play "smash-=
em, bash-em" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in our t=
hinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industry, nev=
er as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to change.  T=
he WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules and open=
s the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to breath s=
ome life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSCC/WRTA/SWR=
TA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate over EISB =
works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.

This is the first I have heard of WECC.  I assume it is a "Western" NERC -ty=
pe organization?=20

 I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about formi=
ng single standards applicable to both the East and West.  They would howeve=
r, like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West its=
elf.  Sounds like WECC may be able to do this. One of the big problems with =
the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating requir=
ements on its members as the East has tried to be.   At NERC, WSCC members h=
ave always argued deference to the West due to system differences.  Unfortun=
ately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization in the We=
st over many transmission access practices, leaving it up to the sub-regions=
 or individual TPs to decide.  I am not saying they are not technically just=
ified, but there has been no incentive to bring about more consistent practi=
ces.

Is WECC consistent with EISB?  It depends, if WECC is sovereign over any oth=
er organization for standards approval, then I would say no.  I think WECC s=
hould be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved thro=
ugh EISB as well.  The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can go =
directly to FERC, then it becomes effectively the same as "deference to the =
West" -type language we have been fighting against. =20

So my verdict on WECC depends.....=20
As I noted in an earlier note, I believe there are those pushing for NERC to=
 continue doing "reliability-only" and establish a contractual relationship =
to coordinate with EISB.  The WECC could take the same approach.  If this sc=
enario plays out, I believe customers will leave NERC and put their money in=
to EISB.  We must then work towards making NERC merely a transmission operat=
ors' advocacy group ( i.e. EEI is transmission owners advocacy group).  They=
 can exist to focus on reliability - but have no direct standards setting au=
thority.  They must be a member of EISB and participate as a member in one o=
f the market sectors.

If anyone has any more info on WECC, please share it.=20

What do we think of FERC's approval of the new WECC this week?  As I underst=
and it from the trade press, this new group is a merger of the WSCC and two =
other groups.  The new entity will handle reliability for RTOs, etc. and oth=
ers in the West.  Is this consistent with our views on reliablity, EISB, etc=
=2E?

Thanks.=20
