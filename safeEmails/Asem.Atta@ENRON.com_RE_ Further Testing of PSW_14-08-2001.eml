Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled Physica=
lAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to =
the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about lo=
cations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Port=
land\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfo=
rtunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself.=20

thanks
