Bob:
As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidentia=
l=20
information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses,=20
memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to=
=20
give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it=20
subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A=20
says and that is why I deleted their language.

With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any=20
director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any=20
party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or=20
representative.

Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in=20
particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the=20
reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a=20
description of what we are showing them?

Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no=20
solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please=20
communicate that to them?
Carol
