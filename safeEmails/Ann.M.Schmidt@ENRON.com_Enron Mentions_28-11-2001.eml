Personal Time/Your Money
Don't Bet It All On Your Employer ; The plunge of Enron stock serves as a wa=
rning that workers should not invest too much in their company

(Copyright 2001)

Steve Lacey, 45, an emergency-repair dispatcher for a utility company in Sal=
em, Ore., has a personal life that reads like a holiday greeting card. He re=
cently married his longtime love, and after packing boxes over Thanksgiving =
weekend, they are set to move into their dream house in the country, just in=
 time for Christmas. Lacey's retirement plans, however, are in ruins. He wor=
ks for the embattled energy-trading firm Enron, and has all his 401(k) savin=
gs in Enron stock, which plunged from $90 a share in late 2000 to $4.71 at t=
he end of last week.=20
Much of that decline has come since October when Enron reported it had lost =
$638 million in the third quarter and later admitted it had overstated earni=
ngs from 1997 to 2000. As their life savings shriveled, all Lacey and his co=
-workers could do was watch. From Oct. 17 to mid-November, Enron blocked its=
 employees from shifting investments in their 401(k) accounts, while it swit=
ched to a new plan administrator.
Lacey has joined a federal lawsuit that accuses Enron of breaching its fiduc=
iary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in Enron stock even aft=
er executives became aware of serious financial problems that would hurt the=
 stock price. "There was a lot of promotion inside the company to invest in =
Enron and help us grow, so everybody got into it," Lacey told TIME's Cathy B=
ooth Thomas. Enron says it doesn't comment on pending lawsuits.=20
Lacey and his colleagues could not have anticipated that they would be stuck=
 with a plummeting stock. But their woes should be seen as a warning not to =
hold too much of your employer's stock in your 401(k) and to regularly monit=
or the diversification of your investments.=20
Like Enron's, many firms' 401(k) plans can have blackout periods lasting fro=
m a few days to a few weeks when they change plan administrators. "That's no=
t necessarily wrong or illegal," says Alden Bianchi, chairman of the employe=
e-benefits group at the Mirick O'Connell law firm in Westborough, Mass. Empl=
oyees need to make sure their 401(k) investments are diversified at all time=
s--in case they can't shift them for a while.=20
Like Enron, many other big firms match employee contributions with company s=
tock. Your allocation to that one investment can grow very quickly. And you =
might not be allowed to reallocate those matching funds into other investmen=
ts until age 50 to 55. At the end of last year, a whopping 39% of total asse=
ts in profit sharing and 401(k) plans were invested in the stock of the spon=
soring company. Among employees who are allowed to hold their employer's sto=
ck in their 401(k) account, 18% invested half or more of their savings in th=
at stock.=20
Financial planners will tell you it's a mistake to bet so much on a single s=
tock--especially that of the company you work for, whose fortunes already af=
fect your job security and career advancement. Planners often advise investo=
rs to hold as little of their employer's stock as they can--say, only the am=
ount the company gives them as a matching contribution. Then they should shi=
ft assets out of even that matching stock into a mix of diversified stock-an=
d-bond mutual funds as soon as they are old enough to do so. Similarly, if y=
our employer gives you options to buy company stock, don't buy and hold the =
stock; cash it in and invest the proceeds in a diverse blend of stocks and b=
onds or mutual funds.=20
Remember that it's your responsibility to arrange your investments so that t=
hey can survive any financial trouble your employer might suffer. As financi=
al planner Clare Wherley of New Providence, N.J., says, "It's not the compan=
y's responsibility to make sure your investments go up."=20

Pick One Stock; Our annual Love Only One stock-picking contest.

Bearish Wall Streeters again dominate our annual Love Only One stock-picking=
 contest. 2002 may not be so easy.=20
Our year-end Love Only One contest invites analysts and money managers to st=
ick their necks out by choosing one stock to buy or to sell short. Those who=
 beat the market over the next 12 months get return invites.
Our 12 bulls, with an 18% average decline, fared somewhat better than the S&=
P500, which fell 20% from Nov. 13, 2000 to Nov. 1, 2001. Not much to write h=
ome about. But it was a great year to finger rotten stocks. Our five bears' =
picks fell an average 56%. Four bears qualified to reenter, and three chose =
to do so.=20
ProFund Advisors' William Seale hit the bull's-eye by selecting Transmeta as=
 a stinker. In the past year the stock has fallen 95%. He's back this year w=
ith a rap on Carnival Corp. Already, one big cruise line, American Classic V=
oyages, has declared bankruptcy. Now Carnival, despite being stronger than m=
ost cruise operators, will suffer as the heavy burden of overhead is spread =
among fewer vacationers, he says. At a recent $23 Carnival is trading at 16 =
times estimated 2002 earnings per share and is eminently shortable.=20
Stephen N. Worthington of Barbary Coast Capital Management foresaw trouble w=
ith the burn rate and debt load at wireless service provider Metricom, tradi=
ng a year ago at $15.75. Nice call. In July 2001 the company filed for Chapt=
er 11 protection.=20
This year Worthington sees trouble brewing on the balance sheet of PacifiCar=
e Health Systems. He cites an impending writeoff of the HMO's intangibles (m=
ostly goodwill), now 42% of assets.=20
Martin Weiner of Comstock Partners correctly anticipated that a sagging mark=
et would dent enthusiasm for stock trading, as he picked broker Charles Schw=
ab, which fell 57%. For 2002, Weiner estimates a 20% drop in capital spendin=
g for the semiconductor industry. So he says you should short Applied Materi=
als, the big supplier of chipmaking equipment.=20
Two new bears sign on for the year ahead: Timothy Ghriskey of Ghriskey Capit=
al Partners and Cengiz Searfoss, portfolio manager at West Broadway Partners=
=2E Ghriskey sees a slide in Nestle, as investors lose their appetite for fo=
od stocks in an eventual market rebound. Searfoss targets Eastman Kodak for =
the stiff competition it confronts in a low-margin business.=20
Now for the bulls. Jean-Marie Eveillard, manager of the First Eagle SoGen Gl=
obal Fund, gained 21% with timber producer Rayonier. For next year Eveillard=
 still likes timber, as well as real estate and gold stocks. His choice for =
our contest is Security Capital, a holding company for a number of real esta=
te investment trusts and private real estate entities.=20
Morgan Stanley chief investment strategist Byron Wien rode retailer Target t=
o a 23% increase. Now he likes Oracle, arguing that it will outlast its comp=
etitors and that its share price already reflects the technology spending do=
wnturn.=20
Thrya Zerhusen, manager of the ABN AMRO/Talon Mid Cap Fund, beat the market =
last year with a 9% gain on American Power Conversion, the manufacturer of b=
ackup power supplies. Now she opts for Unisys shares, at just 0.5 times sale=
s and 9 times her 2002 earnings estimate.=20
Six new bulls join the contest. Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at=
 CIBC World Markets, picks Intel on the theory that chip companies lead tech=
nology rallies. Michael Mauboussin, chief U.S. investment strategist with Cr=
edit Suisse First Boston, goes for Enron, suggesting that the acquisition by=
 Dynegy will take place on current terms. Enron shares are trading at a 19% =
discount to their Dynegy value.=20
Anna Dopkin, manager of the T. Rowe Price Financial Services Fund, considers=
 troubled insurer Safeco a promising turnaround. Wendy Trevisani, associate =
portfolio manager with Thornburg Investment Management, says E-Trade will su=
cceed with its diversification from pure trading into banking and lending pr=
oducts.=20
Kurt Von Emster, portfolio manager of MPM BioEquities Fund, bets on Regenero=
n Pharmaceuticals: "This biotech has a prolific pipeline, a hoard of cash an=
d fantastic science." Sandi Gleason, a portfolio manager with Kayne Anderson=
 Rudnick, recommends Syncor International on the strong projected growth of =
its radiopharmaceuticals business.=20

Can shoppers save the economy?=20
Seems that when consumers get the blues they go shopping. And that's good ne=
ws for the nation's wobbly economy.
After a second consecutive week of sunnier reports, economists wonder whethe=
r their gloom--as well as their growth--forecasts may be in need of tinkerin=
g. After all, the slowdown was supposed to feel like a recession by now.=20
But don't tell that to shoppers: Michigan's consumer sentiment index actuall=
y rose in November to 83.9. The Conference Board's index of leading economic=
 indicators went up 0.3 percent in October while retail sales jumped 7.1 per=
cent.=20
What's more, for the fourth consecutive week, initial jobless rates dipped, =
this time to 427,000. The economy, in fact, is suddenly beginning to look a =
lot like it did on September 10--not robust maybe, but not hopeless either. =
Some optimistic analysts were ready to break out the champagne.=20
"These data scream that the biggest job losses are now over," says Ian Sheph=
erdson of High Frequency Economics. Adds economic adviser Joel Naroff: Such =
"positive news could lead to a much happier holiday than anyone could have d=
reamed of two months ago."=20
Four-star defense=20
Pentagon commanders are assigned to keep tabs on almost every country in the=
 world--except the United States. Now there may be a commander in chief--or =
CINC, in Pentagon-speak--for the homeland too. If the brass get its wish, CI=
NC USA will oversee fighter jets, National Guard troops, chemical-weapons ex=
perts, and other forces that defend America's skies, borders, and cities. It=
's not a new idea. But until September 11, critics concerned about violating=
 restrictions on the domestic use of military troops had rebuffed it. The bi=
gger issue now is identifying a single authority--one who reports to the pre=
sident--who would oversee the military defense within U.S. borders. The Pent=
agon wants to give the responsibility either to the North American Aerospace=
 Defense Command, or NORAD--which monitors the nation's skies--or to Joint F=
orces Command, which develops new fighting concepts.=20
A point of friction: the role of the National Guard, which is clinging to it=
s tanks and artillery even though the Pentagon sees it as better-suited for =
domestic guard duty.=20
An Anthrax Enigma=20
Clueless In Connecticut=20
Investigators are scouring the home of Ottilie Lundgren, the 94-year-old Con=
necticut woman who died of inhalation anthrax. The suspected culprit: her ma=
il. Nearby postal workers were prescribed a regimen of antibiotics while off=
icials questioned relatives and tested the home for traces of the lethal spo=
res. "This is a very unusual case that we hope will give us more clues," say=
s Jeff Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.=20
But officials say Lundgren's death--like that of Bronx hospital worker Kathy=
 Nguyen--could yield more questions than answers.=20
Smokeout=20
Tobacco Wars=20
Beware lighting up in your home in Montgomery County, Md. If the smell offen=
ds your neighbor, you could face a hefty fine. The suburban Washington, D.C.=
, county last week passed one of the nation's stiffest antismoking packages,=
 treating tobacco smoke the same as other pollutants like asbestos and radon=
=2E Violators could be fined as much as $750. "This does not say that you ca=
nnot smoke in your house," says council member Isiah Leggett. "What it says =
is that your smoke cannot cross property lines."=20
Tobacco companies threaten legal action; ditto, the American Civil Liberties=
 Union.=20
Gore, Capitalist=20
Taking Care Of Business=20
Just days after a consortium of newspapers decided Al Gore might have won th=
e Florida recount and become president if only he had insisted that the over=
votes be counted as well as the undervotes--you remember overvotes and under=
votes, don't you?--Gore announced he was forsaking politics for money, at le=
ast for now. Gore will become vice chairman of Metropolitan West Financial I=
nc., a financial services company in Los Angeles. Avoiding the big question-=
-will he keep the beard?--the former veep said: "For more than 25 years, I h=
ave worked on business and economic issues from the perspective of a public =
servant engaged in public policy. I am eager to learn more about business as=
 an active executive of this dynamic and community-oriented company."=20
While some of Gore's former aides had hoped their ex-boss would join a think=
 tank pending another run for the presidency in 2004, they now insist that a=
 private-sector job doesn't take him out of the race.=20
Falling Star=20
The Art Of The Deal=20
Early this year, Enron executives groused that Wall Street didn't appreciate=
 their innovative business model, arguing that the company was severely unde=
rvalued at $80 per share. If only investors showed that kind of disrespect f=
or Enron today. The beleaguered Houston energy trader's stock price tumbled =
to as low as $4 last week, threatening a merger deal with Dynegy that is see=
n as Enron's best survival hope. The latest free fall came after Enron discl=
osed the severity of its credit crunch to regulators.=20
Both Dynegy and Enron insist the deal's still on, and Enron's shares recover=
ed slightly after its lead lender gave it more time to pay off a $690 millio=
n loan. Still, it could take six to nine months to finalize the deal.=20
Forward Spin=20
HELPING HANDS Congress returns from Thanksgiving recess to work that will in=
volve a lot of giving and no small measure of thanks. The defense appropriat=
ions bill will get early and generous attention, followed by an economic sti=
mulus bill that will be greeted with hands extended, asking that time-honore=
d question: Where's mine?=20
NEXT STOP? The last day in November is the deadline for ending sanctions aga=
inst Iraq. That seems highly unlikely given the uncertainty over any role Ba=
ghdad might have played in propping up Osama bin Laden or even in supporting=
 terrorist attacks.=20
FAIL-SAFE After dismal academic performance and a projected $1.2 billion def=
icit, Philadelphia's school district will now be under the watchful eye of n=
ot only Pennsylvania Gov. Mark Schweiker but also Edison Schools Inc. Schwei=
ker backed off a proposal to allow Edison to take over school management. In=
stead, the private company will serve as consultants and help in recruiting =
new managers for the troubled school district.

Enron, Dynegy Work to Salvage Merger Deal

Top executives of Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. raced to salvage a deal to com=
bine the two energy-trading companies amid growing signs that Enron is facin=
g cash-flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading bus=
iness.=20
The executives' task gained urgency amid worries that Enron's debt may soon =
be downgraded to junk status by leading credit-rating agencies. After holdin=
g talks with executives of Enron and Dynegy, representatives of Moody's Inve=
stors Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and Fitch Inc. agreed to=
 hold off on making any ratings move yesterday, people familiar with the dis=
cussions said. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank, which =
are shepherding the merger and have already loaned $1 billion and agreed to =
invest an additional $500 million in the merged company, may arrange still m=
ore funding for Enron, these people said.
"I hope they err on the conservative side and stockpile cash," said Ralph Pe=
llecchia, analyst for Fitch, the credit-rating agency.=20
With few viable options remaining, Enron's board late yesterday informally a=
greed to a new share-exchange ratio of 0.12 shares of Dynegy for each Enron =
share tendered, down more than 50% from the original offer of 0.2685 Dynegy =
share for each Enron share, according to one person familiar with the situat=
ion. But the talks were still fluid as of late yesterday.=20
The latest proposed share-exchange ratio values Enron at $4.91 a share, or a=
 total of $4.17 billion. This would compare with the original value of $10.9=
8 a share, or $9.33 billion. In exchange for reducing the purchase price, so=
me members of the Enron team were insisting on more control over the merged =
company. Dynegy also was considering an additional $250 million cash investm=
ent in Enron. Dynegy, together with ChevronTexaco Inc., has already injected=
 $1.5 billion into Enron in an effort to stabilize the company.=20
Talks between Enron and Dynegy were said to be tense and occasionally acrimo=
nious.=20
At 4 p.m., Enron shares were up 10 cents to $4.11, while Dynegy shares were =
up $1.64 to $40.89, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.=20
Talks between Enron and Dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the =
price of the all-stock transaction after Enron's share price had plummeted i=
n the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn't be as high as or=
iginally anticipated. On Nov. 9, Dynegy originally agreed to buy Enron after=
 the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that all=
owed Enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and=
 its shareholders. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission investigation.=20
While struggling to keep the planned merger alive, Enron also has been seeki=
ng to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings. Enron has a total=
 of about $13 billion of debt, of which about $9 billion comes due by the en=
d of next year. The company may find itself on the hook for an additional $7=
 billion in off-balance-sheet debt and another $3.9 billion in potential lia=
bilities, related to troubled investment partnerships, if its credit rating =
drops to below investment grade, says Mr. Pellecchia, the Fitch analyst. A c=
ut to a junk-status credit rating could deal a fatal blow to Enron, which ne=
eds huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive.=20
Enron, nowadays, seems to be generating less cash from that business, which =
accounted for more than 90% of its profit in the most recent quarter. In the=
 five weeks since Enron's problems became widely known, its trading partners=
 have sought to protect themselves by shifting deals elsewhere from the domi=
nant EnronOnline trading exchange and to limit their exposure to the Houston=
-based company. About a week ago, Enron said it had about $1.6 billion in ca=
sh, which surprised analysts who expected a number at least $1 billion highe=
r given the most recent infusions from Dynegy and the banks.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company "is continuing to meet all ou=
r obligations." She added that trading activity at the EnronOnline unit had =
been "below average" in recent days, but that the company believes "it has s=
tabilized."=20
Analysts say cash on hand doesn't appear to be enough to keep Enron alive fo=
r long, given the reluctance of its trading partners and creditors. Rebecca =
Followill, an analyst at Howard Weil in Houston, says that Enron needs a big=
ger cash hoard than ever to rebuild confidence. She reckons Enron needs $4 b=
illion to $5 billion on hand while the merger deal winds its way through sha=
reholder and regulatory approvals.=20

Deals & Deal Makers: Banks, Too, Have Stake in Enron Merger --- Stature, Mon=
ey Are Both on the Line

As important as completing the Enron Corp.-Dynegy Inc. merger is for the two=
 companies, it is almost as critical for the banks that have backed it.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have emerged as prominent financi=
ers and cheerleaders behind the problem-plagued transaction, putting hundred=
s of millions of dollars of their own money into Enron in hopes of keeping t=
he deal alive. Late yesterday, that effort continued, with the banks scrambl=
ing for new terms to avoid a credit downgrade that could scuttle the deal.
But in addition to putting their money behind the proposed merger, the two l=
ending giants have also staked their reputations -- and perhaps even some of=
 their prowess in the mergers-and-acquisitions business itself -- on complet=
ing this transaction.=20
Both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup officials have said privately that the pendin=
g deal is a bellwether. That is because it could illustrate how big banking =
institutions can use their lending muscle to offer customers one-stop shoppi=
ng, thus usurping business from the other, more-traditional investment-banki=
ng institutions.=20
Because the banks offered financing to Enron on short-notice to grab the adv=
isory business, the deal has the "potential for either giving a boost to a b=
ank's stature on the street or to sling some mud in its face," said Samuel H=
ayes, professor of finance at Harvard Business School. "This is a high-stake=
s assignment."=20
And an expensive one, if the deal doesn't happen. Each bank has commitments =
outstanding to Enron, in the form of various loans, of roughly $700 million =
to $800 million, according to officials familiar with the matter, and roughl=
y half of that is in unsecured debt. The two companies, these officials say,=
 have also committed an additional equity investment of $250 million each so=
 far, though there is a possibility Enron could get more.=20
As mergers go, the deal is relatively small, and it has gotten smaller in re=
cent days as investors have hammered lower Enron's stock, which at 4 p.m. ye=
sterday stood at $4.11, up 10 cents in composite trading on the New York Sto=
ck Exchange.=20
But on Wall Street, the importance of the deal goes well beyond its size, wh=
ere the transaction is seen as a high-profile example of the new era of fina=
nce in which large financials exploit the crumbling walls between once-separ=
ate businesses like lending, underwriting and mergers advisory.=20
Goldman Sachs Group, an investment bank that doesn't traditionally extend la=
rge loans to clients, was denied a piece of the merger business because it d=
eclined to extend the sort of loans that J.P. Morgan and Citigroup provided =
last week.=20
Should this deal fall through, it will make Goldman look smart. "There is a =
lot more to this deal for the banks than just [mergers and advisory] fees," =
says Andy Collins, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.=20
It is also seen as well as a major test of the decision in 1999 to repeal De=
pression-era laws under the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act.=20
For decades, the U.S. financial system effectively banned commercial banks f=
rom lending to the same clients they served as an investment bank. The think=
ing was that commercial banks, the federally insured guardians of deposits, =
shouldn't be betting in the securities markets with depositor money.=20
Now with those laws repealed, some worry about risks creeping back into the =
system. Roy Smith, a business professor at New York University, says the ban=
ks' lending to the same clients from which they seek to win securities busin=
ess could encourage banks to over-lend for the purpose of closing deals.=20
"You can't believe the chairman of the bank is up at night thinking about th=
is," says Mr. Smith.=20
The banks, while conceding some exposure to Enron, decline to confirm specif=
ic amounts, citing client confidentiality. But in private conversations, ban=
ks say they regularly sell loans to companies in which they may be too expos=
ed in an active secondary market. Moreover, they use other credit derivative=
s to effectively transfer the risk of loans to other investors.=20
Some of the recent documentation of Enron debt suggests that much of the deb=
t has been diversified across many investors. In May 2001, for example, Citi=
group and J.P. Morgan arranged a large $2.25 billion credit facility for Enr=
on, part of the total of approximately $13 billion in debt on Enron's balanc=
e sheet (not including commitments to other financial institutions).=20
Those two banks, as lead arrangers of that financing, helped divide that loa=
n up among 50 different banks, according to Loan Pricing Corp., a research i=
nstitute the follows the lending business. Many of those banks divided their=
 shares into even smaller pieces and sold them off to other investors. One b=
anker familiar with the matter said that, all told, more than 100 financial =
institutions have exposure to Enron.=20
Yet J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, who have served as the top underwriters of th=
is debt, would rather avoid being blamed for letting Enron's debts go bad. E=
ven more importantly, they also hold their own portion of that debt. Thus, b=
oth banks recently provided an additional credit line to Enron totaling $1 b=
illion.=20
That additional lending, while enhancing the value of existing loans to Enro=
n, is also relatively safe because it is secured with hard assets. Should En=
ron default, the banks would take an interest in that collateral. "That addi=
tional credit line is bullet proof," says one banker.=20
The banks, ultimately, have had a string of successes with similar strategie=
s with other firms, though few are as high-profile as Enron. These two banks=
, for example, are credited with saving companies like Lucent Technologies f=
rom a financial crisis earlier this year with a similar combination of finan=
cing and investment banking advise. But speaking privately, bankers concede =
that a failure of the Enron deal would smart beyond what the damage might be=
 to the banks' loan portfolio.=20
"If it falls apart," says Mr. Hayes, the Harvard professor, "it will be a so=
urce of embarrassment."=20

Energy-Trading Market Survives Enron for Now
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Peter A. McKay in New York, Chip Cumm=
ins in Washington, and Alexei Barrionuevo and Thaddeus Herrick in Houston

Enron Corp.'s precarious financial condition has unnerved investors and trad=
ing partners, but the largely invisible natural-gas and electricity trading =
industry that it helped build appears relatively resilient -- at least so fa=
r.=20
Veteran traders say many firms began to take precautionary steps a month ago=
 against an energy-market meltdown related to Enron, when the first tidbits =
of the Houston-based company's woes were reported. Trading volume has moved =
from the popular EnronOnline electronic platform to other venues, some trade=
rs have unwound complex financial bets, and others have simply worked around=
 their onetime trading partner.
As a result, insiders say natural-gas prices, in particular, haven't really =
been affected so far by Enron's problems, and any impact is expected to be m=
oderate.=20
Unlike a traditional commodities exchange, open to all, natural gas and elec=
tricity are traded privately, with many transactions reflecting deals betwee=
n two players. EnronOnline, for instance, acts as both the buyer and seller,=
 setting the price for which it will buy or sell commodities such as natural=
 gas or electricity. Players such as Enron, which had transformed itself fro=
m a natural-gas pipeline company, make money by buying and selling energy ma=
ny times over, capturing the difference between bids from buyers and offers =
from sellers. But actual trading strategies are tightly kept secrets, which =
has made the business difficult to track and assess.=20
While the energy market has held up amid Enron's woes, it remains edgy, espe=
cially given the uncertainty about what might happen if Dynegy Inc.'s agreem=
ent to acquire Enron is aborted. "Companies have stopped doing business with=
 Enron to the best of their ability," says Art Gelber, principal of Gelber &=
 Associates, a Houston energy-consulting and asset-management firm. But, he =
adds, Enron has such an enormous presence in the energy-trading marketplace =
that it is impossible to stop doing business with the company altogether. "W=
e have customers with long-term commitments to Enron, and they're scared to =
death," Mr. Gelber notes. "If they had to start anew, it wouldn't be with En=
ron."=20
For the most part, major natural-gas producers, such as Devon Energy Corp. o=
f Oklahoma City, say they have made adjustments in their contracts with Enro=
n. Devon currently has a few contracts for physical gas sales to Enron total=
ing less than 1% of Devon's total gas sales, said Darryl Smette, Devon's sen=
ior vice president of marketing. So far, Enron has met all its obligations.=20
At the same time, other trading players have stepped in to fill the void. Th=
ose benefiting most include American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp., =
Koch Energy Trading, Morgan Stanley, El Paso Corp. and Dynegy itself, accord=
ing to traders who deal with Enron.=20
"We certainly see a lot of customers calling us, more trying to revive relat=
ionships that have been dormant for a while," says one trading executive.=20
The relative calm is surprising to those both inside and outside the markets=
, because so many of the natural-gas and electricity trades are intertwined.=
=20
Last year, the value of energy-based contracts outstanding among the 12 big =
traders tracked by Swaps Monitor, a trade publication, more than tripled ove=
r 1999 to $2.19 trillion. Electricity trading accounted for $365 billion of =
that amount, up from just $39 billion the year before. Yet just 10 companies=
 accounted for about 60% of the electricity traded in North America, making =
the companies highly dependent on each other.=20
Even Enron employees have tried to head off a crisis, notes the head of powe=
r trading for one big energy-trading company, who asked not to be identified=
=2E He says Enron traders have worked for several weeks with traders at othe=
r firms to make arrangements in the event that Enron contracts need to be li=
quidated or the partners decide Enron isn't creditworthy enough.=20
To do this, Enron traders have been pairing Enron customers up with each oth=
er. For instance, a customer who bought electricity from Enron at a certain =
price is being matched up with another customer who sold electricity to Enro=
n. The three-party transaction allows two Enron customers to meet their powe=
r needs while at the same time reducing their exposure to Enron.=20
"Enron has been cooperating in packaging large deals to enable people to do =
that," this trader explains. The traders may have a motive, he says, adding =
that "the people who are helping you are likely to be looking for a job in t=
wo months."=20
Companies have been unwinding exposure to Enron for several weeks, adds this=
 trader, who estimates that many companies are likely to have reduced exposu=
re by about half by now.=20
If more bad news rocks Enron, the power and natural-gas markets may move upw=
ard -- though excess supply and low prices are likely to make any sort of sp=
ike relatively insignificant, compared with the volatility of a year ago.=20
Still, the perception that Enron might not be able to deliver against its po=
sitions has nudged natural-gas prices a little, says Guy Gleichmann, senior =
energy trader at Barkley Financial. He estimates that natural-gas prices hav=
e an "Enron premium" of about 25 cents built in; gas closed at $2.62 a milli=
on British thermal units in New York Mercantile Exchange trading yesterday.=20
Even in a worst-case scenario, however, most traders assume that whoever tak=
es control of the company's assets will probably handle delivery of commodit=
ies against its contracts, he says.=20
"Enron has caused some short-term price moves, but it's not a big part of wh=
at the market is going to do in the long run," says Bill O'Neill, director o=
f commodity research at Merrill Lynch & Co. "You have to remember that the f=
undamentals for energy, particularly demand, are not too good right now, bec=
ause of the economy."=20
Indeed, natural-gas storage is nearly full, and so far, warm fall weather ha=
sn't helped demand any. "A growing inventory of natural gas should have a mo=
derating effect on any transitional difficulties that might arise because of=
 a continued downward path for Enron," says Jon Rasmussen, an economist at t=
he Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.=20
One clear impact has been on EnronOnline, Enron's electronic trading arm tha=
t had become the dominant energy e-trading platform in recent years, account=
ing for as much as 25% of the country's natural-gas and electricity deliveri=
es. The rival IntercontinentalExchange Inc. has reported a 34% jump in its w=
eekly electricity volume since October, 13% in natural gas, and a 45% increa=
se in crude oil. The Atlanta-based concern is owned by about 100 energy and =
metals traders, brokers and banks.=20
Other traders have returned to doing trades over the phone, a less transpare=
nt method than pulling prices off a screen. "This is doing a lot to re-estab=
lish human contact," says one trading executive.

Business World: Enron Is History, Says History
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

11/28/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Back in the mid-1980s, a pipeline executive called Ken Lay was fishing aroun=
d for a name for his company, produced by a merger of Houston Natural Gas an=
d Omaha-based InterNorth. He consulted with consultants, politicked with pol=
iticians, and came up with a moniker. The company would be called "Enteron."=
=20
Three weeks later, fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked u=
p the dictionary definition of "enteron" (n. the intestine), he changed the =
company's name again. Henceforth it would be known as Enron.
A columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to ex=
tend the metaphor of the company's misbegotten name. In recent weeks, after =
all, we've seen Enron's stock collapse over indigestible accounting and the =
emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers that exude=
 an odor of genuine malfeasance. The evidence is far from clear, but for the=
 sake of Mr. Lay's reputation one hopes these missteps will prove one more c=
ase of a company fooling itself rather than setting out deliberately to defr=
aud the markets.=20
Enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas, becoming t=
he pre-eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a vo=
cal proponent of deregulation. Now, all but overnight, it's kaput, just wait=
ing to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an erstwhile=
 rival.=20
We cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the 1970s, =
Phibro (short for Philipp Brothers). Hard to believe, but Phibro was once a =
name that made grown men quiver on Wall Street. Fattened by trading profits =
from the great commodity inflation of the 1970s, which some mistook for a pe=
rmanent new age of scarcity, it scooped up the Street's oldest partnership, =
Salomon Brothers, tucking it into its back pocket and renaming the combined =
firm Phibro-Salomon. Here was a powerhouse of unlimited potential, investors=
 told themselves.=20
Flash ahead to California's electricity meltdown earlier this year. Enron sa=
w its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being quo=
ted in the California market. Many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend, but the=
re was no true energy shortage. Posted prices on the California power exchan=
ge may have skyrocketed, but the effective price was zero dollars and zero c=
ents, because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were thumbing=
 their noses at piles of IOUs.=20
When prices are zero, suppliers take a hike -- that's what economics teaches=
=2E But once the state government started pumping its own cash into the mark=
et, the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful again. N=
ow California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an "energy crisis"=
 anymore.=20
You can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to the =
moment when the California fiasco began to repair itself. Fortune Magazine p=
ut the inaugural nail in Enron's coffin in March, noting that the company's =
growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil-patch version of Gol=
dman Sachs. Goldman's stock sells at a price-earnings multiple of 17, reflec=
ting investors' well-founded distrust of trading earnings to be reproduced r=
eliably year after year. So why, the magazine asked, was Enron awarded a mul=
tiple of 60-plus? Mmm . . .=20
Enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation. Boss Ken Lay, a beli=
ever in technology and the power of markets, was a true visionary, to the po=
int of annoying people who didn't care for his air of being a man on the rig=
ht side of history. The moldering pipeline he took over would certainly have=
 been an also-ran if he had not thrown Enron headlong into trading and marke=
ting.=20
But deregulation doesn't confer permanent advantage on anybody. A deregulate=
d environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting of plans =
and strategies.=20
Add the fact that, despite the California bubble, there is no reason to beli=
eve energy prices won't continue their long-term relative decline as technol=
ogy advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional resources. Add =
also the likelihood that information technology will continue to lower the b=
arriers to entry to Enron's trading business, which means more competition a=
nd shrinking margins. Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro.=20
The great commodity-trading machine was already running down by 1981, when i=
t bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning. Inflation was being quelled b=
y Paul Volcker. The products that Phibro traders bought and sold were increa=
singly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges. "Four or five yea=
rs ago, they used to be able to take other companies to the cleaners, becaus=
e they knew where the market was and others didn't," a trader explained. "Wi=
th everyone knowing, within a few cents, where the price of any product was,=
 Phibro's ability to make a profit off its superior knowledge disappeared."=20
Not only is this true of Enron, but of its would-be bottom fisher, Dynegy, r=
un by Mr. Lay's Houston homeboy, Chuck Watson. Dynegy's proposed takeover of=
 its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday.=20
While Enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on ele=
ctronic market-making, Mr. Watson was doing the opposite. His big play in th=
e Enron deal is to get his hands on the original HNG-InterNorth pipeline, no=
w known as Northern Natural Gas. By having both feet planted in the real bus=
iness, he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out of =
trading despite growing competition and transparency.=20
We'll see. Dynegy and Enron were born at the same time, and of the same moti=
ve. Dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies, a Washington la=
w firm and Morgan Stanley to take advantage of new opportunities in deregula=
ted natural gas. But the gnats are already circling.=20
Gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of th=
eir fate now insist they shouldn't be allowed to merge. Don't listen to the =
fussbudgets. If this was a business in need of trustbusting, Enron wouldn't =
have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings. As Merrill Lyn=
ch's Donato Eassey has pointed out, wholesale margins have been steadily thi=
nning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive.=20
Wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies wh=
ose dearly held "visions" were not panning out. Enron prided itself on being=
 realistic and adaptive, but it failed to see that its own beliefs about the=
 world needed overhauling.

THE MARKETS: Market Place
Trying to Restore Confidence in Enron to Salvage a Merger
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

11/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation and Dynegy Inc. worked yesterday to find ways to bolst=
er confidence in Enron's weakened energy-trading business as the companies' =
negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger, executive=
s close to the talks said.=20
The renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half, they s=
aid, to roughly $4 billion. Dynegy, they said, was also prepared to invest a=
t least an additional $250 million in Enron, on top of the $1.5 billion cash=
 infusion from Dynegy's biggest investor, ChevronTexaco, included in the ini=
tial deal announced Nov. 9. But Dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard ass=
ets, and the companies were trying to identify and value enough Enron holdin=
gs not already mortgaged to other creditors, the executives said.
Before a series of financial disclosures sent Enron's stock into collapse an=
d the company into the arms of Dynegy, its Houston rival, Enron's natural ga=
s and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest comp=
etitors combined. They also accounted for the majority of Enron's profits by=
 far.=20
But traders and Wall Street analysts said the business had steadily deterior=
ated amid questions about the depths of Enron's financial straits. Many trad=
ers have curtailed dealings with Enron, and the executives close to the talk=
s said Dynegy officials scouring Enron's books were having difficulty this w=
eek figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating.=20
The executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for Dyneg=
y's acquisition of Enron would lower the price to about 0.13 Dynegy share fo=
r each share of Enron, cutting by half the value of the deal announced Nov. =
9, when Dynegy offered 0.2685 share. If a deal is struck at 0.13 Dynegy shar=
e, at yesterday's closing prices, Dynegy would be paying about $5.32 an Enro=
n share, a 29.4 percent premium over Enron's diminished stock price. The pre=
mium was 20.6 percent over Enron's closing price on the day that the deal wa=
s announced.=20
Both companies are seeking promises from Enron's bank lenders to extend debt=
 repayment dates until after the merger closes. And they are also discussing=
 adding provisions that could limit Dynegy's ability to back out of the comb=
ination.=20
The two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $500 millio=
n from J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup that would provide Enron with desper=
ately needed new cash.=20
But there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not =
calm investors' fears or reassure energy traders, leading Dynegy to seek an =
additional $500 million in cash for Enron. Late yesterday, the two companies=
 were hung up over whether Enron, which has already used many of its most pr=
ized assets as collateral for loans, has enough assets left to serve as coll=
ateral for the additional money, according to executives close to the talks.=
=20
A number of Enron assets were being examined, including some that have alrea=
dy been used to obtain other loans, the executives said. The assets include:=
 Transwestern Pipeline, a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas-prod=
ucing basins of Texas and the Southwest with California; Enron's stake in ot=
her gas-pipeline assets; its 9.8 percent stake, worth about $400 million, in=
 EOG Resources, a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly trad=
ed oil and gas company; and its indirect stake in Hanover Compressor, which =
manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and faci=
litate its flow on interstate pipelines.=20
Yesterday, investors anxiously awaited a report by Moody's Investors Service=
, which like other major credit-rating firms, currently ranks Enron's debt a=
t the lowest investment-grade level. If Enron were to lose its investment-gr=
ade status, it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in d=
ebt, while other traders would probably further curtail business. But by lat=
e yesterday, Moody's decided not to issue a statement after receiving assura=
nces from Enron and Dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be annou=
nced soon, the executives said. A Moody's spokesman declined comment.=20
Executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from Dynegy=
 would reassure both Wall Street and the energy-trading markets that Enron's=
 trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset.=20
But analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the=
 trading operation has already lost, and how much the business has been redu=
ced because of credit concerns.=20
''I believe Dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core busines=
s and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result,'' said Andre Mead=
e, head of United States utilities research for Commerzbank Securities in Ne=
w York. ''I don't think anyone can estimate the earning power of Enron over =
the next three to four quarters, and I'm not sure Enron has a good estimate.=
''=20
Mr. Meade said he did not believe that Dynegy's earlier estimate that the ac=
quisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was ''reliable today, g=
iven how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated.'' By Mr. Meade's c=
alculations, if Enron's trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year --=
 even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 -- that would wipe out=
 nearly all the value in the stock.=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said the company had experienced a declin=
e in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with =
it, but both stabilized yesterday. She declined to elaborate or quantify the=
 decline.=20
She also said that Enron's trading operation remained profitable, though she=
 could not quantify it, and she also said she did not know whether the compa=
ny was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans sh=
ould its business and liquidity worsen. ''We're moving forward with the merg=
er,'' she said.=20
Dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday.=20
Shares of Enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agr=
eement. They closed at $4.11, up 2.5 percent, or 10 cents. Shares of Dynegy =
closed at $40.89, up 4.2 percent, or $1.64.=20
Though yesterday's gains halted a four-day slide in Enron shares, the stock =
is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as si=
gnificant accounting errors that led Enron to admit it overstated profits du=
ring the last five years by nearly $600 million.=20
Now, difficulties within Enron's trading operation are exacerbating the comp=
any's overall liquidity problems in three ways, according to some analysts a=
nd rival energy-trading executives.=20
First, other traders are requiring Enron to put up greater margin on its tra=
des. On top of that, in some cases Enron's traders are being forced to pay m=
ore to buy natural gas than traders at other companies. This credit premium =
in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million Br=
itish thermal units of gas Enron buys, these people say.=20
Additionally, many traders, like the Mirant Corporation, have either scaled =
back or stopped doing business with Enron, hurting its trading revenue.=20
Mr. Meade of Commerzbank said ''end-use customers and trading counterparties=
 appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of Enron's =
credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to Enron.''

Enron, Dynegy pursue the right price=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Dynegy and Enron Corp. continued discussions Tuesday on several issues, incl=
uding new terms for Dynegy's deal to buy Enron and an equity infusion for En=
ron, according to people familiar with the talks.=20
There was no sense talks were breaking down, but instead there were a lot of=
 pieces that needed to be put in place, the people said.=20
Sources told the Chronicle on Monday that the two Houston-based energy trade=
rs were negotiating a lower exchange rate for Dynegy's stock deal to buy Enr=
on.=20
The sources also said Enron and Dynegy were working with a group of banks to=
 reach a so-called "override" agreement to extend, until after the merger cl=
oses, maturity dates for certain Enron debt, and that the two energy compani=
es were working to finalize terms for equity infusion into Enron of around $=
500 million, expected to come from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup.=20
Dynegy, one source said Tuesday, could also be a contributor to that $500 mi=
llion.=20
Under the Nov. 9 deal, Enron shareholders would receive 0.2685 share of Dyne=
gy stock per Enron share owned. Since then, there have been increasing worri=
es about Enron's core trading business and new troubling financial disclosur=
es from Enron.=20
The sources said Tuesday the new ratio being discussed is around 0.15.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Tuesday he could confirm only that Dynegy w=
as in discussions with parties involved in transactions related to the deal.=
=20
Investors appeared optimistic Tuesday that Dynegy and Enron would work out a=
n arrangement to save the merger. Shares in Dynegy closed up $1.64 at $40.89=
, while shares in Enron closed up 10 cents at $4.11.=20
Wall Street expects Dynegy to either cut its purchase price or walk away. Th=
at Dynegy is negotiating a lower exchange ratio shows it is very intent on k=
eeping the deal together, said Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. I=
nternational in Houston.=20
If the deal falls apart, Enron would likely see its credit rating cut to so-=
called junk status, which would trigger a series of negative consequences. A=
mong them: Enron's ability to run its trading business would be severely ham=
pered. In turn, Enron could quickly be forced into bankruptcy.=20
Enron's trading operation, which is highly dependent upon access to cash and=
 credit, is already suffering. Enron hopes another equity infusion will spur=
 other traders to return the business they've taken elsewhere.=20
"It appears that trading counterparties have moved significant volumes away =
from Enron over the past few weeks as a result of credit concerns," Andre Me=
ade, an analyst at Commerzbank Securities in New York, wrote in a report Tue=
sday morning.=20
That new deal terms are being discussed "confirms our fears that Enron's cor=
e trading and marketing business has been rapidly deteriorating and is worth=
 much less today than several weeks ago," Meade said.=20
Tuesday afternoon, word spread among analysts and investors that Moody's Inv=
estors Service would issue a rating report on Enron before day's end. They w=
ere waiting to see if Moody's would have soothing words on Enron or drop its=
 credit rating to junk, but no report was released.=20
Enron is expected to lay off employees this week.=20

Cooperation from Enron key in probe=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Federal officials say they are willing to be more lenient with companies tha=
t cooperate in securities fraud cases, an attitude that could help get Enron=
 Corp. off the hook in its current SEC investigation.=20
But it could also put individual executives -- including its former chief fi=
nancial officer and other former employees -- in the hot seat.=20
In the months since he took over as head of the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission, Chairman Harvey Pitt has laid out policies that will give companies =
credit for coming forward to report misconduct such as improper accounting. =
The message has been that cooperation could spare companies harsher penaltie=
s.=20
The SEC is so serious about its new attitude that late last month it took th=
e highly unusual step of outlining the reasons it decided not to bring an en=
forcement action against Seaboard Corp. of Shawnee Mission, Kan.=20
The pork processing and cargo shipping company issued misstatements in its a=
nnual and quarterly reports from December 1995 to March 2000 based on improp=
er entries booked by a controller at a Florida division.=20
In a statement, the SEC said the company's conduct was key to it avoiding th=
e enforcement action because within a week of finding the alleged misconduct=
, internal auditors did a preliminary review and advised management and its =
board of directors, who then hired an outside law firm to do an independent =
review.=20
Four days later the controller who covered up the problems was fired, along =
with two supervisors, and the public was notified of the problem. The SEC re=
ached a settlement directly with the former controller, where she agreed not=
 to violate securities laws in the future.=20
While the Seaboard case is the only enforcement action to occur since the ne=
w policies were put in place, observers say it's likely they could be applie=
d to Enron in the SEC investigation.=20
"You won't see the SEC be easy on anyone," said Frank Velie, a former U.S. a=
ttorney and partner with New York-based Salans Hertzfeld Heilbronn Christy &=
 Viener. "But if you have an individual, or a small group of individuals who=
 acted illegally, and the company acts swiftly to fire them, turn over infor=
mation to the SEC and cooperate, in many cases the company can escape prosec=
ution."=20
Since SEC officials began looking into a number of off-balance-sheet partner=
ships formed by Enron's former CFO, Andrew Fastow, the company has gone to g=
reat lengths to appear cooperative and to distance itself from anyone associ=
ated with the partnerships.=20
The day after an earnings report last month revealed Enron would lose $35 mi=
llion and take a $1 billion hit on shareholder equity because of the complex=
 financing partnerships, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay =
and the company's board of directors said they stood by Fastow. The board ha=
d approved all the partnerships and dealings, it was noted.=20
A week later, however, on Oct. 24, the company replaced Fastow.=20
On Oct. 31, the day Enron said the SEC had upgraded its review of the financ=
es from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation, the company announced it=
's board of directors had created an investigation committee of its own with=
 the power to take disciplinary action against any Enron employee, officer o=
r director who it determined " ... improperly participated in the transactio=
ns."=20
The committee took action shortly after, as several employees were fired for=
 their involvement in the deals, a spokesman said, including Ben Glisan, a m=
anaging director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a mana=
ging director and general counsel of an Enron division. Other employees who =
were determined to have invested in the partnerships, including Fastow and e=
xecutives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer work for Enr=
on.=20
In its SEC filing that outlined more details of the partnerships earlier thi=
s month, Enron again tried to distance itself from the deals by saying that =
it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put=
 in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly.=20
Painting the company as a relative innocent that fell victim to the dealings=
 of renegade employees may make sense in the face of the SEC inquiry, but it=
 won't ensure safe passage for Enron, says Henry Hu, a law professor at the =

Dynegy Completes $600 Mln Purchase of U.K. Gas Storage Assets

Dynegy Completes $600 Mln Purchase of U.K. Gas Storage Assets

     Houston, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc., which is buying
rival U.S. energy trader Enron Corp., completed its acquisition of
BG Group Plc's U.K. natural gas-storage subsidiary for about
$600 million, its first purchase of energy assets in Europe.

     Dynegy used cash and short-term borrowings to pay for the
acquisition, which was announced in July. BG Storage is expected
to boost 2002 earnings, Houston-based Dynegy said in a statement.

     The purchase includes two storage terminals, Rough and
Hornsea, which are used by about half of the U.K.'s gas shippers
and can store 111 billion cubic feet, Dynegy said. The business
also has 19 miles of pipeline and an onshore gas-processing plant
in Easington, England. BG Storage's 260 workers will become
employees of Dynegy.

     Dynegy, which trades gas in Germany, the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Scandinavia, has said it needs physical energy
assets in Europe to support its trading business. Dynegy is in
talks to lower the price of its acquisition of Enron, the biggest
energy trader, from its current $23 billion in stock and assumed
debt.

     Shares of Dynegy rose $1.64 to $40.89 yesterday. They have
fallen 27 percent this year. Enron, also based in Houston, rose 10
cents to $4.11. The stock has plunged 95 percent this year.

Natural Gas, Electricity Trading Appears Resilient, WSJ Reports
2001-11-28 06:32 (New York)


     Houston, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Despite Enron Corp.'s
precarious financial condition, the natural gas and electricity
trading industry appears relatively resilient and prices haven't
yet been affected, the Wall Street Journal said.

     Trading companies, which began to take precautionary steps a
month ago when news about Enron's woes were first reported, have
moved trading from EnronOnline to other venues, the paper said.
Some traders have unwound complex financial bets, while others
have simply worked around Enron.

     Unlike a traditional commodities exchange, open to all,
natural gas and electricity are traded privately, often with
contracts between two parties, the Journal said. EnronOnline acts
as a buyer and seller, setting the price for which it will buy or
sell commodities.

     However, the energy market remains concerned given the
uncertainty of what might happen if Dynegy Inc.'s purchase of
Enron falls through. Companies that would benefit from a potential
trading void include American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy
Corp., El Paso Corp. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.


J.P. Morgan, Citigroup Have Stakes in Enron Purchase, WSJ Says
2001-11-28 05:53 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and
Citigroup Inc., as of late yesterday, were looking for new terms
in Dynegy Inc.'s planed purchase of Enron Corp. in order to
maintain their banking stature, the Wall Street Journal said.

     The banks, which have put hundreds of millions of dollars
into completing the purchase, have also placed their reputations
in the mergers and acquisitions business on this transaction, the
paper said. The banks are also trying to avoid a credit downgrade
that could scrap the transaction.

     Officials at both banks, whom the Journal didn't name, said
the pending transaction is a bellwether because it shows how banks
like J.P. Morgan and Citigroup can use their lending ``muscle'' to
offer one-stop shopping.

     Each bank has committed $700 million to $800 million in the
form of various loans, the paper reported, citing officials
familiar with the matter. Half of that amount is unsecured debt.
The banks also have committed $250 million each.


Enron's 401(k) Savings Plan Was Set Up for a Fall: David Wilson
2001-11-28 06:02 (New York)

Enron's 401(k) Savings Plan Was Set Up for a Fall: David Wilson

     (Commentary. David Wilson is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.
employees participating in a company-sponsored savings plan were
more vulnerable than usual to this year's 95 percent plunge in its
share price.

     Common and convertible preferred shares of Enron, the largest
energy trader, increased as a percentage of the plan's assets last
year for the first time since 1994, according to filings submitted
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The stock amounted to 62 percent of assets in the so-called
401(k) plan, designed to help people save for retirement, at the
end of 2000. That figure was the highest in six years; in both
1998 and 1999, it had been less than a majority.

     Participants in the plan, which had $2.14 billion in assets
available for benefits, could only do so much to diversify their
investments. Enron, like many other companies, uses stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricts sales of
the shares.

     And they could only guess at the year-end makeup of the
plan's assets until the end of June, reflecting SEC disclosure
standards for savings plans. By that time, the stock's drop was
already well under way.

                         Trio of Lawsuits

     Enron has since reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter
charges; ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran
partnerships that accounted for some of the charges; restated its
results since 1997; become the target of an SEC investigation into
its accounting; and accepted a takeover bid from Dynegy Inc., its
biggest rival.

     The company's shares, which ended last year at $83.13, fell
as low as $3.83 yesterday amid concern that Dynegy might abandon
its offer for the Houston-based company. They closed at $4.11.

     In response to the plunge, employees in the 401(k) plan --
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax-free
savings, and takes its name from a section of the Internal Revenue
Service code -- have filed three lawsuits against Enron.

     The suits allege, among other things, that Enron prevented
employees from shifting investments within the plan between Oct.
17, the day after its disclosure of the charges, and Nov. 19 as
the company made administrative changes.

     All three seek class-action status on behalf of the plan's
participants. The most recent filing came from the Gottesdiener
Law Firm, based in Washington, on Monday. It covers the longest
time period: November 1995 to now.

                        Falling Percentages

     Enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan's
assets at the end of 1994, the year before the period associated
with the Gottesdiener suit began. The figure reflected a one-time
contribution of preferred stock, and rose from 62 percent in 1993.

     Each preferred share has a face value of $100 and is
convertible into 27.304 common shares. This translates into a
conversion price of $3.66 a share, about 12 percent lower than
yesterday's closing price.

     The plan also owned a stake in Enron's former oil and gas
unit, which became EOG Resources Inc. after gaining independence
in 1999. Add in those shares, and company stock represented about
two-thirds of the 1994 assets.

     Enron's common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of
401(k) assets available for benefits in 1995, 58 percent in 1996
and 53 percent in 1997 as the U.S. stock market rallied, lifting
the value of participants' investments in equity mutual funds.

     The shares represented 49 percent of the plan's assets in
1998. The proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999, when the
assets more than doubled -- exceeding the 56 percent increase in
Enron's share price that year -- to $1.62 billion.

                         How Much Choice?

     Then came last year, when the common stock recorded its best
performance in more than two decades even as U.S. stocks stumbled.
Enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and natural gas
prices, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, a market benchmark
that includes the company, fell 10 percent.

     Company shares in the plan rose in value by $652.7 million,
according to an SEC filing. The total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year. By contrast, mutual-fund holdings fell
by $47 million and ``other investments'' rose by just $134,000,
the filing said.

     At year-end, the 401(k) plan owned 13.9 million Enron common
shares and 70,000 preferred shares, valued at $1.32 billion. This
total encompasses not only Enron's matching contributions to the
plan, but also employees' investments with their own money.

     The company generally provides a 50 percent match, in stock,
for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan. Employees
can't sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of 50.

     About 11 percent of the plan's stock holdings came from the
contributions, said Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman. The figure
suggests participants invested more heavily in their company than
usual for 401(k) participants.

                         Waiting for Data

     For the average U.S. plan account, company stock amounted to
19 percent of assets at the end of last year, according to a study
done by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and the Investment
Company Institute and published last week.

     In any case, Enron's approach to matching ensures that as
much as one-third of the contribution to an employee's account
takes the form of shares that they can't sell right away.

     Anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach, and Enron's
stock performance, affected the plan's financial position last
year had to wait until June 27. That's when the filing cited
earlier arrived at the SEC.

     Employee savings and stock-purchase plans, such as 401(k)
plans, don't have to submit annual reports until 180 days after
their fiscal year ends. They can even get a 15-day extension of
the deadline if they need one.

     By the time Enron's plan made its annual report, it was
already a bit too late to act on the information. The company's
shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of
the submission. As the filing demonstrated, employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall.

Enron Receives Proposal for $1 Billion Investment, FT Says
2001-11-28 00:01 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. has received a
proposal from a group of investors willing to provide the energy
trader with more than $1 billion, the Financial Times reported,
citing an unidentified person close to the talks.

     The funding would be provided through an equity investment in
the Houston-based company, the Financial Times reported. The
investment could assure Dynegy Inc. that Enron can survive for the
nine months it may take for Dynegy to acquire the company, the
paper reported.

     The new proposal is believed to be different from Enron's
efforts to secure $500 million in financing from J.P. Morgan and
Citigroup Inc., the paper reported. It is not clear who is
involved in the new consortium, whether Enron will accept the
proposal or on what terms it was made, the Financial Times
reported.

     Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron, told the paper that the
company was trying to secure $500 million to $1 billion worth of
equity financing and to restructure its debt, the paper said.



GLOBAL INVESTING - Enron faces lawsuits over handling of pension plan ENERGY=
 TRADER'S EMPLOYEES ALLEGE ...

GLOBAL INVESTING - Enron faces lawsuits over handling of pension plan ENERGY=
 TRADER'S EMPLOYEES ALLEGE ASSETS WERE FROZEN.=20
Enron, the troubled energy trading company, is facing four lawsuits for its =
handling of its employee retirement plan, one of which claims $850m in losse=
s. Enron employees allege that the company froze the plan's assets, stopping=
 them from selling company shares they held in the plan as the stock price p=
lunged.
The third suit, filed on Monday night by the Washington, DC-based Gottesdien=
er Law Firm, also claims Enron breached its fiduciary duty over the retireme=
nt plan when it sold employees company stock knowing the share price was art=
ificially high. Enron shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 t=
o a 52-week low of $4.01 as of Monday's close. Its shares began a rapid fall=
 from about $30 in mid-October on news of improper accounting practices.=20
Between October 17 and November 19, Enron "locked down" the retirement plan,=
 barring employees from selling their shares. From the market's close on Oct=
ober 16 to November 19, Enron shares lost 73 per cent of their value. Eli Go=
ttesdiener, Gottesdiener's principal, said that his claim of $850m was based=
 on the drop in the value of the company stock in the pension fund from $1.3=
bn at the start of the year to about $100m today.=20
Enron shares accounted for about 60 per cent of the $2.1bn plan's assets at =
the end of 2000, according to another of the lawsuits, filed by the law firm=
 Campbell Harrison last week.=20
That amount was far too high for prudent diversification of investment, Mr G=
ottesdiener said. This was in addition to his objection to Enron's "lockdown=
", which forced employees to watch as their retirement savings plunged while=
 the fund underwent administrative changes. "We allege a breach of fiduciary=
 duty under the circumstances," he said. "Knowing that people would want to =
sell their stock, and realising that Enron was not the company they thought =
it was, under those circumstances, to lock people in, was grossly negligent =
and a violation of Enron's duty."=20
The lawsuits raise several issues, such as a company's fiduciary duty in off=
ering its own shares to employees in a retirement plan, and its right to ban=
 employees from selling shares.=20
Defined contribution plans such as Enron's, in which employees allocate thei=
r retirement money from a menu of choices including mutual funds and company=
 stock, are regulated by the Labor Department. They are not overseen by the =
Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees traditional mutual funds.=
=20
No regulation limits companies' ability to start such "lockdowns", beyond ba=
sic fiduciary duty. As a result, there is little day-to-day oversight of the=
 management of the investments, said Geoff Bobroff, a former SEC attorney an=
d financial services industry consultant.=20
An older type of employee retirement plan - a defined benefit plan - has a 1=
0 per cent limit on the amount of company stock that can be held in the pens=
ion fund because these plans are administered entirely by the company. But t=
he legislation does not extend to defined contribution plans. Mr Gottesdiene=
r said part of the reason he was bringing the lawsuit was to push for legisl=
ation to place the same 10 per cent cap on company stock in defined contribu=
tion plans that exists for defined benefit plans.=20
He added that when a company matched the employee contribution with its own =
stock alone, it pushed employees to buy more company stock, forsaking pruden=
t diversification. "As long as companies match their employees' contribution=
s in their own stock, people take that as implicit investment advice."=20
Enron's only matching contributions were in company stock.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron works to save Dynegy bid.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/28/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron was yesterday locked in negotiations with Dynegy, its energy trading r=
ival, about reworking the details of Dynegy's rescue bid.=20
Dynegy is understood to be considering halving the value of the all-stock bi=
d in the light of Enron's deepening financial crisis.
John Sousa, spokesman for Dynegy, said: "I can confirm that we are in discus=
sions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure =
of the deal."=20
Dynegy's bid, launched on November 9, is worth $11 a share - or $9.4bn - but=
 the Enron shares were trading yesterday morning at $4.12.=20
Enron's fate still depends on Dynegy's commitment to the deal, lenders' will=
ingness to restructure their loans, and credit ratings agencies' decision no=
t to downgrade Enron debt to junk status.=20
A downgrade by the large rating agencies would trigger a series of collatera=
l calls by trading counterparties. It would also oblige Enron to repay about=
 $3.3bn of bonds. Karen Denne, Enron spokeswoman, said: "We're still working=
 on an equity infusion of $500m to $1bn. And we're still working on restruct=
uring our debt."=20
The most likely investors are JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which have alre=
ady extended a $1bn secured credit line to Enron and are the energy group's =
principal advisers on the Dynegy deal.=20
"You have five moving parts: Dynegy, Chevron-Texaco (which owns 26 per cent =
of Dynegy), Enron, Citigroup and Chase. All these people are horse trading,"=
 said John Olson, of Sanders Morris Harris, a Houston-based investment banki=
ng and securities firm.=20

Enron's Many Victims

Enron, the Houston energy company that helped throw California into crisis l=
ast year, spirals downward. Its stock has fallen from a high of near $85 to =
$4 Tuesday. A planned rescue-merger is being renegotiated, and Enron's execu=
tives are disgraced.=20
The only shame in this is that 15,000 Enron employees have seen their retire=
ment accounts tank right along with the company stock. We can only wish them=
 luck in their lawsuit filed this week against the company, which urged them=
 right up until the stock crashed to keep buying Enron, then froze the retir=
ement fund so employees couldn't sell their stock while the price skidded. T=
he freeze was billed as an administrative necessity while plan managers were=
 being changed.
Considering that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay made about $145 million on hi=
s stock options in 2000 and the first few months of 2001 alone, maybe he'll =
volunteer to cover some of the $890 million in retirement plan losses. Fat c=
hance. Ditto the nearly $60 million that former Enron President Jeffrey K. S=
killing cleared on his options in 2000. It was Skilling's August resignation=
 that helped trigger Enron's decline--that and disclosures that its executiv=
es had formed off-the-books partnerships that essentially concealed company =
debt.=20
Enron's employees aren't the only ones holding the bag. Enron and its chairm=
an, Lay, essentially invented market trading in electric power. Lay was also=
 a chief energy advisor to President Bush, as he had been to Bush's father. =
Along with a handful of other companies, Enron profited so handsomely from d=
eregulation that California consumers, except those in areas with municipal =
power like Los Angeles, will pay the price in higher electric bills for year=
s. Pacific Gas & Electric declared bankruptcy, and Southern California Ediso=
n nearly did. The state itself is deeply in debt for the power it was forced=
 to buy. Major shareholders in Enron, including the state employee pension f=
und, got burned. There is a lot of blame to pass around--after all, Edison i=
tself was a main cheerleader for deregulation--but Enron remains a fat targe=
t.=20
Lay's tendency to fulminate at the state and its officials at the height of =
the electricity crisis for not getting onto the free-market bandwagon deepen=
ed the wounds. When the price bubble fell victim to this year's cool summer,=
 a declining economy and the state's purchase of long-term power contracts, =
the damage was done.=20
Californians can hope that the Securities and Exchange Commission will requi=
re companies to disclose the sorts of shenanigans that concealed Enron's deb=
t. Voters can ask themselves whether state legislators' inexperience, a prod=
uct of term limits, helped produce such a shoddily constructed deal on dereg=
ulation.=20
Nothing will bring back the ordinary shareholders' lost money. At least the =
Enron employee lawsuit stands a chance of recovering some percentage of the =
retirement fund loss, even if not a penny comes from Kenneth Lay's $145 mill=
ion.

Dynegy Asks Enron for New Terms

Dynegy Inc. is insisting on steeply cutting the price of the $23 billion res=
cue offer it made to energy trading competitor Enron Corp., as the companies=
' executives yesterday continued to hash out financial and legal issues stan=
ding in the way of a new agreement.=20
Dynegy confirmed that it was pressing Enron for new terms, following the lat=
est collapse of Enron's stock price after the companies' original Nov. 9 acq=
uisition agreement.
Neither company would discuss the parameters of a new deal. Dynegy is believ=
ed to be seeking a reduction of about 45 percent in its original offer, whic=
h involved a stock swap and assumption of about $15 billion in Enron debt.=20
More critical than the stock exchange ratio, however, is how Enron will rais=
e more cash and capital to stay solvent over the six to nine months that reg=
ulators are expected to take to review a Dynegy-Enron deal, analysts said. E=
nron has $7 billion in debts that come due over the next 12 months.=20
Under the original deal, Enron shareholders would receive about $10.50 a sha=
re -- more than twice the stock's current market value. Enron shares closed =
yesterday at $4.11, up 10 cents, while Dynegy closed at $40.89, up $1.64.=20
The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported details of the negotiati=
ons on Monday.=20
Enron has little if any leverage, analysts said, predicting that a breakdown=
 in the negotiations could trigger a series of events that would force the n=
ation's largest energy trading firm and champion of deregulation into bankru=
ptcy reorganization.=20
"I don't think they have a choice," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst =
with the Fitch Inc. bond-rating service.=20
Enron's stock -- which traded as high as $84 earlier this year -- plummeted =
after a chain reaction of shocks over the past month tied to Enron's disclos=
ures that some executives were involved in investment partnerships whose deb=
ts were kept off Enron's balance sheet. The Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on launched an investigation of Enron's finances and Enron had to make a $1.=
2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity and acknowledge a $586 million r=
eduction in earnings for the past four years.=20
Ratings services have withheld new assessments of Enron's creditworthiness w=
hile the companies attempt to restructure their deal.=20
The ratings assessments are critical because Enron's debt is now rated just =
one step above junk bond status. If it sinks to that level, lenders could be=
gin demanding repayment on more than $3 billion in Enron debt, precipitating=
 what would likely be a fatal cash drain, analysts said.=20
"Enron's investment grade rating is based in great part on the expectation t=
hat the merger with Dynegy will go forward," Pellecchia said.=20
Growing concerns about Enron's survival have stymied attempts by its bankers=
, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., to raise as much as $2 billion=
 for Enron over the past two weeks. The two banks are prepared to advance $2=
50 million each and are trying to find other lenders willing to advance up t=
o $1.5 billion more, according to sources familiar with the plan.=20
Meanwhile, some companies have avoided selling energy to Enron's trading ope=
ration, fearing they won't be paid.=20
Investors and lenders urgently need a clear signal that Dynegy is determined=
 to proceed, on new terms, Pellecchia and other analysts said. The combinati=
on of the two companies would create a dominant trading operation in energy =
products and related financial instruments, but regulatory reviews are likel=
y to extend for six months or more, and investors want to see whether Dynegy=
 is prepared to stay that course.=20
Another ongoing issue is the mounting lawsuits against Enron by shareholders=
 and employees. Under the merger agreement, Dynegy can walk away if it judge=
s that the successful claims against Enron from such suits will exceed $3.5 =
billion.=20
Several Enron employees have filed suit claiming that the company mismanaged=
 its 401(k) employee retirement plan, which, combined with concealment of it=
s financial problems, has devastated employees' savings.=20
The suit cites Enron's policy that the company's matching contributions woul=
d be made only in Enron stock, and that employees could not sell these share=
s until they reached age 50.=20
Additionally, Enron froze the retirement accounts from the close of trading =
Oct. 26, about the time when the depth of its problems was becoming clear, u=
ntil the morning of Nov. 13, in order to make a planned change in the manage=
ment of the account, a company spokesman said. (The employee lawsuit contend=
s that the freeze covered a slightly longer period.) During the freeze, empl=
oyees could not sell Enron shares that they had purchased as their retiremen=
t contribution.=20
"The message to employees [investing in Enron stock] was, everything was goi=
ng great," said Washington lawyer Eli Gottesdiener, who represents the emplo=
yees in the suit.

Dynegy Refigures Enron Offer Takeover: Buyer lowers price; energy trader's s=

NEW YORK -- The dramatic slide in the stock of energy trader Enron Corp. hal=
ted Tuesday, as its intended rescuer, rival Dynegy Inc., confirmed that it i=
s renegotiating the terms of the takeover.=20
Wall Street read the news as a sign of at least some improvement in the chan=
ces that the deal will go through. But Enron stock rose only 10 cents to $4.=
11 in New York Stock Exchange trading, so confidence in Enron's survivabilit=
y remains tepid, traders said.
Dynegy shares rallied $1.64, or 4%, to $40.89 on the Big Board, as investors=
 anticipated a new deal at a lower price.=20
Reached Tuesday evening, a spokeswoman for Enron said, "We don't expect an a=
nnouncement tonight."=20
The two companies, both based in Houston, have agreed on a new price of 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share, or $6.13 a share at Tuesday's closing pr=
ice for Dynegy, a person familiar with the negotiations said Tuesday. That r=
evalued figure is more than 40% below the original price announced Nov.9.=20
The terms also would include another interim infusion of cash to help stabil=
ize Enron's trading business and enable it to make a $690-million payment du=
e creditors Dec. 14, the person said.=20
He said it was unclear how big the infusion would be and whether the money a=
ll would come from Dynegy and its 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp., or whether=
 a portion would come from Enron's bankers as part of a restructuring of Enr=
on's debt.=20
ChevronTexaco provided Enron an immediate $1.5 billion in cash at the time t=
he takeover was announced. In return, Enron agreed to sell its Northern Natu=
ral Gas Co. pipeline subsidiary to Dynegy.=20
Enron's efforts to attract additional equity investments of up to $2 billion=
 so far have failed. Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that Enron's bankers, l=
ed by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., have had their overtures rejected by Saudi Pr=
ince Alwaleed bin Talal, Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group.=20
The major credit-rating agencies again Tuesday refrained from downgrading En=
ron's bonds to junk status, awaiting word of a restructured deal.=20
Some analysts theorized that, by deferring a downgrade of Enron's bonds to j=
unk status, rating agencies were cutting the company more slack than normal =
because they are conscious that such a downgrade would send the company into=
 bankruptcy. That in turn could cause what one analyst termed a meltdown of =
financial markets, given Enron's long reach in accounting for as much as 25%=
 of all electric power and natural gas traded globally.=20
Ronald M. Barone, analyst at Standard & Poor's rating agency in New York, sa=
id he was surprised no deal was struck as of Tuesday evening. "We're still w=
aiting," he said.=20
Under the terms of some of its controversial deals involving limited partner=
ships established and run by former Enron executives, a rating cut to below =
investment grade would trigger a requirement that Enron make immediate cash =
payments to creditors. Such payments would total $3.9 billion, Enron said in=
 a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
The SEC is investigating the limited-partnership arrangements and the circum=
stances that caused Enron to dramatically restate its official financial sta=
tements, erasing more than $580 million in reported profit since 1997.=20
Enron also faces a raft of lawsuits by ordinary stockholders and by employee=
s who contend they were misled about the firm's financial condition and indu=
ced to invest in company stock when executives knew it was overvalued.=20
Enron's core trading business has been deteriorating as nervous trading part=
ners have reduced their exposure to a possible bankruptcy, said energy analy=
st Michael Heim at A.G. Edwards & Co. in St. Louis.=20
Although Enron's trading volume reportedly has been holding up, reaching as =
much as 80% of normal levels, Heim said such volume mainly represents short-=
term trades.=20
Enron is best-known for long-term, structured trades, which are more complex=
 and far more profitable; those deals are evaporating as Enron's fate remain=
s uncertain, he said.

Ratings agencies agree to hold off on ratings move on Enron for now - WSJ

NEW YORK (AFX) - Representatives of Moody's Investors Service Inc, Standard =
& Poor's Corp and Fitch Inc yesterday agreed to hold off on making any ratin=
gs move on the long-term debt of Enron Corp, which is currently just one not=
ch above junk status, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people close t=
o the talks.=20
The ratings agencies yesterday met with executives of Enron and Dynegy Inc, =
which is trying to buy Enron, as the companies continued talks aimed at salv=
aging their two-week old deal.
A downgrade to junk status would be critical for the troubled Enron, as it w=
ould trigger payment obligations on a large part of its debt, which totals a=
bout 13 bln usd, 9 bln usd of which is due by the end of next year.=20
The company may find itself on the hook for an additional 7 bln usd in off-b=
alance-sheet debt and another 3.9 bln usd in potential liabilities, related =
to troubled investment partnerships, if its credit rating drops to below inv=
estment grade, Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said, according to the paper.=20
It would also make it more expensive for the company to raise the financing =
needed to keep its trading operations alive.=20
Enron yesterday informally agreed to a new share-exchange ratio of 0.12 shar=
es of Dynegy for each Enron share owned, down more than 50 pct from the orig=
inal ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for each Enron share owned, the paper sai=
d.=20
But the new ratio, which values Enron at 4.91 usd a share, or a total of 4.1=
7 bln usd, compared with the original value of 10.98 usd a share, or a total=
 of 9.33 bln usd, has not been officially agreed upon, and talks -- which ar=
e reported to be tense -- are set to continue.=20
The talks began at the weekend, sparked by a steep decline in Enron's share =

Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 28, 2001--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) today announ=
ced the completion of the previously announced acquisition of BG Storage Lim=
ited (BGSL) and its natural gas storage facilities and related assets in the=
 United Kingdom. The transaction has been approved by The Gas and Electricit=
y Markets Authority and The Department of Trade and Industry and has been cl=
eared by the Competition Minister following advice from the Director General=
 of Fair Trading in the UK. Dynegy Europe Limited and BG Group plc (NYSE:BRG=
=2EN) originally announced the signing of a definite agreement with respect =
to the transaction on July 16, 2001.=20
The acquisition of BGSL's 30 wells with five offshore platforms, nine salt c=
averns, approximately 19 miles (32 kilometers) of pipelines and an onshore n=
atural gas processing terminal establishes the cornerstone of Dynegy's Europ=
ean physical energy convergence presence. BGSL's 260 employees will remain e=
mployed under its new name of Dynegy Storage Limited.
"This acquisition strengthens our competitive position in the UK and is a si=
gnificant step toward our long-term goal to replicate our North American ene=
rgy delivery network throughout Europe," said Chuck Watson, chairman and chi=
ef executive officer of Dynegy Inc. "When combined with our marketing, risk =
management and logistics capabilities in the UK, these assets will support t=
he creation of even greater value for our customers and our shareholders."=20
Rough and Hornsea, two of the facilities included in the transaction, are ke=
y providers of physical storage space in the UK natural gas market and are u=
sed by approximately half of the UK's natural gas shippers. The deliverabili=
ty rate of Rough, an offshore depleted natural gas field, is 1.5 billion cub=
ic feet per day (455 GWh/day). The deliverability rate of Hornsea, an onshor=
e salt cavity installation, is 620 million cubic feet per day (195 GWh/day).=
 The two facilities are capable of storing 111 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of n=
atural gas.=20
As part of this transaction, Dynegy also acquired the Easington natural gas =
processing terminal. The facility processes Rough and third-party natural ga=
s streams and delivers into the UK natural gas transportation network. BGSL =
previously announced plans to develop the Aldbrough storage facility, a salt=
 cavern with an expected storage capability of 6 Bcf and deliverability rate=
 of 600 MMcf/day (185 GWh/day). Dynegy Europe will examine the feasibility o=
f Aldbrough's development plans in the future.=20
Dynegy Europe has already consulted with existing and potential customers on=
 enhancements and additions to the storage services and has established an e=
-mail address (storage.consultation@dynegystorage.co.uk) to allow customers =
to provide further views. To request information about storage services, cus=
tomers can also contact Dynegy at inquiry@dynegystorage.co.uk.=20
"We are committed to providing flexible and innovative products to meet the =
special requirements of our new and existing storage customers," said Gary C=
ardone, president of Dynegy Europe. "We are also committed to working with o=
ur customers and incorporating their insight on essential storage needs into=
 our comprehensive product development portfolio."=20
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Dynegy paid approximately $600 mi=
llion (421 million pounds) for BGSL and its assets. Dynegy used a combinatio=
n of cash on hand and short-term borrowings to complete the purchase. The ow=
nership of BGSL is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2002 and beyond.=20
Dynegy Inc. is one of the world's premier energy merchants. Through its glob=
al energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk management capabi=
lities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to customers in North America, =
the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.=20
Through Dynegy Europe, Dynegy has been an active participant in UK energy ma=
rkets since 1994 when it became a leading player in the development of a lib=
eralized natural gas market. In 1999, Dynegy Europe entered the UK and Nord =
Pool electricity markets. With offices in Austria, Switzerland, Holland, Ita=
ly and Spain, Dynegy Europe is one of Europe's largest energy marketers and =
traders and is a significant participant in the communications marketplace.=20
Dynegy Inc. and Enron Corp. recently announced the execution of a definitive=
 agreement for a merger of the two companies. Upon completion of the merger,=
 which is expected by the end of the third quarter 2002, the new Dynegy is e=
xpected to have revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 billion in assets. I=
n addition, the new Dynegy's delivery network will include more than 22,000 =

INDIA: India's ONGC says rejects BG offer on fields.

11/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Nov 28 (Reuters) - India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) ha=
s rejected a bid by British energy giant BG Plc to become the operator of th=
ree prized oil and gas fields off India's west coast, an ONGC spokeswoman sa=
id on Wednesday.=20
The decision could jeopardise the British oil and gas producer's $388-millio=
n deal to buy a 30 percent stake in the fields from U.S. energy firm Enron C=
orp .
The deal, signed in October, was conditional on BG becoming the operator of =
the fields with full control over day-to-day management.=20
The ONGC board, which met late on Tuesday evening, decided that BG's offer w=
as not "sufficiently responsive" for it to become the operator of the fields=
, the spokeswoman told Reuters. She did not elaborate on the reasons for rej=
ecting the BG bid. ONGC's move could also affect Enron, which desperately ne=
eds cash to stave off a mounting debt crisis in the United States. The Houst=
on-based energy trader needs at least $1 billion cash to shore up its balanc=
e sheet and keep rating agencies from junking its debt.=20
The spokesman for BG was not immediately available for comment.=20
The Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, considered one of India's prized discover=
ies in the last two decades, were being jointly owned by ONGC, Enron Oil and=
 Gas India Ltd, wholly-owned unit of Enron Corp, and Reliance Industries Ltd=
 , the country's biggest petrochemicals maker.=20
The Panna-Mukta oilfields have recoverable reserves of 184 million barrels o=
f oil and oil equivalent gas. They are proposed to be expanded to 214 (MMBOE=
). The Tapti gas field has reserves of 96.3 billion cubic metres of gas equi=
valent.=20

MELBOURNE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Renewable power generator Pacific Hydro Ltd sa=
id on Wednesday it expected to select a wind turbine company to set up Austr=
alian manufacturing for its proposed A$300 million Portland wind farm by mid=
-January.=20
Pacific Hydro managing director Jeff Harding said the company had shortliste=
d Danish company NEG Micon and a consortium of Enron Corp and Siemens .
"We will select them within the next six to eight weeks or so, but the manuf=
acturing will only go ahead if we get approval for the project," he said.=20
The selected manufacturer would initially provide turbines for the Portland =
project, but Harding said it was expected to provide the base for other wind=
 project manufacturing.=20
A number of companies are looking at boosting wind generation in Australia a=
s a result of a Federal Government target to boost renewable energy use by t=
wo percent by 2010.=20
Pacific Hydro's Portland project would comprise 120 wind generators with a c=
apacity of about 180 MW, and is expecting to gain environmental approvals ar=
ound April next year.=20
The company, which also has a range of hydro projects in Australia and Asia,=
 has identified 2,991 MW of potential Australian wind generation projects.=20
"We expect to have a minimum of 500 MW operational within three to four year=
s," Harding said.=20
Pacific Hydro is a joint venture partner with Aboitiz in the Phillipines 70 =
MW Bakun hydro project which started operation during the past financial yea=

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron, Dynegy hammer away at new merger deal.
By C. Bryson Hull and Arindam Nag

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. and floundering rival =
Enron Corp. hammered away at new terms for their proposed merger late Tuesda=
y, and sources said talks included a buyout offer half the original price an=
d fervent efforts to secure financing to stave off a credit downgrade.=20
The sources familiar with the negotiations said investment banks J.P. Morgan=
 and Citigroup, who are advisors and have already loaned Enron a total of $1=
 billion, may have to step up with a combined $500 million to help save the =
deal.
This follows several rebuffs of Enron by prominent private equity firms, alt=
hough a source said the Houston company was entertaining an offer of $1 bill=
ion from outside investors.=20
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is c=
urrently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial recor=
ds that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday.=20
The first buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about=
 $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to n=
ear $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through.=20
It is abundantly clear that the deal will be changed if it is to proceed. So=
urces close to the negotiations said the stock exchange ratio is likely to f=
all into the range of 0.12 to 0.15 Dynegy shares for each Enron share, about=
 half of the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 to 1.=20
Enron had tentatively accepted the lower end of that range, but a source cau=
tioned that the talks were still very active and the terms very fluid.=20
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt pas=
t the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002, as another=
 move against a credit cut.=20
OUTSIDE OFFER ENTERTAINED=20
As for the outside offer of $1 billion, a source said the investment is desi=
gned to shore up Enron's balance sheet and keep rating agencies from junking=
 its credit. A credit downgrade would cause some $3.9 billion in obligations=
 to become due immediately.=20
"It's all about getting money to protect assets and intellectual property," =
the source told Reuters.=20
An announcement could come as early as Wednesday, but it could take longer, =
the source said.=20
The source declined to identify the parties, and would neither confirm or de=
ny that Goldman Sachs was among them. Sources close to the investment bank h=
ave told Reuters recently that Goldman is looking at ways to be part of Enro=
n's power trading business.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on what he termed speculatio=
n about parties to the deal.=20
Enron's shares bounced slightly on Tuesday after Dynegy confirmed the restru=
cturing talks. Shares closed up 13 cents at $4.14 on the New York Stock Exch=
ange. Dynegy's shares gained 4.2 percent or $1.64 to $40.89 on the NYSE.=20
Another set of clouds darkening Enron's sky is the fact that its pursuit of =
private equity financing has found few takers among the more prominent priva=
te equity firms.=20
Three New York-based buyout firms, Blackstone Group, Clayton Dubilier & Rice=
 and Warburg Pincus LLC have all passed on Enron, according to people famili=
ar with Enron's efforts.=20
And Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle Group, another major private equity firm,=
 is also not interested in Enron, Carlyle spokesman Chris Ullman said.=20
Some private equity executives who have looked at Enron say too much remains=
 unclear about Enron's financial condition to commit funds in the near futur=
e.=20
One certainty is that layoffs are in Enron's future. Three sources confirmed=
 to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit is being closed and that the ro=
ughly 60 employees there are being laid off. An Enron spokesman would not co=
mment on the cuts.=20
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyou=
t, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its trading f=
ranchise, the crown jewel most coveted by Dynegy. Enron's trading partners h=
ave been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trade=
r because of credit concerns.=20
"This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the p=
rincipal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less, th=
en Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading =
and marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade.=20

That would value Enron at dlrs 4.17 billion. The original deal, valued at dl=
rs 9.3 billion, was based on an exchange rate of 0.2685 Dynegy share for eac=
h Enron share.=20
As a condition of the reduced price, Enron executives were seeking more cont=
rol of the combined company, the Journal said.=20
Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright said the buyout will hinge on Dyne=
gy's ability to reinvigorate Enron's trading operation, which has been hurt =
as some energy companies have stopped selling it power and natural gas for f=
ear they won't be paid.=20
Many energy traders who have shied away from doing business with Enron worry=
 that the company will go bankrupt, said Charlie Sanchez, energy markets man=
ager for Gelber & Associates, a Houston-based energy trading firm.=20
Restoring customer and investor faith "is not impossible. But it's more of a=
n issue of gradually rebuilding (Enron's) confidence and legacy and developi=
ng confidence in the new legacy under Dynegy. It's just going to take time,"=
 he said.=20
But Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock & Co. Inc. said Enron is a bad i=
nvestment and that Dynegy underestimated its potential liabilities after it =
announced Nov. 9 that it would buy the company at a price valuing Enron at a=
bout dlrs 10 per share. Under the terms of the deal, Dynegy also would assum=
e dlrs 13 billion in Enron debt.=20
"Chasing Enron is like trying to catch a falling knife," Gheit wrote Tuesday=
 in a research note to investors.=20
Stengel, the Dynegy spokesman, declined comment when asked if an announcemen=
t of renegotiated terms is expected soon. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said t=
he company had no comment about any discussions related to the merger and th=
at Enron expected the deal to be completed.=20
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares rose 10 cents to clo=

Enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowe=

USA: Enron woes bite into its energy trading.
By James Jelter

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Former energy trading giant Enron's financ=
ial straits and plunging share price are drying up its core business as othe=
r market players seek out safer trading partners.=20
While most U.S. utilities and trading houses say they are still striking dea=
ls with Enron, they also admit now to slashing their financial exposure to t=
he battered company.
"We haven't stopped trading with Enron," said Terry Francisco, a spokesman f=
or rival Duke Energy .=20
"We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make prudent adjustme=
nts when necessary in accordance with our credit policies," he added.=20
For Enron, those policies are starting to sting.=20
The company has seen its credit rating cut to just above "junk" status follo=
wing disclosure of off-balance sheet dealings by a senior officer and a down=
ward revision of its earnings for the past four years.=20
Enron, which until recently handled 20 percent of the North American electri=
city and natural gas market, has seen its share price plummet from a year hi=
gh of $84.88 to close today at a mere $4.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. agreed earlier this month to buy Enron in a sto=
ck deal valued at $10.55 a share.=20
But given Enron shares' continued slump, Dynegy said Tuesday it was seeking =
to renegotiate the deal.=20
DEARTH OF SELLERS=20
Amid all this bad news, energy traders said they were now reluctant to sell =
energy to Enron.=20
This, in turn, has raised concerns Enron might have a hard time securing eno=
ugh power and gas to meet its long-term sales commitments, though there so f=
ar has been no evidence it has missed any deliveries or failed to pay for wh=
at it buys.=20
Nevertheless, Mirant Corp. , another of the nation's top energy trading hous=
es, confirmed Tuesday it was no longer willing to sell energy products to En=
ron.=20
"Right now, we're just purchasing from them," Mirant spokesman Chuck Griffin=
 said.=20
This cautionary approach was also confirmed at several municipal and federal=
 power companies, including the mighty Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)=
 in Portland, Oregon.=20
"We have severely limited our business with Enron," said Stephen Oliver, vic=
e president of power marketing for BPA, which sells wholesale electricity fr=
om a string of huge dams along the Northwest's Columbia River.=20
Oliver said BPA, which has done business with Enron for six years, owes the =
company money but he declined to say how much.=20
"We have zeroed out their credit limit, and any business going forward with =
Enron would be within the amount of money owed to them," he said.=20
PAYMENT UP FRONT=20
Enron's shaky financial status has prompted some traders to demand payment u=
p front, a move taken by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), which=
 markets hydroelectricity from 56 federal dams for the U.S. Department of En=
ergy.=20
WAPA spokeswoman LaVerne Kyriss said some of their regional offices have hal=
ted spot market dealings with Enron and are seeking to renegotiate a 10-year=
 deal to buy power from Enron.=20
"We are working to protect our utility customers and the federal government,=
" Kyriss said.=20
Traders throughout the utility industry said they had curbed or dropped long=
-term trades with Enron, which involve deals lasting anywhere from a week to=
 several years.=20
As Enron's financial woes deepen, traders said they are searching for "sleev=
es", or middlemen, to provide a financial buffer in brokered spot market dea=
ls with the company.=20
In such a deal, a utility, for example, will offer to sell its surplus elect=
ricity or gas through a broker, trusting the broker to line up the best anon=
ymous bid in the market.=20
If the top bidder turns out to be Enron, many utilities will turn down the d=
eal unless they have a middleman willing to take ownership and guarantee pay=
ment of the energy being sold.=20
This allows a utility trader to indirectly conduct business with Enron while=
 staying within the utility's credit limits.=20
TAKING A TOLL=20
The toll all this is taking on Enron's business is hard to measure.=20
Enron, like most trading houses, does not disclose its market positions or h=
ow much of its activity is wrapped up at any given time in natural gas or el=
ectricity - its two biggest markets - or its other energy and financial tran=
sactions.=20
"We don't break things out by type of product," Enron spokesman Eric Thode s=
aid.=20
Thode said the company had seen a drop in trading volume, about 60 percent o=
f which is conducted over its prized EnronOnline Internet trading system and=
 40 percent in the over-the-counter market.=20
But the company's 30-day rolling trade average showed Enron was doing about =
5,400 transactions a day, with a daily notional value of $2.8 billion, which=
 is well within its daily average of 4,700 to 5,700 transactions this year.=20
"Certainly, our volumes have dropped below our 30-day rolling average ... bu=
t confidence is still being shown by the great majority of our trading partn=
ers," Thode said.

But this unhappy situation with Enron, this is like a soap opera that just g=

YOUNGBERG: Well, I think they may announce some sort of restructuring. You k=

=20
talking of having the company, Enron, surviving for another nine months or s=

all that risk?=20
YOUNGBERG: Well, I think Dynagy, you know, has to be evaluating that. You kn=
ow, the thing they`re buying here as far as assets is really -- are really t=
he people and the trading=20
floor. The pipelines they`re acquiring, which are good pipelines, but they h=
ave a lot of debt against them.=20
So, you know, they have to decide, you know, is this worth continuing to pur=

the debt they would take on, we were just -- Casey Wian in Houston just talk=

there`s, you know, legal ramifications. I guess that`s another liability tha=

YOUNGBERG: Right. I think Dynagy has already looked at -- you know, they ass=
ume that=20
there will be some significant litigation, you know, issues and losses, poss=

The question is, you know, is there something=20
more out there that we don`t know, and maybe even Dynagy itself doesn`t know=
?=20
FRANCIS: Is there another potential acquirer out there, or is Dynagy the acq=
uirer of the last resort for (inaudible)...=20
YOUNGBERG: I really=20
do believe that Dynagy is really the only party that`s really that intereste=

now with an SEC investigation, possible further losses, a declining share in=

There`s just too much for, I think, most other companies to really take on. =
And if=20
any company knows the insides of Enron, I think it would probably be Dynagy =
at this point in time.=20
HAYS: (inaudible), you know, this is -- I can`t think of anything to offset =
any of=20
this, because everything you say, it`s hard to find an argument against.=20
In fact, if anything, you`d think Dynagy would be better off to wait until t=
hey`re in bankruptcy proceedings and then buy=20
whatever pieces of the company are on the block.=20
FRANCIS: Or just steal the customers.=20
HAYS: Yes.=20
YOUNGBERG: Well, I think the problem with waiting for them to go into bankru=
ptcy, and Dynagy has to weigh this=20
also, is that you get in that situation, you don`t know what the bankruptcy =
judge could decide in those situations. There could be other parties that, y=
ou know, partake in the bidding=20
for the pipelines, for example. You know, they may not get all the assets th=

Enron Board Agrees to Lower Dynegy Purchase Price, Paper Says
2001-11-27 23:43 (New York)


     Houston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s board agreed to
a reduced Dynegy Inc. purchase offer that values the energy
trader's equity at $4.17 billion, less than half of the original
price, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a personal
familiar with the plan.

     The new exchange ratio of 0.12 share of Dynegy for each Enron
share would value Enron at $4.91 a share, the Journal said. That's
19 percent above Enron's closing stock price today and down from
the original ratio of 0.2685. The agreement isn't final, the paper
said.

     Enron and Dynegy executives are trying to save the
transaction amid growing concern about Enron's cash-flow problems.
Enron shares have fallen 95 percent this year as investors
questioned whether the company was using affiliated partnerships
to hide losses and debt, and some lenders stopped providing Enron
with cash.

     In exchange for a lower purchase price, some at Enron are
seeking more control over the combined company, the Journal said.

     Dynegy is prepared to invest at least $500 million in Enron,
on top of the $1.5 billion in cash from Dynegy investor
ChevronTexaco Corp., the New York Times said, citing executives
close to the talks. Dynegy wants the cash backed by assets, and
the companies are having a hard time finding enough Enron holdings
that aren't already mortgaged to creditors, the paper said.

Enron Finding It Harder to Trade, Competitors Say (Update2)

     (Adds Magnum Hunter comment in 21st-23rd paragraphs.)

     Houston, Nov. 27, (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is finding it
harder to buy natural gas or power because some trading partners
have lost confidence the company will have the cash to pay bills,
spokesmen for other energy companies say.

     Mirant Corp. traders won't sell natural gas or power to
Enron, though the Atlanta-based energy trader will buy from the
company, said James Peters, Mirant spokesman. Aquila Inc.'s
business with Enron also is ``all on the buy side,'' said Al
Butkus, an Aquila spokesman.

     Dynegy is in talks to lower the price of its acquisition of
Enron from its current $23 billion in stock and assumed debt. The
talks are a sign that the trading operations, which provide more
than 90 percent of Enron's revenue, are in trouble, analysts say.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel -- its marketing and trading business -- is
deteriorating,'' said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank
Securities.

     Enron spokesman Eric Thode said Enron's trading operations
remain strong. Volume on EnronOnline, the company's Internet-based
trading site, has averaged 5,400 transactions a day with a value
of $2.8 billion over the last 30 days. EnronOnline handles about
60 percent of the company's trading business, Thode said.

                      Paying Higher Premiums

     Companies that continue to do business with Enron are forcing
it to pay premium prices, said Arthur Gelber, president of Gelber
& Associates Corp. in Houston, which advises 18 producers on their
trading strategies.

     Companies are charging Enron about $1.72 for a million
British thermal units of natural gas, where they would charge a
buyer with better credit $1.70, Gelber said.

      Profit margins on energy sales are slim, and ``it's very
difficult'' for Enron's traders to turn a profit if they have to
pay more than competitors, Gelber said.

     Other sellers are requiring Enron to provide large letters of
credit showing it has the cash to complete a deal, Gelber said. A
typical natural gas deal, such as a delivery of 10 billion British
thermal units a day for a month, might require a letter of credit
for as much as $690,000.

     Competitors don't face some of the problems that Enron does
guaranteeing trades, analysts said, because they have their own
power plants and natural gas supplies to meet commitments. Enron
has few such assets, and must purchase most of its supplies.

     ``We're seeing the repercussion of Enron's strategy that had
been so unorthodox -- for them to not rely on physical generation
assets,'' said Will McNamara, director of electric industry
analysts at consultant Scientech Inc.

      ``Because they don't have their own assets to rely on,
they've got to go out and get the power from somebody else,''
which is becoming more difficult and expensive because of the
company's credit problems, McNamara said.

                         Lowering Exposure

     Some partners have long-term contracts with Enron and don't
want it to fail until they can find alternative suppliers or hedge
existing contracts, traders say.

     ``Most people want Enron to survive for a certain amount of
time to get their exposure down,'' said Mike Loya, president of
Vitol SA, a closely held energy company with offices in Houston.
``We continue to trade with Enron cautiously.''

     Companies that are buying from Enron may be doing so to
offset agreements to sell back to the company later, a technique
for reducing the potential losses if a partner fails to meet its
obligations, traders said.

                          Shares Declined

     Enron shares have fallen 95 percent this year as the
investors questioned whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to hide losses and debt, and some lenders stopped
providing Enron with cash.

     Enron shares rose 13 cents to $4.14 today, down from a high
of $84.63 on Dec. 28. Dynegy rose $1.64 to $40.89, down 4.3
percent from Nov. 9 when the merger was announced. Shares of
ChevronTexaco, which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 42 cents to
$85.62.

     In October, the company said shareholder equity was lowered
by $1.2 billion because it used stock to pay off a partnership's
debt. On Nov. 8, the company lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586
million to reflect losses incurred by the partnerships.

    Last week, Enron said it may be forced to pay a $690 million
note owed by one of the partnerships and may write off $700
million in the fourth quarter to reflect a debt it is backing for
another partnership with stock.

                               Debt

    Enron is trying to renegotiate more than $9 billion in debt
payments owed before the end of 2002, as well as secure as much as
$2 billion from outside investors who will take a stake in the
company. Without more money, Enron may run short of cash it needs
to guarantee trades, analysts say.

     Credit concerns prompted Magnum Hunter Resources Inc., an oil
and natural gas producer in Irving, Texas, to stop selling gas to
Enron from the largest producing property it controls in the Gulf
of Mexico.

     The company is still selling gas to Enron from two smaller
properties, with the purchases backed by letters of credit,
because Enron was one of the few companies willing to give small
companies credit a few years ago, when oil and gas prices were
low.

     ``We have always appreciated them standing by us when
commodity prices were low,'' said Magnum Hunter Chief Financial
Officer Chris Tong.

     Some large industrial natural gas and electricity users are
avoiding signing long-term contracts with Enron, industry
consultants said.

     ``Why would you go with a supplier where there's uncertainty,
when you can go with one where there's certainty?'' asked Mark
Boyer, chief operating officer of Summit Energy Services Inc. in
Louisville, Kentucky, which advises metals, chemical and paper
companies on their energy-purchasing decisions.
