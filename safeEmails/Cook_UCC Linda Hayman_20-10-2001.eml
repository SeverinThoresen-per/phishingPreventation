I had a good visit with her on the issues.  She advised that she is on a tas=
k force to add amendments to the revised 9 in Delaware and thought the group=
 might entertain favorably an exception for master netting agreements from t=
he anti-restriction/assignment receivable issue.  She will work on this for =
us if we want her to.  I think we should--at least it would be a start and a=
n example.  Do you think there would be great risk in applying Delaware law =
to the master netting agreements rather than New York?  Let's talk.  Call me=
 Monday.

Cordially,
