As you are aware, legal is coordinating with the trading/origination groups =
in handling consensual termination transactions of our in-the-money position=
s with counterparties that are willing to do so.   Could you please spread t=
he word that these transactions should NOT be done by entering into offsetti=
ng trades, but rather by entering into a Termination Agreement with our coun=
terparty and the counterparty paying to Enron the agreed upon value.  Thanks=
