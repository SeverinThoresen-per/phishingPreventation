Leslie:
It is my understanding that settlement payments are due tomorrow for EPMI tr=
ades done with the following counterparties:

El Paso Electric Company
LG&E Energy Marketing Inc.
Great Bay Power Corporation
Niagra Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc.


EPMI is holding LC's that expire 12/31/01 as collateral.  Please advise me A=
SAP as soon as you know whether payment has been made as we may have a right=
 to draw prior to the expiry date.

Is anyone aware of any other deafults that would give us a right to draw?
