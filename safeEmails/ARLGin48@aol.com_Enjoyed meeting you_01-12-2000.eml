Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more o=
f
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

Alice Ginsburgh
