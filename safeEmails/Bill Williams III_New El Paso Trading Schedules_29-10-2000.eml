would mean that they take the phones over at 6:30 PST and return them to us=20
at 14:30 PST.  EPE Marketing believes that this time change will allow them=20
to be better prepared when they begin trading, and will provide better flow=20
when we hand over the phone.  If you have questions or comments concerning=20
the future of this change, please voice them.

Bill
