This will just be Rome and Enron.  Although we believe that most of his clai=
ms really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that Enron used HMS to def=
raud Rome.  His lawsuit will be against only Enron.  Therefore, it makes no =
sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have =
to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed). =20

on?  Hanover Compressor, Hanover Measurement, etc.

I have spoken with Kevin on this.  Rome's attorney has asked for a mediation=
 with Gary McGowan, who is an outstanding mediator.  We have agreed.  My par=
alegal, Diane Goode, will be calling you to schedule the mediation time as w=
ell as time for a preparation meeting.  I am in the process of preparing a c=
hronology of events for you and Kevin, since he said that you should be the =
one involved in such a mediation.

If, prior to that, you would like to engage Rome in settlement discussions d=
irectly, feel free to do so.  I doubt that he will want to talk about it wit=
hout his lawyer.

He still is an employee, but his deadline for redeployment is 10/31, at whic=
h time his employment will be terminated.  We will continue to honor his con=
tract and pay him through the end of the Term, although he will not remain a=
n employee of Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle
