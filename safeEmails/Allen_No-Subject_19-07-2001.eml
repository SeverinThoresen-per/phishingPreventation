Greg,

I have been working with Bill Montez.  I furnished a personal financial stat=
ement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.  I am pulling t=
ogether the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let m=
e know what else I need to do.

I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.=
  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near =
a PVR of 1". =20

Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darr=
ell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to =
Bank One just in case?

Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.

Talk to you soon.

Phillip
