Can you handle this?  I do not have Sitara access.

Thanks,
Greg

We stopped serving Midland Cogen on Sitara deals 340305 and 332163 effective=
 4/1/2002.  There are trigger prices on both of these deals which automatica=
lly generates an invoice whether we physically serve the deal or not (see in=
voice number 36538SA for April 2002 production).  For April 2002, these deal=
s are generating a credit invoice in the amount of $390,748.50.  I would lik=
e to take the trigger volumes to 0 effective 4/1/2002 for the term of the de=
al to see if this reverses out the credit created in April and keeps us from=
 sending out a credit invoice in the future.

Let me know if this is an issue? =20

Thanks.
