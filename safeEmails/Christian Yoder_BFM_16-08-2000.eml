Two things:

1.  Send these sentence to the Cal Px:

"Enron thinks that the elimination of physical risk during the month of=20
August will be of commercial benefit because Enron expects that during the=20
month of August there will be transmission line derations affecting the hour=
=20
ahead market which will lead to TO debit charges by the CAISO.   The=20
elimination of  TO debit charges is a commercial benefit to Enron. "

I will call them and discuss this with them when I get back on next Tuesday.

2.  Do not do any financial BF trades in September.  Let's sort it back=20
through with them.  The letter is surprising and we need to figure out why=20
they sent it.  One month of financial at 50% is ok, but lets not do any more=
=20
till we talk to them. ----cgy
