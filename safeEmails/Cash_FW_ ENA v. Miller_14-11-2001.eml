Dear  Michelle:
=20
    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine=
),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller wit=
h  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made =
at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  conce=
rns.  She made the following points:
        =20
         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  lev=
els of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats =
 the power grids as "completely different" regions, strategies for which are=
 not  shared internally among those regions.   =20
=20
         (2)    She asserts that "how we do it at Calpine is totally  differ=
ent from Enron," since Calpine is "trading around a portfolio of assets  tha=
t we own."  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  tr=
ades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  ass=
ets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  v=
astly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  gener=
ation assets.
=20
         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  "Urcot" =
(sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   Accordin=
g to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorce=
d from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East=
 or West. =20
=20
         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller "is not senior enough  tha=
t we would be looking for what he knows."  He has no role whatsoever in  dis=
cussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  th=
e receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely i=
n response to orders he receives from others.
=20
         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  respon=
sible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the=
 tables turned.  Miller is "so slotted," however, that she believes that  he=
 is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (=
though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  =
critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to=
-day  basis).
=20
       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:
=20
        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-t=
rading function for a  period of two months or so. =20
=20
                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only ar=
ea for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that =
she could  explore putting him instead in the West ("I know Enron doesn't ev=
en have a  western desk here.").  I believe that any proposal she comes back=
  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.
=20
        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assuranc=
es (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is "on the receiving end only," as she a=
sserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position=
 to use any trade  secrets he may remember.
  =20
                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either wha=
t level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feas=
ible  alternative.
    =20
         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  informatio=
n about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Mil=
ler's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secret=
s.
=20
                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really k=
new the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about =
the activities of this  low level person.
=20
     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to =
 these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.
=20
     Thanks for your assistance.

Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks
