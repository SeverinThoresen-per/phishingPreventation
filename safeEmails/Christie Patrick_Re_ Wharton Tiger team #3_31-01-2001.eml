Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth=20
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be=
=20
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in=20
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron=20
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference=20
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to=20
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower=20
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk=20
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see i=
f=20
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a=20
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next=20
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm=20
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help yo=
u=20
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his=20
expectations.

Thanks,

Enron Team 3 (Retail)
