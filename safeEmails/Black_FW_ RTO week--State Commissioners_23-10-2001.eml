Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners =
to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in t=
he decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state c=
ommissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 2=
7 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame=
=2E  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some=
 of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts.=20

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged =
them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came=
 from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Eve=
ryone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that t=
hey had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and =
there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In partic=
ular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly ch=
arged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negati=
ve (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was s=
imiliar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressi=
ng the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she h=
ad taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryla=
nd commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or hones=
t as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way ove=
rboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at th=
e meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary =
record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that =
she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounte=
d but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe=
 that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never =
coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current =
statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if t=
hey do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commi=
ssions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but=
 sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for =
consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame t=
hey had to respond to the order. =20

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different,=
 how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the F=
ERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were.=20

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representin=
g the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washingto=
n commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we'v=
e been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc et=
c.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked ab=
out how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into t=
he new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in =
green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very =
supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated tha=
t for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance. =20

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svand=
a's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was neces=
sary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that r=
egulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very len=
gthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said =
"FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what th=
ey are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Hu=
elsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative co=
mmentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling=
 conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


=46rom the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  Afte=
r hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that th=
ey had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated =
that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there h=
as been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....y=
ou've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments o=
r the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599
