Kathy,

Cindy was contacted by the Greater Houston Partnership.  A New York-based fi=
nancial company is considering relocating nearly 400 jobs to Houston due pri=
marily to the influx of Enron talent to the market.  The Partnership has ask=
ed Cindy to present to this group tomorrow, Thursday, evening.  One piece of=
 information they are asking for is a demographic breakdown of the people we=
 terminated.  I was wondering if we could pull together numbers by job class=
ification and level.  Here's what I invision:

Number of Employees Let Go 		Total: 4,500

	Trading				# 		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Financial			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Technical			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Professional			#		(# By professions included)
	Administrative			#		(# Broken out by level)
	Other				#

I'll put it into a PowerPoint slide for Cindy's presentation, but could I ge=
t the data (even if it is very rough) by about noon tomorrow?

Kathy, I know how many unreasonable requests you've had to put up with over =
the past few months.  I hope that this isn't another one.  Forgive me and se=
t me straight if this can't be done.

Thank you,
Terrie
