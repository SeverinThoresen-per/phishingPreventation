Alan,
=20
 This will confirm your instructions that for the time being, I will be=20
reporting to you and the other above-referenced people.  I also understand=20
that David Best and I will not be further involved in development of a=20
resolution of the ECT/FGH agreement issues, and will confine our efforts to=20
resolution of the cargo contamination matter.  Per you instructions, in orde=
r=20
to keep from inundating Janice Moore (who will be working on the ECT/FGH=20
agreement issues) with e-mails, I will not be reporting to her for the time=20
being.

 The following are action/status items:

1. ACTION:  I would like to have your authority today for Best to retain as=20
ECT's chemist in the contamination matter Steve Jones of APC Consultants, wh=
o=20
is based in London.  Jones is reportedly well-regarded in the London legal=20
community, makes a good witness, and has the right background for this kind=20
of matter.  I am told that the best available chemist in Singapore has a=20
background more oriented to fire investigation cases.  Jones charges a daily=
=20
rate of 725-755 pounds per day, which David relates is very reasonable for=20
his services. =20

 Best will be sending Jones relevant documentation to review at the opening=20
of business tomorrow in London, with the plan of then getting Jones'=20
preliminary advice on Wednesday, including the critical element of the=20
testing procedure to be used at the joint analysis that is being scheduled=20
for Singapore next week.  If it proves to be our best strategy to have Jones=
=20
attend the joint analysis in Singapore, Jones will undoubtedly be charging=20
transit time in addition to his expenses.=20

 I think that this case may boil down to a "battle of the experts" and that=20
it is important to have our "first team" in place before the joint analysis,=
=20
whose results may critically affect our case.

2. STATUS:  On a related matter, we are still in the process of determining=20
what damages ECT has sustained in this cargo contamination case over and=20
above the approximately $300,000 diminution in value sustained with respect=20
to the product that was discharged in the Phillipines.  As you know, the bul=
k=20
of the product had earlier been discharged in Thailand, where it remains in=20
storage.  That product had not been nominated by FGH at the time of=20
discharge, but I believe it was the case that it was supposed to meet FGH's=20
specs in case FGH wanted to nominate it (Matt, please correct me if I am=20
wrong).  I believe that ECT's traders are still trying to arrange for the=20
disposition of that cargo.  I would not be surprised if ECT's contamination=20
claim approximately doubled once the Thailand cargo is ultimately disposed=20
of, although at this point I am really just speculating.

3. STATUS:  Matt asked Best what he thought the approximate cost would be to=
=20
ECT of arbitrating this cargo contamination case.  Based on an arbitration=20
that Best thought would last at least one week, and not including any=20
pre-arbitration  development, Best gave a rough, preliminary estimate of=20
125,000 pounds.  Best mentioned that if ECT won (which means that ECT both=20
recovered on its cargo contamination claim and was found ultimately not to=20
owe any unpaid freight or demurrage), ECT would likely be awarded=20
approximately 2/3's of his fees, and a larger share of his expenses (such as=
=20
the barrister's fees, the fees of our surveyor's, etc.). =20

4. STATUS:  the statement of Eric Tan and a colleague involved in discussion=
s=20
with Mitsubishi regarding tank washing will be taken by us shortly.

 I will continue to keep you closely advised.  Please don't hesitate to call=
=20
if you have any instructions.


        Britt  =20
