Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve
