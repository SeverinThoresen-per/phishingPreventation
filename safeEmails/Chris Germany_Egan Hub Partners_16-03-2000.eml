Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't=
=20
have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have=20
copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA=20
which is good enough for me.

I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless=
=20
someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to=20
Sylvia. =20

Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also,=20
the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it u=
p=20
that way.
Let me know if you have questions.

thanks
