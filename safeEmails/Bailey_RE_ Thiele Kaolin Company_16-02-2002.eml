Sara,

As in our past exercises for the "Non-Terminated/In-the-Money" Counterpartie=
s, the Thiele-Kaolin Company continues to appear as a "financial" trading re=
lationship.

However, according to the Confirmation Desk there are only physical arrangem=
ents with this counterparty (as evidenced by our GTC docs).  I hope that Cre=
dit can resolve the mystery???

We cannot locate any financial contracts for this counterparty.

Please verify that this party belongs on the ITM Non-terminated financial ga=
s list.
