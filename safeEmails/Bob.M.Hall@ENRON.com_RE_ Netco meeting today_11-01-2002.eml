Subject:	Netco meeting today

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info=
 ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them =
buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

bob
