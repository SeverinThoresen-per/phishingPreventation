I guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan =
will look like.  Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.=

The answers so far have stated current Enron Corp Severance Plans are in pla=
ce for those employees laid off.

What are the Enron Corp Severance Plan details? Where can they be found?

Thanks
