Vladi, amigo ruso, de verdad:

=BFHow are you doing my friend? I hope everything is cool with you. I`ve tri=
ed to catch you in the chat today
(just a few minutes ago) but you were not available. Ok, the purpose of this=
 e-mail is to wish you the best in
this coming year, I know things are not easy right now and things are changi=
ng quickly for you, but you are an
incredible person and God (if you believe in God, but if you dont, it doesnt=
 matter) save good and nice things
for good people like you. I know i havent been a good friend the last months=
 (for various reasons i explained
to you over the phone last time) but you are the best friend I ever had (is =
serious, no just a phrase) and i
want for you just the best in this year and in the years to come. I promise =
to be in touch.

Your friend

Christian
