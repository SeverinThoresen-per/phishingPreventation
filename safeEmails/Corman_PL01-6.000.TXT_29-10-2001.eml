                         William L. Massey, Linda Breathitt,

     Extraordinary Expenditures

                            STATEMENT OF POLICY

                        (Issued September 14, 2001)

          In light of tragic events that have taken place in our
     country this week and the high state of alert the country is now
     experiencing, the Commission believes it is appropriate to
     provide regulatory guidance on certain energy infrastructure
     reliability and security matters that may be affected by this
     Commission's rate jurisdiction.  The Commission understands that
     electric, gas, and oil companies may need to adopt new
     procedures, update existing procedures, and install facilities to
     further safeguard their electric power transmission grid and gas
     and oil pipeline systems.  The Commission is aware that there may
     be uncertainty about companies' ability to recover the expenses
     necessary to further safeguard our energy infrastructure,
     especially if they are operating under frozen or indexed rates.=20
     In order to alleviate this uncertainty, the Commission wants to
     assure the companies we regulate that we will approve
     applications to recover prudently incurred costs necessary to
     further safeguard the reliability and security of our energy
     supply infrastructure in response to the heightened state of
     alert.  Companies may propose a separate rate recovery mechanism,
     such as a surcharge to currently existing rates or some other
     cost recovery method.

          The Commission will give its highest priority to processing
     any filing made for the recovery of extraordinary expenditures to
     safeguard the reliability of our energy transportation systems
     and energy supply infrastructure.  The Commission views the
     reliability of our Nation's energy transportation systems and
     energy supply infrastructure as critical to meeting the energy
     requirements essential to the American people.  The Commission
     calls for the cooperation of the energy industry, customers, and
     state and local governments to provide any additional safeguards
     necessary to protect the country's vital energy transportation
     systems and energy supply infrastructure.
