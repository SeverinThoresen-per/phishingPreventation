Janine: Please provide an update of your progress on this issue.

Also, if the research being conducted is specific to the relationship betwee=
n=20
Enron Japan Corp and RMT, can we explore the possiblility of rolling this=20
product out for USD and ECU and only allow RMT and EEFT as agent for RMT to=20
trade, then add JPY and EJC as agent for RMT once your examination is=20
complete?

Stuart and Shane:  could either or both of you please provide me with the=20
trading hours that each of the Tokyo, London, and Houston trading desk will=20
be offering these Product online, to include any time overlaps or time gaps.

Also, please take a look at the Products I've created in TEST and see if the=
y=20
meet your expectations.

Dale

Tax:
The Enron entity executing the FX transaction as principal is ENA.=20

However, note that for tax/legal the FX desk in London is run by Enron Europ=
e=20
Finance & Trading Limited ("EEFT") as agent for ENA. Our position is that EN=
A=20
does not have a place of business in London. Therefore all the transactions=20
managed by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA.

Because of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the=20
transaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and=20
logoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility. This would=20
enable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which=

Subject: FX Issues


This e-mail is admittedly long, so I have classified the issues:

Legal/Tax Issue:

I have been told by the FX group here in Houston that London traders are abl=
e=20
to act on the behalf of the US FX Desk because the transactions they do are=20
for hedging purposes only (no proprietary trading). For example, the FX=20
transactions that are done by Trena McFarland in London are done on the=20
behalf of our Houston office, so Houston books the transaction, manages the=20
risk, and writes the Confirmation in the name of ENA.

This being the case, (i) can we apply the same logic on the internal FX=20
transactions that will be managed by both the US and UK traders and have the=
=20
transacting entity as ENA (ii) if we do does it gives us the necessary tax=20
relief, or (iii) should we stick the Metals structure where the transactions=
=20
are offered by Enron North America, acting through it's agent, Enron Europe=20
Finance and Trading Limited. While this may be an Internal Only Product Type=
=20
today, what effect, if any, would the choice of trading entities have on our=
=20
ability to offer these Products externally.

Technology Issue:

David - Stuart has explained to me that the US FX Desk now views these=20
currency exchange products as financial products. This is contrary to=20
previous discussions where we felt that any currency exchange involving an=20
Index would be considered financial, while any 'strict exchange' would be=20
considered a physical transaction. The change is based on conversations=20
Stuart has had with the Metals traders wherein they would like to see this=20
exchange product as a financial product. If we accept this logic, (i) do I=20
need to create a Deal Type for 'Par Forward Swap' for the first FX Index=20
Product Type that we did as well as a 'Forward Swap' for these transactions,=
=20
or is it acceptable to leave these both as swaps, and (ii) regardless of the=
=20
Deal Type classification discussed in (i), I will need to create a new=20
Product Type for the 'strict exchange' - either as a physical or financial=20
product. Additionally, if I set this up as Financial Product, I have the=20
Index attribute in the template to contend with, because there is no Index;=20
and if I set this up as a Physical Product, I have the Location attribute to=
=20
contend with, because there is no Location. Naturally we can put something=20
cheesy in to fill the gap since it's internal, but if we ever decide to go=20
external we will need a new template - and from experience with the PJM Powe=
r=20
(Weather Desk) Product Type, templates requires an 'and if' statement are=20
hard to develop.
