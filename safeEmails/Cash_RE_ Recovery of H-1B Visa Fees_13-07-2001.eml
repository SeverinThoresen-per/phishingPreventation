I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing =
a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he di=
d not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is th=
e issue.  Does that matter?

Subject:	Recovery of H-1B Visa Fees

Margaret Daffin and I had a conference call with Alice Gruber regarding reco=
very of our expenses related to obtaining H-1B visas for new employees.  Mar=
garet estimates there have been three/possibly four instances where an indiv=
idual has walked away from a position after we had committed time and money =
to process the visa application.  According to Alice, the DOL regulations ch=
anged last year.=20

The regulations do not allow an employer to penalize a foreign national for =
the employer's cost of obtaining the visa.  The regs do allow the employer t=
o recover "bonafide liquidated damages" in the amounts "stipulated by the pa=
rties at the beginning of the contract."  The "liquidated damages" may vary =
from state to state.  Since our offer letter does not put these candidates o=
n notice of our intent to recover such costs, there has been no stipulation =
by the parties.  If we put them on notice, then the most we could attempt to=
 recover would be our attorneys fees, not the filing fees. =20

However, Alice does not recommend that we attempt to recover our costs.  She=
 thinks the legal fees for trying to recover these monies would outweigh the=
 H-1B costs ($3,000.00 on average).

Also, Alice expressed concern that if we add some type of "notice" language =
to the offer letter, that we will force some candidates to accept jobs with =
other companies that don't threaten to recover these costs.  She believes th=
is could have a "chilling" effect and cause us to lose quality candidates. =20

I asked if we could put some kind of notice in the packet that Margaret Daff=
in sends out to the Candidates explaining what information she needs to proc=
ess their visa applications.  We can do that, but that may drive some candid=
ates away.

Alice thinks the unstable economy will reduce the number of candidates who w=
alk away after the visa has been processed.  s. Apparently this was a fairly=
 common practice in the last couple of years when the economy was stronger a=
nd the candidates were more cavalier about turning down positions.  =20

Let me know what you think.  Alice would like to be very involved if we deci=
de to try to collect these monies. =20
