We are working on this issue this week by meeting with Joe Dilg and putting =
forth a summary memo of the history of the situation, the pay requirements u=
nder the contract, and recommendations of how to move forward.  That will be=
 done this week, and everyone on this email will be copied on it.  Michelle

Mary & Pam -- Diomedes has sent me a number of messages this week asking abo=
ut the status of the payment(s) under the ECI Buyout Agreement.  I have been=
 putting him off now for several weeks but he is justifiably asking for an e=
xplanation as to what the issue is.  He is planning to be in Houston tomorro=
w and Friday and wanted to know who he could talk to about this, short of ca=
lling Ken Lay.  It may be most appropriate for him to simply call Ken but I'=
d like to know from you how you would you like to handle this. =20

Based on my reading of the contract, I believe it is clear that we owe him (=
i.e., ECI) payments under the ECI contract and that we do not have the right=
 to set off payments he owes us against payments we owe ECI.  The ECI contra=
ct provides interest on late payments of the greater of Chase's prime rate p=
lus 2% or 14%, which interest is currently accruing on the past due amounts.=
  I think it would be helpful if we could arrange a call with some or all of=
 the group copied on this email to discuss further how to proceed.  Thanks.

Regards,
	John
