I will take a look at the Guaranty and get back to you but my recollection=20
was that the termination provisions did not make clear that the Guaranty=20
would remain in place with respect to obligations that arose after the=20
termination date with respect to transactions that were entered into prior t=
o=20
the termination date and taht was the concept that needs to be addressed.

Susan,
Carol,

I reviewed this response from the credit person at WPS, I have looked at the=
=20
Guaranty we receive from them with respect to the paragraph he refers to, I=20
do not know if the particular sufficient satisfies your request or if your=20
requested language stills needs to be inserted.

Please advise,
Russell

Russell,

There is already language in the Guaranty that acknowledges and guarantees
payment of WPS ESI obligations and liabilities under terms of the
"Agreements".  You request only restates what has already been defined and
agreed to.  I don't understand why it needs to be stated again.
