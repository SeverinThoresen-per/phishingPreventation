Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute=20
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a=

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we=20
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and=20
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday =20

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so=20
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the=20

something afterwards. =20

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the=20
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time=
