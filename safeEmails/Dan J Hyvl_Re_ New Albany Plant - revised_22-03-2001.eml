Jim,
 I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sale=
s=20
Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on=20
your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can star=
t=20
on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the=20
Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several=20
omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will=20
not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed=
=20
out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hu=
b=20
first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's=20
discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.
