I hope you are well. Until today, I did not know there was another Kaminski=20
at Enron. Perhaps you know him already but I found him in the Enron address=20
book his first name is Jim.

I am enrolled in the above mandatory program and I have nominated you in the=
=20
peer/colleague category,  to provide feedback on me. I do not know the natur=
e=20
of the questions you would be required to respond to but sometime soon you=20
would receive an e-mail asking you for your input.=20

I know your plate is full and life is already hectic but I thought I could=20
nominate you for your input.  I should be grateful if you would take some=20
time off your very hectic schedule and provide the feedback on me.

Very many thanks,
