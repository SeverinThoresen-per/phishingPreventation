I have good news, finally!  The Cardiologist says everything with Linda's he=
art is within normal limits.  There are some criteria that are close to bein=
g out of the normal range, so he is going to run some other tests to create =
a baseline and is going to monitor her annually.  The Cardiologist concurred=
 with her primary care doctor that the anemia, along with the post-surgerica=
l complications she experienced probably caused the heart palputations.=20
