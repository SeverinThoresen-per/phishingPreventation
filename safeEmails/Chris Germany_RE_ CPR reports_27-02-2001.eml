Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us=20
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe=20
regardless of desks.  For example, if I want to see all business that is=20
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and=
=20
the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12=20
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more. =20

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll int=
o=20
one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from=20
the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to=20
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk=
=20
first when submitting a report. =20

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks!

Kathy
