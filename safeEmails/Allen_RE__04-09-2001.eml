According to Jacques, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, Kevin Kolb.  I=
 just spoke to Kevin.  The Kuo's have been away on vacation.  He is going to=
 try and get things finalized this week.  It sounds like they want to sign a=
nd exchange money in person.  This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probabl=
y be  the most convenient time.  I will let you know when I hear more from K=
evin Kolb.
