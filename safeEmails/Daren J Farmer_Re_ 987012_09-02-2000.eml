I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.  You will need to repat=
h=20
and renom this in MOPS.  Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead=20
meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter=20
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under=20
Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be=
=20
under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move=20
them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a souther=
n=20
term!!)
