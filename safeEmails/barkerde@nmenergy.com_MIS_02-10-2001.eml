While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limita=
tion
of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up.
Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster
then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in orde=
r to
avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that thin=
gs
have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, =
we
should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in M=
IS.
An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and
using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) =
and
gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted,
have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ra=
y
directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.
