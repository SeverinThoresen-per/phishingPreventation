Group,
A quick reminder.  When doing a buy/resale where we are purchasing from a=20
counterparty, please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty=20
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you.  So for a $5=20
buy/resale at 130/135 the legs would be a buy at $135, and a sell at $130. =20
In scheduling you will see a positive price of $5.  A negative price in=20
scheduling represents US getting paid.  If you have questions please ask.

Thanks,
Bill Williams
