Subject: DTI (CNG) Storage Offering.

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they=
=20
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of=20
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10=20
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional=20
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio,=20
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would=20
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we=
=20
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving u=
s=20
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the=
=20
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize=
=20
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio, =20
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need i=
s=20
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he=20
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities=20
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering=20
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at=20
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on=
=20
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back i=
n=20
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy=
=20
capacity coming out in the next few weeks. =20

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacit=
y=20
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released=20
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in=20
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer o=
f=20
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant=
=20
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at=20
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacit=
y=20
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due t=
o=20
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case=20
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer=
,=20
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market=20
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity=20
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen=
=20
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the=20
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing=
=20
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release=20
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below=
=20
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as=20
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the=20
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going=20
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with=20
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year=20
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even=20
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In=20
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped=
=20
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I=20
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be=20
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from=20
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso=
=20
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have=20
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis=20
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this=20
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be=
=20
also get stronger.
