What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special to=
 the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't know =
enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell you h=
ow wonderful it is for $60? =20

Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - may=
be only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a=
 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the co=
ordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, =
anyway. =20

You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean fo=
r these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full f=
orce for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally=20

Got ones with white orchids--but the lily of the valley would be an
additional $60--what do you think?  Got a white rose for dad.
