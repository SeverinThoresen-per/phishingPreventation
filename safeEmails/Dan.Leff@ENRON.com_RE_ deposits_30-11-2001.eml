My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of =
~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit =
was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our c=
lients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing =
and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow accoun=
t.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be net=
ted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% cur=
rent.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action=
 today.

Thanks - Dan

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking=
 about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a siz=
able deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can=
 we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we ha=
ve them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likel=
y (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

Wade
