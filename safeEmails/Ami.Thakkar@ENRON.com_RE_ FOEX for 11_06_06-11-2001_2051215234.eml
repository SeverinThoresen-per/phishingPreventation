Hello,
 << File: Foex Prices.xls >>=20
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last wee=
k.=20

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP wa=
s US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with t=
he pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have=
 been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US=
$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still p=
rice increases are expected to continue in November.=20

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.  =20


Thanks,
Monika Causholli
