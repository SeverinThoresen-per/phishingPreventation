DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new=20
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters=20
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months,=20
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let=
=20
me know, and I will generate. =20

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It=20
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with=20
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to=20
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the=20
volume one extends the full volume.


      =20

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal=20
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller
