Vince,
=20
I learned late last week that if this deal goes through, I will be joining N=
ETCO.  Unfortunately, my responsibilities, as you can imagine, are going to =
change, and I will no longer be supporting your group. Kymberly Booth will b=
e your new HR representative, and will be setting up a meeting with you shor=
tly.  I would have liked to have been able to take the time to introduce you=
 to Kym, but with my ski trip, I don't think that is going to be able to hap=
pen.
=20
Please know though that I will always be of service to you and your great te=
am, and if there is anything that I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to =
let me know.
=20
Outstanding Issue:
    Rakesh:  I am going to try and get in touch with Robert Jones today so t=
hat we can get this wrapped up.

Thanks again for all of your kindness and support,
Anne
