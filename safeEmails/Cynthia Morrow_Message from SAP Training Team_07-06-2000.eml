Answers to Commonly Asked Questions:

Complete an evaluation for the class prior to leaving the classroom
 All CPE credits will be  granted at the conclusion of all SAP classes=20

What is the attendance policy for training?
 In an effort to be supportive, we are trying to be accommodating this week=20

received after the beginning of the class will be considered no-shows.
Users that are not enrolled in classes but choose to show-up may attend on a=

user shows-up within the allotted 20 minute window, the stand-by user will=20
not be allowed to participate in the class.
