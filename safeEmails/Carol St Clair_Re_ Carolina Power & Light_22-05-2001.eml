Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve=20
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction,=20
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the=20
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed=20
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought unde=
r=20
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under th=

Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you'r=

availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where=20
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding=20
credit issues.  How should I respond to their mark-up?  This was one of=20
