Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft.

Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee?

I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to=20
include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and=20
pulp, paper and other wood products trading.

I think this is a very good idea. I assume that Corp. will be willing to sig=
n=20
a reciprocal form of this Guaranty.

Yes, I believe coal, emissions, bandwidth and pulp & paper (?) should be=20
added to the form in the "Transactions" paragraph as bracketed language that=
=20
could be used as appropriate. Harry, I assume you will handle developing the=
=20
language and submitting to Carol.=20

Do you know if Corp. has signed off on the form yet?

Please find attached for your review and approval a new multi-commodity=20
guaranty, which has been developed by Carol St. Clair. This new form would b=
e=20
used for power, gas and liquids transactions.

I believe that it could also be used for emissions and coal transactions

Jeff has already signed off on this new format.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a=20
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main=20
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you=20
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as=20
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.
