I know you all get sick and tired of people asking you for fund-raising=20
money, so I promise this will be the only time for me.  (Hopefully it's less=
=20
intrusive for you if I ask by e-mail instead of person to person)

 My son's school is participating in the Texas Marathon, which is a=20
fundraiser held at private schools across the state, where 100% of the=20
proceeds go directly to the schools.   This year is an especially important=20
one for our school because our building needs a new roof---$50,000!   Anyway=
,=20
the kids have to solicit sponsors and they have a special Texas Marathon day=
=20
at school where they walk, together with parents, pets, brothers, sisters an=
d=20
teachers, to benefit their schools.  I would really appreciate if you could=20
donate to the cause.  With the Enron matching program, it really makes a=20
difference!  His school is very small, they keep the tuition low, and they=20
teach the old-fashioned way, including Christian values.  I really want to=20
support the school and keep it going. =20

If you can give anything, please let me know via e-mail and I'll come by and=
=20
collect the check, or you can just drop it by my desk.  The checks should be=
=20
made payable to Carden-Jackson School.  I need to finish the collections by=20
October 17 so I can get the matching forms into Enron

Thanks for your help!



 Colleen
