Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Si=
tara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will =
take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message=3D{EolTransactionId=3D2101638 TransactionSysDealId=3D"" BridgeEntit=
yName=3D"EOLBridge" Message=3D"Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status=3D"F" Br=
idgeDate=3D"20011025170945CDT"}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this mor=
ning.  Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement=
 for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) =
not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caus=
ed the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the brid=
ge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these=
 deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to resta=
rt, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic=
 when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.=20
