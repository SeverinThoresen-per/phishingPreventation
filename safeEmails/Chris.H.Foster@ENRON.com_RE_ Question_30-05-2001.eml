K:

I wanted to document what just happened on receiving a dispatch instruction =
from the ISO for Harbor Cogen (harbgn_7_units).   At 12:20 we received a dis=
patch instruction from he ISO due to the Stage 1 emergency.  The request was=
 for 1 MW from Tosco and 27 MW from Harbor. =20

As you know, we are no longer the SC for Tosco and have sent you the require=
d documentation.  Can you make sure the ISO has this in their system?

With respect to Harbor, we were running 60 MW and were inc'd 27, indicating =
a request for a total of 87 MW.  We already had an approved outage request f=
rom the ISO as indicated by the fax I sent you indicating that Harbor only h=
ad 80 MW available.  So, the ISO should only have been able to dispatch 20 M=
W. =20

We initially declined the dispatch instruction from the ISO due to the error=
s the ISO made and the confusion it caused us.  We immediately "hit the phon=
es" to clarify the facts and subsequently inc'd generation to 80 MW by 12:45=
=2E  Why did the ISO dispatch group not have our outage request indicating a=
 maximum of 80 MW?=20

We believe we have completely responded to the ISO's instruction and should =
have no penalty charges.  Please let me know the settlement implications of =
this confusion event.

Thanks

Chris
