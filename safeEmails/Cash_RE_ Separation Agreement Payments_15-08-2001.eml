Could you clarify a payment classification question for me? =20

Separation Agreement payments are being entered into SAP for future payments=
=2E  These payments are in lieu of severance payments.  When these payments =
get coded into SAP, should they legally be coded as:

	1. severance payments (since they are taking the place of severance) or=20
	2. agreement payments (since it is an actual agreement)

Call me if you have any questions.  I just want to make sure that we are cod=
ing them properly. =20

Thank you.
Cindy Simon
