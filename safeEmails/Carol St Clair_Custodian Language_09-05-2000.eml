Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go=
=20
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:

collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our=20
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian hold=
s=20
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on=20
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a=20
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let=
=20
me know what you think.
