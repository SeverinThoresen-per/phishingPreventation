Michelle -

Kim and I will be speaking with Jubran at 4:00 pm today.  If it is OK, I wou=
ld like to offer COBRA costs of $7500 gross (current expenses for benefits a=
re about $700).  Is this OK?

Also, with regards to section 5.3 of this agreement, can we add a clause tha=
t says he will be compensated for his time if needed to assist with litigati=
on issues.....not sure if we have done this in the past, however, he has rai=
sed this as a concern.

Thanks!
Amy
