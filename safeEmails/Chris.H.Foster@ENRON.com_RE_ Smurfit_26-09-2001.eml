We haven't lost the Smurfit deal yet, but the client believes it is taking u=
s too long to clarify our credit parameters for this deal. =20

The individuals in Bill Bradford's group are extremely qualified and hard wo=
rking.  There are just not enough of them.  We greatly appreciate your consi=
dering if additional resources are needed.
