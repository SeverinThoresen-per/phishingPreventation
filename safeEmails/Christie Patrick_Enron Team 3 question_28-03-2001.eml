Hi Melinda!

forwarding would be great!  Thanks!

Hi Christie and Vince,

We really look forward to seeing you all next week.  We've learned a lot=20
working on this project, and think we will provide some useful information=20
for you.

If possible, we need to know what states NewPower is operating in. =20
Specifically, what states there is a current marketing campaign?  Should I=20
ask Melinda McCarty for this information?

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,

Tiger Team 3
