Hey y'all,

 the paces every a.m.  In addition, please review the previous Manitoba Busi=
ness Procedures. =20
Thanks,

An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba (MHEB) has been signed a=
nd begins tomorrow, November 1st.  In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we n=
eed to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB ma=
y frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savings w=
ith MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices/MIDW=
EST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc. I re=
alize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much busines=
s with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are working o=
n other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this deal will a=
ffect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate informatio=
n with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, please maintain=
 the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/MHEB P=
rice Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hourly and next d=
ay, record any relevant market information (see the log for examples). Inclu=
de responsibility for handling MHEB in the daily transition to the night shi=
ft.  Dean will coordinate these efforts. Please call me (cell - 713-962-0526=
) with any questions.  Thank you!=20
