Michelle,
The project is progressing. Helen has done a great job,  finding various fla=

in the initial design (Ken's design) of the Access table, and has been going=

back
and forth with Ken to modify the table. Since Helen can't devote full time t=
o=20
this project,
Chris has hired a contractor, Cecil Stradford, to do the coding. I have=20
spoken with
Cecil just now and he says no coding has been done yet. I am trying to=20
arrange=20
a meeting today with Cecil, Helen, Christin (the one who's overseeing coding=
=20
process in Cecil's company) and myself.  Will report back to you on what
is discussed in the meeting.=20

Best,
Alex
