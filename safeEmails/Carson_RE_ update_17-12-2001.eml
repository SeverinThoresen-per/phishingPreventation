Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now)=
=2E  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with t=
his entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what=
 happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  G=
ood companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.=
  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Ha=
rris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing,=
 which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

Mike,

I haven't heard from you in a while and I was wondering how the bankruptcy
has affected you.  Please send me a note or call me at work(816) 218-1606
or at home (913) 642-9758.  Hope you're doing well!

Devin
