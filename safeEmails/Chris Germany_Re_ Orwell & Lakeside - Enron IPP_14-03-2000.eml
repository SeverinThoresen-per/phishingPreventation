Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been=20
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS=20
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these=
=20
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn=20
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get=20
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just=
=20
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.
