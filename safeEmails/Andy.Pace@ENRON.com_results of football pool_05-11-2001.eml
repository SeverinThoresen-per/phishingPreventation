Hello Everyone,=20

	This weekend saw more tough games to pick, both in college and the pros. Am=
ong the games missed by many people were, in college games, Michigan/Michiga=
n St.; Stanford/Washington; UCLA/Washington St.; Illinois/Purdue; and Texas =
A&M/TexasTech.=20
In the pros, Baltimore/Pittsburgh was not a good game for most people, Seatt=
le/Washington was a bad one and NY/Jets/New Orleans was missed by most peopl=
e, while Kansas City/San Diego was not correctly picked by anyone.=20

	We had 31 entries this week, making the pot $93. Currently in the lead is R=
obert Vargas, with only 6 games missed. No one else had 6 wrong, while Carte=
r Ellis was the only one with 7 wrong. Robert picked Denver tonight, while C=
arter picked Oakland. Therefore, if Denver wins, Robert will win outright; i=
f Oakland wins, then it will come down to the total points scored. Robert ch=
ose 49, while Carter choose 30. Therefore, if Oakland wins and there is 40 o=
r more points, then Robert will win, 39 or less with Oakland, then Carter wi=
ll win. Here are the number of games each person missed this week.=20
