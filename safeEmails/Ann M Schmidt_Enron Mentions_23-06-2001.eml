HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A Houston-based federal grand jury indicted Steven Gar=
y=20
Todoroff, former trader for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) EOTT Energy Corp. (EOT), lat=
e=20
Wednesday on charges he funneled 100,000 barrels of butane gas meant for EOT=
T=20
into a company of his own for later sale to a third party at just under $1=20
million.=20
EOTT terminated Todoroff for the alleged malfeasance in 1999.
"There was apparently concealment of other natural gas trading activity,"=20
said EOTT spokeswoman Gina Taylor.=20
According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Cedric Joubert, Todoroff is accused of=20
bartering a deal in which Petrogas Inc. would have supplied EOTT with butane=
=20
for a repayment of butane a year later. Todoroff then allegedly steered the=20
Petrogas butane to Monarch Media Resources Corp., which he owned, and sold=20
the gas to the Oklahoma office of Gas Producers Liquids Inc. for $996,187.50=
=2E=20
EOTT took a $3 million charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 1999 to=20
cover the cost of purchasing additional butane to deliver to Petrogas, Taylo=
r=20
said.=20
Todoroff's attorney, Wendell A. Odom, Jr., doesn't deny his client made the=20
trade, but said it was a side trade that had nothing to do with EOTT=20
operations, and therefore shouldn't be a criminal offense.=20
"From the onset of this, we've always contended that this is a civil debt,"=20
Odom said. "This was a personal investment."=20
Odom said Todoroff was following a generally accepted practice of side=20
trading on the deal, and EOTT got involved by the confusion of other players=
=20
in the trade.=20
"Everybody just assumed it was an EOTT deal, even though it wasn't," he said=
=2E=20
"EOTT made the decision to belly up to the bar and pay off when it came time=
=20
to deliver."=20
Joubert said Todoroff will more than likely appear before a judge late next=20
week for an arraignment on the charges. The judge will then schedule a trial=
=20
date, to begin within 70 days of the arraignment.=20
The nature of the deal, which took 13 months, kept EOTT from discovering the=
=20
action until late in the process.=20
"The way he allegedly set up the contracts, we didn't know about it until it=
=20
was time to pay Petrogas," Taylor said. "When Petrogas calls us and said the=
y=20
needed payment, that's when we started looking at the transaction."=20
Petrogas, which Joubert said is a Canadian company with an operating arm in=20
Texas, couldn't be contacted Friday.=20
Joubert said Natural Gas Liquids isn't suspected of any wrongdoing in the=20
case, though he noted Todoroff used to live in Oklahoma.=20
"I assume he still knew some people there," Joubert said.=20
Natural Gas Liquids owner Greg Stiman, based in Houston, wasn't in the offic=

Friday and unavailable for comment. News Article On EOTT Charge Aroused=20
Suspicions=20

EOTT took total charges of $9.8 million, or 35 cents a diluted unit in the=20
fourth quarter of 1999, explaining in a press release that the amount covere=
d=20
"the cost to exit mid-continent natural gas liquids activities that are no=20
longer needed as a supply function for crude oil blending activities on the=20
West Coast; severance costs for work force reduction due to operating=20
efficiencies from recent acquisitions; implementation of a new marketing and=
=20
accounting system; and a theft of NGL product, concealment of NGL commercial=
=20
activities and other unauthorized NGL actions by a former employee."=20
The company reported losses that quarter of $7.48 million, or 27 cents a uni=
t=20
after the charge. By contrast, EOTT reported earnings for 2000's fourth=20
quarter of $3.71 million, or 13 cents a unit.=20
According to Joubert, EOTT had to buy butane from Amoco Inc. - now BP Amoco=20
PLC (BP) - to replace the butane owed Petrogas.=20
"The real loss has to do with the replacement costs with the gas - a year=20
after (Todoroff) got his money," Joubert said.=20
Odom maintains that Todoroff was making a legal trade through Monarch Media,=
=20
but simply didn't have the funds to cover the cost of replacing the butane=20
when it came due.=20
"(Todoroff) did not have the financial resources, he just got caught short o=

MADRAS, India, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. firm CMS Energy Corp's LNG-based=20

Rodney E. Boulanger, CMS Generation Co's president, said in a statement=20
e-mailed to Reuters that the firm though "not threatening to withdraw" from=20

"The Ennore project is essentially stalled until the government can design=20
