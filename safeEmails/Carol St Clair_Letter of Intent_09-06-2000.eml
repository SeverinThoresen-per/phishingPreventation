Jason:
I thought that your drfat letter of intent looked fine.  Just a few=20
commments.  In section 6 - Conditions, could you put something in there=20
similar to the "Approvals" section in the November 10th letter since possibl=
y=20
HSR and FERC approval may be needed?  Alos, in Attachment A, in Section 3=20
could you sya something to the effect that if tthere is no master in place=20
with Enron and a particular counterparty then Enron needs to be satisfied=20
with the terms of the master that is in place between Mrechant and such=20
counterparty.

I thought that the Assignment Agreement was very weak and that we need=20
something more than that.  Withg respect to the consent, the concept of the=20
assigned transaction be goverened by our Master needs to be in there.  =20
Enclosed is the template that we have used in the Columbia deal. =20

Call me if you have any questions.  The only time that I won't be reachable=20
today is from 11:30-2.
