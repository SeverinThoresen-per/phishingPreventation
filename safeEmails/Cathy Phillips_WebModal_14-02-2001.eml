At Monday's EGM meeting, Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal=20
acquisition EGM made last week.  Following is a brief description of the=20
freight capacity market and what WebModal gets us:

Market

The US market for logistics is $600bn annually.  We are pursuing the largest=
=20
homogenous segment which is long-haul truckload and intermodal.  That market=
=20
is $50-$100bn annually, depending on who you ask and whether you include=20
dedicated fleets.

The interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely=20
fragmented and massively intermediated.  There are over 100,000 trucking=20
companies (carriers) in the US and thousands of independent brokers (brokers=
=20
in this market act as credit principals).  10-20% of all loads are conducted=
=20
in the spot market (brokered) and the rest are done under 1-3 year contracts=
=20
that are generally non-firm, but define the relationship between each shippe=
r=20
and their chosen carriers or intermediaries.

On the rail side, the US railroads act as wholesalers, selling their capacit=
y=20
to Intermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs).  The IMCs then retail or broker ou=
t=20
that capacity to shippers.  The difficult part of ground intermodal is that=20
the rail haul makes up only the long-haul component.   The trip from the=20
origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the=20
destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck. =
=20
This first and last mile transportation is called "drayage". =20

WebModal

WebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they=20
look identical to truck.  They have a database with prices and schedules fro=
m=20
all the RRs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete US coverage.  =
A=20
buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive=20
instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service.

Because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail=20
and truck, the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation i=
s=20
significant.  For any move greater than 500 miles, intermodal is generally=20
20-30% less expensive than a single driver truck move.  The substitutability=
=20
of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price.

The WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise=20
and a good head start as we enter this market.  The next move will be to=20
build a truck intermediation capability. =20

I encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal.  He will be=20
spending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dan Reck
