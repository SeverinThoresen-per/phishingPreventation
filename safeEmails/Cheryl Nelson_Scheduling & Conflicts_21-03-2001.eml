Sara,=20

Keegan has notified me this morning (!) that my calendar contains a shedulin=
g=20
conflict (again) between the swaps group meeting which is 10-11 and a meetin=
g=20
with representatives coming from GE.  I think Keegan got confused or=20
something.  Since this has happened before, I am going to sit down with=20
Keegan this afternoon to discuss how to schedule and to troubleshoot=20
scheduling issues. =20


For today, I am going to try to do this - I am going to try to end the GE=20
meeting early but I cannot promise.  As I explained to Keegan, since the GE=20
meeting is with someone traveling to Enron to attend and is critical to Enro=
n=20
Corp., I will not be able to cancel it at the last minute.

If I do not attend, please apologize to the Group to me.  I am a bit=20
frustrated because I certainly wanted to attnd to find out what everyone els=
e=20
is working on and to report on what I am doing.  I will try to email an=20
update in advance and if you do not mind, maybe you could share it with the=20
Group.

Hi Keegan,=20

Thank you for calling this morning to provide me with my schedule for today.=
 =20

I want to share some constructive advice on how to fine tune our strategy=20
with respect to scheduling because Keegan this is critical to my providing=20
the best legal counsel I can to the various clients we serve.  You indicated=
=20
that there is a conflict on the schedule in that there is a 9:30-10:30=20
meeting that conflicts with the Swaps Group meeting.  We do not want to=20
schedule conflicting meetings and then realize it at the last minute and the=
n=20
just notify one group that we can't attend. =20

What you want to do is this:  You want to try at the time of the invitation=20
to attend or as soon as practicable to notify me that there would be a=20
potential conflict.  Then I will try to rescheduel.  This is especially=20
important because the meetings with GSS are usually with folks from outside=20
Enron, so once we agree to attend, it is nearly impossible the morning befor=
e=20
to try to reschedule.  But the swaps meetings and credit meetings are very=20
important and there are a lot of issues I need to discuss and anticipated=20
attending.  Also and I have missed some in the past due to scheduling=20
conflicts. =20

Again, I also hope and need for you to take this advice constructively and=20
not personally.  I appreciate all of your efforts, Keegan. =20

Let's meet this afternoon to talk strategy.  Please note on my calendar that=
=20
Ischeduled two meetings this morning, one at 2:30 and one immediately=20
following at 3:30 until 5.  So we should meet before then. =20
