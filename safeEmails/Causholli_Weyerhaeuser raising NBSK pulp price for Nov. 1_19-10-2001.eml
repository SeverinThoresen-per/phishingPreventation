San Francisco, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase th=
e U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/ton=
ne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source. Another buye=
r source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdu=
st pulp that he buys, "and I assume on the others." Weyerhaeuser officials w=
ere not available for comment. Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the=
 U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American producers we=
nt to $500/tonne. The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price =
was a drag on their efforts. Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/=
tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the market, but als=
o because demand has been so slow. A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/t=
onne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price. "I don't thi=
nk we will pay $500 (in November)," a buyer said today. "I think it will be =
$490." An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a plus," but added=
, "Now all we need is for demand to pick up." Another agent also responded c=
autiously. "There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has pi=
cked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that, (producers) can =
announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk," he said. As for Octo=
ber transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't move. "I know everyone=
 needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have gone down, but my f=
eeling is they will go up again," he said, noting typical late-fall patterns=
=2E  said that in contrast to the past, paper companies have not been able t=
o make money off of low prices. "It's going to be a battle, for sure," he sa=
id. "There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buyers) are saying they'r=
e not going to pay it."=20
