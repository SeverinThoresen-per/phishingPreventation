I recommend this wording...

ETS is in the process of evaluating the feedback and system requests from th=
e NNG Winter Operations meeting.  A system enhancement to notify shippers wh=
en they have nominated to an alternate receipt or delivery point that is not=
 on their contract is on the list for consideration.  The requirements for t=
his modification are currently being determined, however, the exact method a=
nd wording of the message has not been finalized.  It is anticipated that th=
e enhancement will be installed in the first quarter of 2002. =20
