I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet. =
=20
The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How=20
should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the=20
capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?
