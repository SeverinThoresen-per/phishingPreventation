Brent called this morning and has corrected me on this issue. The scenario=20
provided by the FX Desk that I discussed in my previous e-mail is where Enro=
n=20
in the UK offers products to external counterparties. The present online FX=20
scenario is not the case; we are offering the Product internally, so the=20
Enron trading entity would be Risk Management and Trading Corp. "RMT" (as=20
seen in the Product Long Description sent earlier).

So, in your consideration today, please amend my previous explanation by=20
replacing reference to ENA with RMT, and consider any service agreement or=20
tax issues that may occur as a result of this amendment.

My apologies for any confusion this may have caused.

Dale
