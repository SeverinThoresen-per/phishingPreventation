Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that=
 briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this dep=
artment  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be i=
nterested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand h=
ow Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an in=
terest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference =
room to be available.
Thanks-
Gary
