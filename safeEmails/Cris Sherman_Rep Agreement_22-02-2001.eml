Sara, in the interest of time this morning, I thought  I would send a quick=20
e-mail. I have read the appendix to the repo agreement and think it is OK. =20
No accounting issues, I think they just want to address the substitution=20
mechanics.  Technically, repo transactions are FAS 125 transactions (sales o=
f=20
financial assets), so I presume that is why the "FAS 125" is noted at the to=
p=20
of the page (I don't believe it is necessary - what value does it add?).  I=20
think the issue is one for Treasury  - are we OK with the counterparties=20
ability to terminate the contract if we do not agree to the replacement=20
(substituted) securities? Hope this helps.
