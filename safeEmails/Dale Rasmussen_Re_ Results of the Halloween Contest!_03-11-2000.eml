Touche'

Clearly those in power are interested in one thing--preserving their=20
privileged position and the status quo.  My opponent is for big lycra.  I=20
don't trust big lycra.  I trust the people, and their own ears.

I will make a pledge right now that if I am selected to win next year in=20
advance, I will NOT wear camouflage lycra on Halloween.  (This pledge alone=20
should ensure my victory).

Furthermore, since my worthy opponent nearly had to pass out earplugs as a=20
form of defense against the colorful nature of his costume, I think he shoul=
d=20
be the last to make allegations regarding "visual impairment."  Is that what=
=20
"visions and values" is all about?

I for one believed the judging to be objective and fair. Clearly, "price=20
caps" are out of favor. Enron's totally impartial judges, and FERC's=20
independent analysis, reached  the same (appropriate) conclusion.  As for=20
fatigues, they are difficult to see, so how can one expect to be evaluated=20
on  a costume that is visually disadvantaged.=20

The foundation of  Enron's business is competition. Obviously, the=20
exceptional wisdom of the independent judges recognized that cycling is a=20
highly competitive activity. Therefor, a cycling costume reflected the spiri=
t=20
of Enron and the Halloween competition.=20

 My suggestion to Mr. Rasmussen for next years competition is that he wear=20
lycra camouflage.
