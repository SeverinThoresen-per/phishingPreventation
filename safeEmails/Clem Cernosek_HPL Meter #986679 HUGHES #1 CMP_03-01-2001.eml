Daren:

During the months of October 1999 and November 1999, gas flowed into HPL's=20
pipeline at the above meter.    This gas was previously transported by EOG=20
Resources  to Mobil (Beaumont) with the excess being purchased.   The Deal=20
that EOG Resources Transport Contract (012-36702-02-001) moved gas to Mobil=20
Beaumont expired a the end of September, 1999, but gas continued to flow int=
o=20
HPL's pipeline.  Currently, these volumes are being recorded to the HPL=20
Strangers Gas Contract.   Logistics needs a deal to purchase these volumes.
