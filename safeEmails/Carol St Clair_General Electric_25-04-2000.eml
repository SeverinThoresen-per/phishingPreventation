Suzanne:
Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office=20
today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your=20
message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report=20
before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning=20
when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think abou=
t=20
what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will=20
know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He'=
s=20
almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless t=
o=20
say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny=20
thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could=20
not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was ther=
e=20
so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was=20
saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a=20
good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me=20
right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again=
,=20
you had to be there!

Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take=
=20
it one day at a time.

Carol
