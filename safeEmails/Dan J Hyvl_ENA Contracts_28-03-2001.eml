Dan,

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA? =20

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas=20
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle=20
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We=20
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with=20
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place=20
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts i=
n=20
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?
