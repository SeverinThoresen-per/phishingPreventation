In general, I would like all my clients to be notified that the wire transfe=

Please send an e-mail to Tom Barringer with a copy to Scott Hawley and me.

The Harbor Cogen payment was scheduled for tomorrow, 5/8/01, due to needed v=
erifications of information and tight SAP deadlines.  I am actually the corr=
ect person to contact regarding ISO actualization bookings while in the proc=
ess of training Sharon Fredrick, who will be assuming these responsibilities=
 until Audrey returns.  This is probably why Godfrey was unaware of the stat=
us.  Please let me know why the client was given a payment date of today and=
 in the future, if a specific date of payment is needed, please specify on t=
he email when payment is requested.  This will ensure we are meeting your de=
adlines and communicating openly.

I apologize for any disruption of service during this transition and trainin=
g period.  In the future, we will ensure that you are notified in advance vi=
a email of any expected payment dates so communication is clear.

If you have any other concerns or questions, please let me know.

Thanks, Melissa  713-853-5615

Can you please give me an update on the Harbor Cogen payment?  We told the c=
lient they were going to be paid today.  I phoned Godfrey who couldn't tell =
me the status.  I will need to inform the client what is going on first thin=
g in the morning.

Let me know if there is anything I can be doing to avoid situations like thi=
s in the future.=20

Thanks
