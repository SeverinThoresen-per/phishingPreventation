Sounds interesting (although I don't have capital dollars at this point for =
modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).   Let me touch base with=
 my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you.

On a similar note: in trying to come up with a settlement in the negotiated =
rates proceeding, we have discussed the possibility of allowing shippers to =
directly input a receipt and delivery point perhaps with a certain time peri=
od in mind to determine if capacity is available.   What I'm thinking of is =
like letting them have access to our CAS system with us giving the final ok =
as to capacity availability.  This would help IS who argue that our reports =
are not user friendly.  Legitimately, this type of instant information is al=
l they should really need (as opposed to us having to post every deal we do-=
-why should they be able to steal it at the last minute by slightly outbiddi=
ng the deal or forcing a tie in a maximum rate situation when they really di=
dn't initiate a specific request for capacity.   It seems like this is somet=
hing we would want to do, but there a lot of outstanding issues--is it feasi=
ble from a systems standpoint, is it economical, etc?   Is TW more doable th=
an NNG since it has fewer points?  Greg asked me to get with you to see if t=
his issue can be further explored.  I do believe Steve Harris and the commer=
cial group are interested.  Pls. let me know what you think.   Thanks,  Mari=

Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operati=
onally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB st=
andards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said =
that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L=
 and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardi=
zed data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB=
 version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and=
 I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopte=
d by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.

I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  =
Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the st=
andardization.

Indicated Shippers in their Reply to our Reply brief (at 19) argue that we i=
mplied that our capacity postings are consistent with the standardized Gisb =
format.  They compare our postings to NGPL's, which are different, to suppor=
t their argument.  Then they conclude that there is no standardized GISB cap=
acity-posting format.  Is this true?  How can we respond if this comes up at=
 oral argument tomorrow?  Maria
