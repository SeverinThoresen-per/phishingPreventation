Sheila, good to hear from you.  The meeting went very well. although I was v=
ery nervous about this one.
Good response from the customers.  We had approximately 80 customers at the =
meeting.  I think
that is a record.  Call me when you feel like it and I tell you more.  Hope =
you are feeling well.  Thanks. Lynn

All,

The presentations have been posted to NNG's "Download" Site at <http://www.n=
ng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These prese=
ntations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion w=
ould be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easie=
st way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. "Save target as"
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on "save"

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to th=
eir PC.

Thx,

Toby
