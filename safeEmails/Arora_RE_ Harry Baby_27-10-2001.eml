Hi Darren

You sure did. =20
=20
The whole thing going around here just convinces me how the basic economics =
and business ideas work as they should.  They all loved us for nearly four y=
ears - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us.=
 The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend t=
ime looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the ne=
xt Enron.
=20
As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it throu=
gh, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual =
captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - w=
hy would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here i=
s availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  O=
nce the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay.=20
=20
In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest c=
ommodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.
