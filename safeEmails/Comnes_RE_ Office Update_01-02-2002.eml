Just so there's no confusion: I, too, have accepted a position with UBS Warb=
urg to be a part of its regulatory affairs team.

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what h=
as been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what i=
s likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizin=
g for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the las=
t couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people h=
ave wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who w=
ill be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who=
 do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, =
(3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, a=
nd (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition=
 to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepte=
d positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name	First Name	Last Name	First Name=09
Amador	Susan	Oh	John=09
Anderson	John	Platter	M=09
Bulbes	Victor	Postlethwaite	John=09
Chang	Fang-Tzu	Richter	Jeffrey=09
Chatterton	Jill	Robinson	Donald=09
Crandall	Sean	Salisbury	Holden=09
Cutsforth	Diane	Scholtes	Diana=09
Dasovich	Jeff	Semperger	Cara=09
Davidson	Debra	Sheidun	Donna=09
Dean	Craig	Shields	Jeffrey=09
Dunton	Heather	Slinger	Ryan=09
Etringer	Michael	Solberg	Geir=09
Gilbert	Michael "Scotty"	Steiner	David=09
Gustafson	Mollie	Stokley	Marlin "Chris"=09
Hall	Stephen	Swain	Stephen=09
Heizenrader	Timothy	Swerzbin	Michael=09
Kandaswamy	Balachandar	Thomas	Jacob=09
Lackey	Christopher	Thome	Stephen=09
Lee	Eugene	Van Houten	Maria=09
Mallory	Patrick "Chris"	Villeggiante	Theresa=09
McDonald	Michael	Wente	Laura=09
Meyer	James	Williams	William J=09
Meyers	Albert	Woodland	Andrea=09
Mier	Michael	Yoder	Christian=09
Nelson	Kourtney		=09

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest o=
f the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not =
entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks=
 like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary i=
nitiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The=
 first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well =
under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort toget=
her with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing =
since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity p=
ositions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People w=
orking on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Ba=
ughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice =
on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, =
Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of the=
se people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that=
 they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procu=
rement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron h=
as already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be locate=
d on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope t=
o make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the=
 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurd=
le.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on o=
r about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation =
over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron=
 story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are find=
ing out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been=
 easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesom=
e team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining w=
ith Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team t=
he best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work wit=
h each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim
