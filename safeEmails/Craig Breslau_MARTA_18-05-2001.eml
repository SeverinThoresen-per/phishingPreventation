They are fully authorized to hedge.  Thay already sent a copy of the Board=20
Resolution to Jay Williams.  Their Investment Policy also allows them to=20
hedge.

MARTA has been hedging interest rates and fuel since the early 80's.  As a=20
matter of fact their hedging program is featured in "Corporate Investing"=20
magazine.  I have faxed a copy of this article for your attention.

Should you need to reach her, Thay Bishop's number is 404-848-5485.

Since we are one of their new counterparties in their long-running hedging=20

possible.  Your assistance in getting this confirm to them as soon as=20
possible is greatly appreciated.
