NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space caus=
ing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the I=
D1 cycle. The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , Toby =
responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not get a=
 response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for over =
two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so we coul=
d relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem would be =
resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , we were t=
old that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecting print =
servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washington could =
not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the Solution Cent=
er, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we went through t=
he Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen responded to the ea=
rlier page, We had several technical problems to work through this morning, =
but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support people.

New Years Morning Crew,
Kathy Washington
