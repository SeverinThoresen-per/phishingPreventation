	Dial=20
	Master Packaging  (Master Packaging (N.B.) Inc.
	Sodra (Sodra Skogsagarna)
	Appleton Paper

Further, the following master agreements were negotiated out of London with =
the Enron affiliate -- Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. ("ECTRIC"):

		Caima (Companhia de Celulose do Caima)


Let me know if you have any questions with the foregoing.
