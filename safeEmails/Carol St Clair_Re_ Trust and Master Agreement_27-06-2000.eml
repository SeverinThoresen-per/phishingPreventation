Janet:
Thanks.  After reviewing these agreements, we would like to see the=20
Acquisition Agreement whereby the Partnership acquires its interest in the=20
Trust.  Alos, we would like to confirm with Henry that after giving effect t=
o=20
all of the transactions that are described in the Master Agreement that the=20
Partnership's only asset will be its interest in the Trust and the=20
distributions that are made with respect to such interest.  Is that correct?=
 =20
Does the Partnership have any other source of csah flow?
