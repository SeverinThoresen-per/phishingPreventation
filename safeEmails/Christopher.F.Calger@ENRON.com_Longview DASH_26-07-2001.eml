Louise,

A DASH should hit your desk tomorrow.  We are requesting an additional $9MM =
to increase our exposure to $25MM.  This will cover us through 10/31 which s=
hould give us enough time to close the sale.  The exposure is as follows:

GE Gas Turbine:	$10.2MM
Alstom Steam		$7.0MM
Nooter/Eriksen HRSG:	$2.5MM
Engineering:		$2.2MM
Gas Interconnect:	$0.9MM
Soft Costs/IDC:		$2.7MM	=09

The development in general has gone very well.  We believe that the remainin=
g development risk is low and manageable.  The info memorandum has lots of d=
etails.  The preliminary, non-binding, indicative notional bids are as follo=
ws:

NRG:		$25-$30MM
McCook:	$20MM
Calpine:		$18MM
PPL Global:	$15MM
AES:		$11MM
El Paso:	$10MM
Sempra:	$3MM

Williams and Allegheny showed us tolling bids.  Williams was below our desk =
mid ($5.50/kwmonth); Allegheny was not economic for our asset, but above our=
 desk mid ($8.25/kwmonth).  We are countering to both with desk offers.

Nothing yet out of Duke or Dynegy, but they say they are working on it.  Eve=
rybody else is out (Mirant, Constellation, Entergy, FPL, PG&E, Orion, PSEG, =
Tractabel).

I am obviously available at your convenience to discuss.

Regards,

Chris Calger
