Good.  Assuming you received my phone mail with the Earp's address etc.,
can you forward me two originals of the offer so that I can send them on to
the Earps?  Again, their street address is 26 Lily Lane in Crane, TX
79731.  The agreed to price is $45/acre at 640 acres, or $28,800.  I.C.
Earp et ux Irma.
I'll call him and alert him when the paperwork is ready to send, hopefully
tomorrow.

Thanks


Candy

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the
deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property,
no bill of sale is needed.

p.s.  we are not selling a pipeline at all.  just the fee property on which
no pipelines exist.  tell me where I lost you and I'll be happy to clarify
further.

Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I
was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.

Candy
