James responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the auto=
mated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the exist=
ing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  James says that th=
is sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources =
to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly. =20

Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and h=
as lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails fr=
om him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his=
 confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always c=
ontacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain hi=
s confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with i=
ssues instead of always contacting me first.  (Don't worry - you are not alo=
ne in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we =
can manage this better. =20

This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and =
RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working o=
n this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if=
 is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large=
 number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automat=
ed solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks.=

This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
