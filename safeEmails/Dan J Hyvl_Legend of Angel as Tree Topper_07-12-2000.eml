Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting=20
?ready for his annual trip...but there were=20
?problems everywhere.=20

?Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves=20
?did not produce the toys as fast as the regular=20
?ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure=20
?of being behind schedule.=20

?Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming=20
?to visit. This stressed Santa even more.=20

?When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that=20
?three of them were about to give birth and two had=20
?jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.=20
?More Stress.=20

?Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the=20
?boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground=20
?and scattered the toys.=20

?Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for=20
?a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went=20
?to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the=20
?liquor and there was nothing to drink.=20

?In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot=20
?and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all=20
over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom=20
?and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made=20
?from.=20

?Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed=20
?on his way to the door. He opened the door and=20
?there was a little angel with a great big=20
?Christmas tree. The angel said: "Where would you=20
?like to put this tree fat man?"=20

And that my friend, is how the little angel came=20
?to be on top of the Christmas tree=20
