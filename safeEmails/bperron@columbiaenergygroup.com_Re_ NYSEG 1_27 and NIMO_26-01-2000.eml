Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 2=
14
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mk=
t
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!
