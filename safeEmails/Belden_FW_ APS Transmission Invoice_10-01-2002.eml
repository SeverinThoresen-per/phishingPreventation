Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Ser=
vice provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in t=
he Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  Th=
ey will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs t=
o go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our D=
ecember invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate p=
ayment.

Steve
