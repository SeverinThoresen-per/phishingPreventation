Jarrod:
This looked fine to me.  My only comment is that in the definition of=20
Floating Price Payer payment Amount instead of the words "a sum" consider=20
using the words "an amount".

I have attached a draft for a Prepaid Swap. This deal needs to be structured=

in such a way that the Fixed price is payed once, and the floating price is=20
then paid every month. Please let me know if I can use the attached Draft. =20


If you have any questions please give me a call (ext. 35700).
