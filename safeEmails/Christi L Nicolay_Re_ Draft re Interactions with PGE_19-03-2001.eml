Subject: Draft re Interactions with PGE

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory=20
and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as=20
follows:

Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings,=20
it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there=
=20
are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized=
=20
drafts in advance of filing.
RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not=20
involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.
On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard=20
Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.
