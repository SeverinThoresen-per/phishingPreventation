I am sure you'all have all the CLE you probably need, but just in case you d=
o=20
not, there is an easy way to catch up!  You can earn CLE credits through=20
several websites on the internet!  The advantage of this is that all you nee=
d=20
is a computer with an internet connection.  You can "attend" when you want,=20
24 hours a day, from your home or the office!   Some will allow you to log=20
your time which enables you to break away from the "seminar" to finish at a=20
later time.   There is a fee in most cases.  You can register on-line or by=20
phone, and can charge it to your credit card with either registration=20
method. =20

The websites I know about are listed below.  There are probably more if you=20
do an internet search for "CLE".
