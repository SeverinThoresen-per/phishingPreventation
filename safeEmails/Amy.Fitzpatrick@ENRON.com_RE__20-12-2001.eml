The distribution has been created - DL-NETCO.  However, is it possible for m=
e to ask Tammie to enter all the names?  The HR generalists are meeting with=
 all of the department heads to make sure that we communicate to their emplo=
yees that they have been identified for NETCO so we are a bit short of resou=
rces this morning.

Thanks -=20
Amy
