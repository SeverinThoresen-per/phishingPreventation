They are selling gas from Montebello. =20

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from=
 the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (prin=
cipally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to ac=
tually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct.=
 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  Howeve=
r, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to =
require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at boo=
k value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff
