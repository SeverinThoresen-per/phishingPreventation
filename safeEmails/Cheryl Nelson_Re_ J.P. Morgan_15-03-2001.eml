Right, neither the file nor Aneela's list indicated that we wanted such an=20
account; we only determined that we'd need such an account when I=20
doublechecked with Aneela yesterday.  Can you enter in lotus notes or catch=20
me while you are doing it so I can see how it is done?

existing brokerage accounts, ECT Investments has an account with J.P. Morgan=
