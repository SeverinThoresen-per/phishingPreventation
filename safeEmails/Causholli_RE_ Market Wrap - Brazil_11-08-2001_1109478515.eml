As we're still in the process of refining our Brazil data, we hope to eventu=
ally start publishing some proprietary information on operating rates, FOB c=
ash costs, and prices obtained by individual companies in various geographic=
 regions.  Assuming, that is, our in-house resource is able to obtain this t=
ype of information. =20

We hope that this newsletter will provide information for discussion purpose=
s, and anyone requiring anything further can please feel free to contact tho=
se individuals from Fundamentals listed in the report.  If you don't wish to=
 receive this, then please kindly advise me and I will remove you from our d=
istribution list.  Thanks.
