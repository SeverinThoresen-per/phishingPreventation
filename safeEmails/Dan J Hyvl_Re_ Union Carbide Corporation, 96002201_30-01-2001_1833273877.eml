Linda,
 I am looking for the follow-up assignment.  I remember having it prepared=20
and signed when the AEP people were looking at the contracts across the=20
street.  The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside=
=20
in ENA through July 1999.  Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.  If I=20
don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign=20
effective as of August 1, 1999.  Is this acceptable?

Dan,

This contract was assigned to HPLC effective 5/1/00 and reassigned to ENA on=
=20
the same date.  The reassignment included a note from you dated 5/23/00=20
stating  "the Union Carbide contract has been assigned in error and is=20
reassigned to ENA because that contract was included in one of the prior ECT=
=20
monetizations".  This contract is included on the Exhibit A of the assignmen=
t=20
back to ENA.

 Is there another assignment reassigning the contract back to HPLC from ENA?

Please adivse.

Thanks,

Linda

An issue has come to light regarding this contract.  HPL has received an=20
amendment to contract 96002201 between HPL and Union wherein it refers to an=
=20
assignment between EING and HPL.   Our clerk, Cathy Harris, spoke to Dan Hyv=
l=20
concerning the Enron entity name discrepancy and obtained a copy of the=20
assignment effective 5/1/00 which includes Union Carbide as a contract to be=
=20
assigned.  The contract was evidently not assigned on the 5/1/00 date. =20
Please have someone in your group make this correction and let me know when=20
the correction is completed so that we can process the amendment timely.   =20
aa=20
