	Kent and Dave, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morn=
ing in the meeting.  High level
	recap is:


		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day
		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to
					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from
					the previous day)

		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbal=
ance
					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we
					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked
					to be pretty evenly distributed)

		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.
		_______
		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combi=
nation
					operational adjustments.

	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any qu=
estions, please let me
	know.  Thanks. Lynn=09

THanks Terry,

We still need to look into what the source of the huge daily unanticipated s=
wing numbers for the past 3 days.  Is this related to some of our scheduling=
 difficulties with BP Amoco into El Paso or is it spread across our LDC ship=
pers in the Market Area?

The storage numbers on the 8 am morning report were the correct numbers but =
the numbers being referenced to on (Sum Sheet Report) this morning had an er=
ror causing the unanticipated swing number be much larger than anticipated. =
It has been corrected and is now within 2 thousand of the 8 am report. The u=
nanticipated swing number for the two previous days still stands as shown on=
 the sum sheet report. If you have any further questions, feel free to give =
me a call at, 3-6403. Thank you.
