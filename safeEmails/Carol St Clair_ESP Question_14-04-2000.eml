Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the=20
following issue came up:

If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying=
=20
on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP=
=20
or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and=20
severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a=20
limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us=20
that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look=20
forward to hearing from you.
