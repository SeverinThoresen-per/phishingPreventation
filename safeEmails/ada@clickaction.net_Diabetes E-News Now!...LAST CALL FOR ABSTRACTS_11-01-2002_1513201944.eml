IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Care Not Linked to Learning Problems
Researchers at the University of Iowa have good news for children with type =
1 diabetes.  A recent study conducted there found that children with type 1 =
diabetes do not experience any learning problems from their diabetes treatme=
nts.  The findings, which counter earlier research linking diabetes treatmen=
t to learning troubles, appear in the January issue of the journal Pediatric=
s.

Managing Stress Could Help Control Blood Sugar
Stress has often been associated with elevated blood sugar in people with di=
abetes, but until now, there have been no large clinical studies exploring h=
ow stress management therapy might help people with the disease control thei=
r blood sugar.  New research reported by Richard Surwit, PhD., and a team fr=
om the Duke University Medical Center, found that people with type 2 diabete=
s that incorporate stress management into their daily lives can significantl=
y improve blood sugar control.  The study was published in the January, 2002=
 issue of Diabetes Care.

Mothers Who Smoke Could Create Diabetes Risk
Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden finds ano=
ther reason for people not to smoke.  The children of women who smoke during=
 pregnancy could be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesit=
y later in life, according to the new study published in this month's Britis=
h Medical Journal.=20
