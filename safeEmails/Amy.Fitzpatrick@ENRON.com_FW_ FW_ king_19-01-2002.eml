I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate D=
irector to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already D=
irector level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title=
 is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug dir=
ectly on the justification.
