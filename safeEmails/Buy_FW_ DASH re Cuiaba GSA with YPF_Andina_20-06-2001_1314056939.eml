Jim- J Block was just a gas contract. At Enron, risk is controlled through o=
ne of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily report=
ing of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken =
on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contr=
act contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doe=
sn't fit into a book. Rick

Help me understand why a DASH is being done for a gas contract?  The DASH pr=
ocess exists to approve uses of capital, not entering into a gas contract?  =
Am I missing something?
