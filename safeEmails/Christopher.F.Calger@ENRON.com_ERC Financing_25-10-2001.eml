Joe and Louise:

I was on a conf call today re ERC Financing.  Legal and Finance were on the =
call.  The consensus was that it would be difficult. =20

The structure involves selling the ERC's at market to an entity controlled b=
y the bank; buying a call from that entity; selling a put to that entity; ha=
ving a price swap (fixed/floating) with entity.  The bank would also want to=
 understand market liquidity, price transparency and the rules of every dist=
rict we have ERC's in.  The Texas SOX deal recently put into this vehicle wa=
s much simpler in a more liquid market, but it took 4 months and $1MM of leg=
al fees to put together.  The lawyers involved believe that it would be more=
 difficult and likely more expensive for the California ERC's - we have seve=
ral districts and several products. =20

$1MM+ internal resources seems like a lot for a $20MM-$30MM balance with an =
 expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the pr=
ice transparency issues (no index price).

Any thoughts?
