I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the Augus=
t invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  W=
hen we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the mee=
ting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to t=
he back office groups relatively smoothly. =20
=20
I will keep you posted.

Thanks

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks =
good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need=
 to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be alloc=
ated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Dan=
iel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to=
 get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.=
  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas =
coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I =
meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on=
 my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the=
 deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and doub=
le checking the processes will not hurt.  =20
=20
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopeful=
ly next week.
=20
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know. =20
=20
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through Jun=
e as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We d=
id have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to=
 Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
=20
=20
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  =
I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially =
since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of=
 the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more sm=
oothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on r=
esolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will ge=
t the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
=20
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ? =20
=20
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas=
 daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as ri=
sk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the thir=
d party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel=
 the world.
=20
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand=
=2E  is it just me?
=20
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and i=
n the rockies.=20
=20
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting =
their books run early.=20
=20
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we =
never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder=
=2E  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who=
 has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?=20

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not tr=
ansfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any addi=
tional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently wa=
s book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd pa=
rty deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alt=
o at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly fro=
m BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu=
/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns =
that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up. =20

Thanks=20

Anne =20
