Daren and Lauri:

We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters.  When MIPS receives a=
n=20
"incomplete" from the parent meter it sends a -0- to POPS.  Yes, this is a=20
big problem.  Our POPS team (Romeo D'Souza) has identified this problem and=20
notified MIPS.  However, he was told this was not a priority item.   In the=20
mean time we are overriding the volumes in POPS with the estimated volumes.

This particular meter was correct last night, the 14th rolled last night fro=
m=20
MIPS and overrode the BAV with a -0- from day 14 forward.

This was corrected this morning and the meter re-allocated.

Thanks,

Charlotte

Subject: PG&E Texoma Volumes

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma=20
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balanc=
e=20
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part o=
f=20
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some=
=20
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have=20
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the=20
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a=20
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a=20
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered. =
=20
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving=20
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.
