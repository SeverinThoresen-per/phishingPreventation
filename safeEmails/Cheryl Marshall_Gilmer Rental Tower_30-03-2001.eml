Yesterday, March 27 , 2001 , Aaron Ortiz visited Gilmer Tower to perform=20
required test and checks on the VHF Radio System at said tower. The equipmen=
t=20
tested good , but the following discrepancies were noted about the rental=20
tower site at Gilmer.

1. There was no FAA registration number posted on the tower.
2. Tower lights were found to be non functional, as well as either side=20
lights or the beacon on top the tower. Also observed red side light lenses=20
not covering the  fixtures, but were hanging by their safety chain. Circuit=20
breakers were checked, none appeared to be inactive and apparently the tower=
=20
light controller has failed or the bulbs are burned out.
3. There was no evidence of any equipment at the tower which would allow=20
remote monitoring of the tower lights.

In view of these discrepancies I immediately contacted Ron Green and James=20
McKay and the decision was made to remove HPL radio equipment,  license, and=
=20
log book from the location. A tower crew is scheduled to remove the coax &=20
antenna next week.=20

Recommendations are:

1. Cancel the license immediately.
2. Send a certified register letter to the tower owner stating reasons for=20
removing equipment.































7 antenna next week
