Please consider the distribution list of this email as the Enron working gro=
up for the CSFB Prepay.  I have included James Moran at CSFB and ask that Ja=
mes advise us as to the individuals within CSFB that should receive document=
s.

Mary Cook, in coordination with Sara Shackleton, hopes to distribute this ev=
ening a marked copy of the swap confirmations that address the margin issues=
 that were discussed today.

Term, rates, amount, and settlement dates will be blank but will need to add=
ress the expanded transaction.  The existing $150 will mature in one year wh=
ile the incremental $200 will mature the first week of April 2002.  The conf=
irmations will be based on the CSFB International Master ISDA agreement.  We=
 will have to determine the optimal method to address the CSFB Cayman Island=
 entity.

James Moran:

We would like to schedule a time with your internal counsel as early as poss=
ible on Tuesday to discuss the modifications.  Please advise us as to availa=
bility.

Treasa:

We have a call scheduled for 7:30 am Houston time with Houston (Paul Garcia)=
 and London (Ann Hicks) cash management to discuss the funds flow mechanics.

Could you confirm with your traders the appropriate settlement period and an=
y limitations of the existing deal.  I assume that we have to price the exis=
ting $150 and the incremental $200 on September 26 to settle on Friday Septe=
mber 28.   There can be no slippage.

Could you also distribute a draft of the prepay script?

Mary and Sara:

We will need to confirm who will be executing the documents for Enron, confi=
rms as well as corporate guaranty?

Mary Perkins:

I will need to update you as well and discuss some other aspects of the tran=
saction.
