I have created a folder in the O Drive specifically for the East Desk use.  =
The folder is called East_Desk. I have already provided access for everyone =
on the East desk.  It is a secured folder, so anyone needing access to this =
folder will have to go through UBSW Energy Information Risk Management. Plea=
se make sure that you log off and log back on to get access. =20

If you have any problems, please let me know. =20
