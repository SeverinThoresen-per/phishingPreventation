Brad,

I got a better picture of the delay issue when I talked to Keith this mornin=
g.  Apparently, his group has lost their server liscence.  As a  consequence=
 they cannot access their materials.  Keith is doing everything he can that =
does not require the server, and when they regain access, we will get the ma=
p out asap.  In the mean time, I am looking into major interconnects as well=
 as storage facilities.  As of now, I don't have a precise timeline on when =
the server issue will be resolved.  When it occurs, I'll let you know.

Thanks=20

Adam
