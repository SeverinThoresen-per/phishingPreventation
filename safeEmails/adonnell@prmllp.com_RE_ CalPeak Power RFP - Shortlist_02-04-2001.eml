I just spoke with Kim and she updated me that her credit manager is very
satisfied with the creditworthiness of United Technologies (he thoroughly
reviewed the website and all available information).  He reports UT has an
A+ rating.  However, he can find no link to CalPeak Power, and could we
please provide that.  Kim would also like some additional specifics on the
mechanisms that are envisioned for credit support from UT to CalPeak.

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.
