I do not like to recieve these emails.  PLEASE update the dispatch log=20
immediately after being dispatched.

The Enron Canada dispatch log and updating the El Paso Reconciliation sheet=20
are considered to be important performance criteria (just like inadvertancy)=
=20
with regards to customer service and settlements
