We continue to have problems accessing the EastPower Website.  The site work=
ed for the first time last Thursday, but now, it seems to be again unaccessa=
ble.  We have made several requests to Rika, but never seem to receive a res=
ponse.  Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.

thanks
brant
