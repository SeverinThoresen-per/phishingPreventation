de there is some sort of orderly liquidation of the swaps.  talk to credit a=

Hi- thought you'd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few=
 of the funds.  Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds ha=
s actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our "cr=
edit situation".  At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas=
 position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now.  They have studied o=
ur financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not =
determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit =
line situation.  Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is l=
inked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details b=
ut the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the c=
ontrary are causing some to panic.  I've heard the same come out of SAC whic=
h is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE.  SAC has just=
 started trading with us.
=20
I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group comm=
enting on our credit.  I am not having any problems YET with any of the bank=
s except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them f=
or the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to wo=
rk out a clearing system in the interim.
=20
I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. =
and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading com=
panies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And=
 at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron h=
as major franchise value.
=20
Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out =
Thursday and we rallied $4.
=20
Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sect=
or (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to =
buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they b=
elieve in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and unde=
rstand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  Th=
ey were never short us.
=20
On other names:
EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like=
 EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.
=20
Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that =
they have 0 mid-east exposure.
=20
Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen
