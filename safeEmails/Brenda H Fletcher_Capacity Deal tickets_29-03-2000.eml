Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets=20
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right=
=20
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l t=
o=20
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in=20
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes=20
sense!

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up=20
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,=20
and Tenn will be set up under both desk. =20

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. =20
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes=20
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same=
=20
contract under both desk.
