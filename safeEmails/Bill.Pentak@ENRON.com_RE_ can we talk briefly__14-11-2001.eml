Michelle,
=20
Thank you for your reply. I have been in training all day and will be there =
for half a day tomorrow.=20
=20
I did not list it on the compliance cert., because after reading the 62 page=
 code of ethics, I felt the book was outside the parameters articulated in t=
he book. After you came and talked to our class, I felt it was still outside=
 the parameters but would be best to notify you so there would be no questio=
n later. (Yes, I did read the entire code of ethics!)
=20
Hope you are doing well. Last week was a rough first week.
=20
Best Regards,=20
Bill

Bill,
=20
Thanks for your note.  I have forwarded it to our compliance officer, who us=
ually handles these types of issues. =20
=20
Did you disclose this on your certificate of compliance?  If not, that is ok=
, because you haven't written the book yet -- I was just asking.
=20
I expect to hear back from our compliance officer shortly.  She usually is q=
uite prompt.

Hello, Michelle!
=20
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book d=
eal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no prob=
lem re the confidentiality agreement.=20
=20
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years a=
nd have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their =
editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building ex=
periences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minist=
er / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
=20
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.
=20
All The Best,
Bill
