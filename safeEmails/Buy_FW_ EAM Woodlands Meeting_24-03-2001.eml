Rick,

I just realized that I failed to thank you for coming to the Woodlands last =
month to speak to the EAM and AOPS teams regarding risk management at EES.  =
In the brief time I've been at Enron, I've focused on bringing a more discip=
lined approach to, and understanding of, the importance of identifying and m=
anaging the risk inherent in the EAM business.  However, you provided a far =
more global perspective, including the view senior management, the Board, an=
d the investment community. It meant a lot to the group to have someone from=
 senior management take the time to meet with us.  =20

I'd also like to acknowledge the support we've received from Jay and others =
within RAC  - I appreciate their efforts.

Again, thanks for the visit.

Dave Roberts  =20
