I completely agree. If you don't mind, please give her a call and introduce =
yourself. I expect Sheri as part of her transition to introduce Savita to th=
e relevant folks in the operations organization. If it were not for Jennifer=
 Deny taking maternity leave I would expect her to fulfill the role Sheri ha=
d with operations, but I would like Savita to develop those relationships as=
 well.

As a point of interest, why would I ever not support Savita maintaining the =
free flow of information between the groups ? I have absolutely nothing to g=
ain and everything to lose from this not occurring.
