I'm losing track, here.  Is anyone working on an Operating Agreement with=20

Whoever has the assignment, please include language concerning not only=20
Vanek's full responsibility for operation and maintenance at no cost or=20
expense to HPL, but also his accountability to bear and fines, charges or=20
fees associated with the ownership and operation of the well.

Please send me a draft of this Operating Agreement at your earliest=20
opportunity.  Ir's effective date will be the same as the effective date for=
=20
HPL's ownership of this well.
