I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input f=
or proposed promotions for Operations.  Tana Cashion has the recommended nam=
es and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their r=
espoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know=
=2E =20

I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob=
 Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted fr=
om Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Jeff cover=
ed, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to b=
e certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  Tana was some=
how unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you rev=
iew the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure tha=
t Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion. =20

Thanks.  --Sally=20
