Kevin,

I can't remember the last time I was that relaxed!  On Sunday, Muggie asked
me in all seriousness if I had been smoking pot!

I spoke to a guy that said he spends 6-7k every 15-20k miles on ROUTINE
maintenance for his 911!  Unreal.  I have definitely scratched that one of
the list.

Looks like it is divorce court for this kid.  I can't believe it.  I am
actually disgusted by the whole affair.

How is that for an emotional swing in one email!

Have a great weekend!

Frank
