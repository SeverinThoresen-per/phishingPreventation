Group,
We are 75 mws long for 05/03. 37 mws of length are in the ST-WBOM book and 3=
8=20
mws of length are in the ST-CALI book.  We are long at $183 in SP-15 on=20
peak.  Please buy from the imbalance under the respective books and sell=20
under the same books.  Going forward, we will profit share positions with=20
California by dividing the purchases or sales and putting them in seperate=20
books, so that the number of annuities will be greatly reduced.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
