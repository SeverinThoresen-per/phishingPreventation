SINGAPORE, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com ) - Market pulp trading is growing i=
n China in line with the country's healthy economic growth, but it is slumpi=
ng in Korea as a result of the country's weakening coated woodfree paper exp=
orts to China. Sources said that although buying activity is picking up, Chi=
nese traders are keen to destock their full inventories, putting a stop to a=
ny upward moves for NBSK and radiata pine pulp prices. Spot prices for these=
 two grades have stayed flat at $390-410/tonne and $370-390/tonne, respectiv=
ely, since early July.=20
Mill downtime and reduced woodchip supplies have impeded trading of Indonesi=
an mixed tropical hardwood in Asia. But a flurry of Brazilian eucalyptus to =
the region has filled the gap. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices hav=
e edged up at the lower end to $360-370/tonne, up from $340-370/tonne in mid=
-July. Brazilian eucalyptus prices also shifted up $10/tonne at the lower en=
d of the range, taking prices to US$360-370/tonne. Sources reported that lar=
ge volumes of pulp from Latin America were being shipped to China in July fo=
llowing orders placed earlier. These include Brazilian eucalyptus and radiat=
a pine from Chile. Chinese buyers placed large orders for these grades when =
prices plunged in April.=20
