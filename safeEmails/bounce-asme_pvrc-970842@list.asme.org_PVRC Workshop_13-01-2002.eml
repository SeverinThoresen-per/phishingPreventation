Description

You must attend this workshop to help keep your job knowledge useful by unde=
rstanding the new design rules for bolted flanged joints! Are you ready for =
the New Tightness-Based Gasket constants and flange design changes that are =
about to replace the traditional constants and rules?  This workshop will ge=
t you ready with focus on three critical areas that apply to both ASME Secti=
on VIII flanges and standard B16 Joints.

The New Tightness-Based Rules
Gasket Qualification and Selection
Latest On Analysis and Assembly of Bolted Joints

This Two-Day Workshop is a "must" for those needing  advance information and=
 know-how about applying the recently developed gasket constants and flange =
design rules. The tightness-based rules accommodate levels of permissible jo=
int leakage, representing a new basis for design criteria and opening additi=
onal choices and decisions for users and designers. =20

Attendees will gain detailed knowledge about several topics focussing on the=
 new gasket constants and design rules and particularly on issues relating t=
o leakage criteria and associated choices.  The tightness concept is also ex=
tended to elevated temperature gasket qualification and selection, and know-=
how for efficient joint assembly and making zero leakage plant operation a r=
ealistic goal is presented.  Several industry experts will lead workshop ses=
sions including: Bob Mikitka, Jim Payne, Michel Derenne, Yves Birembaut, Ron=
 winter, Jerry Waterland, Rod Mueller, Anita Bausman, Jim Frew Hildegarde Ze=
res, Warren Brown, Ed Hayman, Bill Koves, and David Reeves. Attendees will r=
eceive a bound collection of the presentations and guidelines and recommenda=
tions.=20
