language at the end of clause (2) thereof and before the semicolon therein:

=10_g(a =10_gNet Payment=10_h), provided, however, that, in the event of the=
 receipt
by a party of a Net Payment due to the failure of a Tax to be an
Indemnifiable Tax because of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority imposing such Tax and
the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient, the
relevant date referred to in clause (x) and (y) above shall be the date
which is sixty days prior to the date on which a Transaction is entered
