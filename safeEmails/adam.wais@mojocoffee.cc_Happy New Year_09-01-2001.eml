Dear Jeff,

Happy New Year!  I hope that all is well with you and that you are enjoying
your new house.  I heard from Merritt that it looks fantastic.  No surprise
there.

How is life outside of work?  Any plans to come to Europe anytime soon?  Any
chance of seeing you in Stockholm or Copenhagen?

Business here is moving along, much to my surprise.  We have raised the
initial money we need to open our first 4 stores, and are trying to raise
the remainder of the money we need to close out our first round of
financing.  I had hoped that we would sign our first lease before the end of
the 00, but it looks like we will sign sometime very soon.  Locations 2-4
should follow very soon thereafter.

Let me know when you will be in Europe next.  Hope all is well, and look
forward to seeing you soon.  Take care,

Adam
