Mark, Sara and Mary:
Jim would like to talk to someone about problems he is having with his=20
customers concerning the ISDA and CSA forms.  Apparently, most of his=20
customers feel that it is too complicated and Jim would like to see if any=20
alternatives exist.  Could someone please contact him?  Thanks.
