I think Dutch Quigley spoke to you about an individual who is trying to get =
set up with EOL for his personal account.  The person is Tony Annunziata fro=
m the Smith Barney AAA fund.  He meets the suitability tests as far as net w=
orth and knowledgable investor.  He is also willing to post via LC or wire. =
 I gave him your number.  I would appreciate if you could expedite his credi=
t application.

Thanks,
John
