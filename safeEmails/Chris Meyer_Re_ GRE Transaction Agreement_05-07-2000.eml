DAN - I've made a few modifications to the above referenced agreement to=20
reflect volume changes and pricing changes associated with the GRE deal.  Th=
e=20
deal structure has been modified to reflect an increase in the DCQ, a  $0.05=
=20
demand charge per DCQ and the ability for GRE to decrease its DCQ monthly.  =
=20
Could you please review the changes I made, as well as clarify that the=20
respective pricing reflects gas purchased "day-ahead", not intraday. =20
Intraday gas sells will be negotiated/ quoted on an "as needed" basis. =20

What does not appear to be addressed in any of the contracts to be executed=20
by ENA and GRE is the agency relationship that will exist whereby ENA will=20
handle nominations, scheduling, invoicing , etc... The intent of our overall=
=20
arrangement with GRE is to provide an agency relationship pursuant to the=20
June 1, 2000 TRANSACTION TERM SHEET.  Is this agency arrangement going to be=
=20
documented separately?  If so, please prepare a draft.  Otherwise, please=20
incorporate into the below agreement language consistent with the June 1st=20
Transaction Term Sheet under the section entitled "OPERATIONS". =20



OSCAR - I've modified the agreement to reflect IF-FOM at Ventura for the DCQ=
=20
and GDA-Common High for all volumes in excess of the DCQ.  Also, as you note=
=20
above, I'm instructing Dan to clarify that this is day ahead gas.  Carl, in=20
his June 23rd term sheet broke out the pricing mechanism to include a "day=20
of" price.  I don't think we should show a price for intraday gas in the=20
Winter.  It will be overly expensive and probably will never be utilized. =20
Also, Carl raises the issue of utilizing third parties when ENA cannot=20
service their account (blancing services, etc...)  Conceptually, I am=20
indifferent, but if they don't use us than we don't nominate or schedule.

Dan,

Great River Energy signed the reimbursement agreement and the transport=20
agreements.

We are trying to finalize the gas deal and I wanted to let you know that=20
Chris Meyer will be getting with you next week to review the transport=20
arrangemet so we can incorporate into the transaction agreement that is part=
=20
of the master.

by copy of this e-mail, I am also requesting Jason to send a copy of a maste=
r=20
agreement to Carl Sulzer for his review.

thanks

Oscar
