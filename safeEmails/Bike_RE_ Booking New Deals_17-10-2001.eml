No problem.  I need to talk to Keith, but it looks like the Price desk may h=
ave a process that would work for us.

Subject:	Booking New Deals

Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and=
 outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we f=
ound last week.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by =
Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must=
 be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person=
 is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures=
 do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will hav=
e an additional "check" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at=
 the same net new deals positions from independent sources.

The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition=
 to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describe=
s the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.

 << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >>=20

The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:

1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financi=
al trades;
2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;
3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through =
the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  =
This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system=
 by Risk.=20

Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we =
decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be dissem=
inated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I=
 am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs =
and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

I will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesd=
ay morning.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.
