Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from=20
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it f=
or
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I=20
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I r=
an
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron schedule=
r)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated las=
t
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.  =20
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.
