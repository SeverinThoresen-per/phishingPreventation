Dear Lloyd & Richard,

I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern=20
that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of=
=20
issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk=20
management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a=20
(by no means exhaustive) list:-

i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic=20
options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different optio=
n=20
pricing add-ins)
ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we=20
can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data=20
for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist=20
in this matter.
iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our=20
methods and systems and vice versa

These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with=20
relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the=
=20
process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative=
=20
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes=20
smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to=20
involve me.

Best regards,
