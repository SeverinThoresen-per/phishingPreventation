Adrianne,

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil C=
arlsson and Thomas Considine.

Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading positi=
on.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based=
 on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation=
 might show a lack of motivation.

Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a =
change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to devel=
op a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would =
be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thom=
as to Houston for further consideration.

Phillip
