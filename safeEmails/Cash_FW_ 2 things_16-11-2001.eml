David, a couple of things:

1. Cheque. Will need to write you a UK cheque, have assumed an FX rate of
1.45 and and the Dollar amount is 77,919.66 , so that makes 53,737.70
Sterling. Who do I need to make the cheque out to? Can you also wait until I
give you the nod next week to cash it? The money should be in the account by
monday, but would like to make certain.

2. Could we draw up something brief in writing to cover our agreement from a
few evenings ago?

Everything hectic at present, we managed to get a removals company at short
notice, a flight back to blighty this weekend, and somewhere to stay in
London. Looking forward to working with the Enron Europe guys again.

Thanks for your help in all of this,

Jonathan
