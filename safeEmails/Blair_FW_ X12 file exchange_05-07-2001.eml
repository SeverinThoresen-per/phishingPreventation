Lynn,
We really need to start the X12 exchanges -- I am sure you will agree in
light of the events over the weekend.  I will push from my end and hopefully
you can push from yours and we can make this happen!

(Hope I see you at the Interconnect Meeting in October.)  I told Cheryl
Snyder to be sure both us were on her invitee list.  I think she'll be
sending out the notice soon.

Happy 4th from Colorado Springs,
Kathy

Kathy,

I have been working on other things.  I will focus on the confirmations
this week and give you and Mike an update.

Tammy and Mike,

What's the status of our X12 file exchange?  Are we ready to implement
this?


Due to the latest problems in communication between our schedulers, we
probably should get this in place as soon as possible.  I believe it
would
streamline the confirmation process between our two pipes.

Let me know what I can do on this side to expedite getting this
going....

Kathy
