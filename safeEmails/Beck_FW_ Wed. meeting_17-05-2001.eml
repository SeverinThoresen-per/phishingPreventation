Here is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.  I told Sharron that you woul=
d be in town and she said that you (and Anna) would certainly be welcome for=
 all or part of the day.  FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adam=
s Mark Hotel.  This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or c=
ab.  I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which thin=
gs you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the=
 entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and he=
ad back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can sched=
ule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --Sally=20
