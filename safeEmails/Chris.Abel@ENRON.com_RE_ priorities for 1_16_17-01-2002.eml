1/15 -=20

curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with P=
wC. I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this=
 at 10 today. We have also had initial discussions with the different risk g=
roups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our del=
iverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to=
 fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the make up of the DPR.=20

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information. So fa=
r, we have only had one request for it. My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are=
 complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time. Chris should have a comple=
te status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!). Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and B=
ridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems =
fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31=
 as soon as all of the information is available. She has also started the ne=
t assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system=
 we can start pulling info by counterparty.

=20

Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate=
), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the di=
fferent buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analys=
is

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.
