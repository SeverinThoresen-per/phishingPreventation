Hello!

I will meet you in the middle. . .work until noon on Friday, and then get ou=
t=20
of here.  It is hard to justify our team taking the entire day off since our=
=20
responsbilities are not completely dependent on daily trading activities or=20
nomination activities.  That, of course, IS TRUE for Logistics and Risk.

To be consistent, I will give the OA team the same info.  Volume Mgmt. and=20
Settlements will be jealous.

Thanks,
Carrie  =20
