Mark:
I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to=20
discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time=20
basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed,=20
which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your=
=20
input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was=20
Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is=20
for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in=
=20
particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set=20
something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and=
=20
was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility=
=20
of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals=
,=20
work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you=
=20
think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some=20
direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group=20
and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it=
=20
seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what=20
work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.

Carol
