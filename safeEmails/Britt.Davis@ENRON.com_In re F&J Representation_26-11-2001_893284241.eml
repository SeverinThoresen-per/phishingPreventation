	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver l=
etter agreement for our review.  I will have copies of that proposed agreeme=
nt circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mari=
ner's GC.  At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC. If the=
re is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know. =20

	Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and ho=
pe that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:

	1.  On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting "Enr=
on Corp. and " between "representation of" and "Enron's affiliates".

	2.  On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, wh=
ich reads as follows:  "Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing =
or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enro=
n Entities herein set forth."  We think, although we do not know for sure, t=
hat F&J's concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some exist=
ing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent,  or that does not cu=
rrently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disq=
ualification based on F&J's current representation of Enron entities.  If th=
is is the reason for the sentence, we don't see how an existing Enron entity=
 or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the =
Enron entity that is actually being represented.

	      We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its "=
affiliates", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it.  Enron C=
orp. may not have the power to require all its "affiliates" to comply.  Our =
suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all th=
e actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner.

	 3.  On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language t=
hat begins, "Without limiting the foregoing..."  It seems to us that here, F=
&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualific=
ation purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F=
&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter.

	3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence,=
 which reads as follows:  "If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly aft=
er receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J sh=
all be entitled..."  Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to=
 an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dyne=
gy may or may not do.  Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to del=
ete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5).

	4.  Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not=
 requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., =
the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp.=
 cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial).  We do not believ=
e that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to t=
ake on the new Mariner matter.  Mariner's GC called me today to advise that =
it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be ab=
le to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is schedul=
ed to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire othe=
r counsel to handle that matter.

	Please let us have your comments as soon as possible.

	Britt
