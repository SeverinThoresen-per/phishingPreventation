Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while=20
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed=20
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement=
=20
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago),=20
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to=20
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the=20
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the=20
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on=20
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and=20
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for=20
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for=20
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better=20
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we receive=
d=20
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your=20
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron b=
y=20
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project=
=20
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal.=
=20
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further=20
assistance.

Andrea

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL=20

heard back from outside counsel.
