Public Relations / e-Biz called regarding the Risk Management Policy, and wa=
nted to know if they could address it in e-Biz. =20

Initially I thought no, but perhaps you might want to take this opportunity =
to highlight other RAC issues of interest to employees.  I was thinking - ma=
ybe the roll out of the RAC website, 3-D data visualization tool recently pr=
ofiled in Risk magazine, etc?

The contact person is Jeanie Mandelker at x36305 if you'd like to discuss it=
 further.  I told her we'd get back to her next week.


Cassandra.
