Louis,

I have entered into the Demand Log the cash payment information for the coun=
terparties listed below.

I have one question:

	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from "Williams En=
ergy Services Company", do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA'=
s relationship with Williams Production RMT????

The above attached file contains validation of payment from:

Cross Oil's on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
San Diego Gas & Electric on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
Stone Energy Corporation on 3/6/02 for the full demand letter amount
Williams Production RMT on 3/5/02 for an amount considerably larger than the=
 demand letter amount ($0.75M paid vs. $0.64 demand)

Please update the Demand Letter Log to reflect that their payment was receiv=
ed.  No termination letter will go to these CPs at this time. =20

Thanks
