Subject: Oman LNG meeting

The meeting with the Oman LNG delegation went well on Saturday, February 10,=
=20
2001. The meeting was attended by delegates from the Oman Ministry and Oman=20
LNG, who were:

1.  Talal Al Aufy - Marketing Director, Ministry Oil & Gas, Oman,
2.  T. V. Suresh - Advisor, Ministry of National Economy, Oman,
3.  Harib Al Kitani - Head of Marketing, OLNG,
4.  Ms. Susan Farmer - Lawyer for OLNG (from Denton Wide Sapte in London),=20

and Enron representatives: Jim Hughes, Wade Cline, Neil McGregor, Mohan=20
Gurunath, Paul Kraske, Mukesh Tyagi, Rick Bergsieker (Global LNG team) and=20
myself.

Mohan Gurunath made the presentation, which contained the same information=20
that we have shared with the lenders. The delegation asked questions, and th=
e=20
Enron representatives, mostly Jim and Wade, shared their views on the issues=
=20
facing DPC. Generally, the discussion included a description of the makeup=20
and expectations of the expert committee, and the need for the central=20
government's involvement in resolving some of the problems related to the=20
demand-supply of power, cost of power, transmission and distribution losses,=
=20
power trading and sale to third parties. The discussion included a=20
description of the security package. DPC noted that the outcome of=20
discussions with the expert committee, state and central governments, and=20
MSEB may require the PPA to be adjusted and the equity sponsors to realise=20
less of a return on their capital.=20

The parties did not discuss any specifics as to how or what will be the=20
impact on the Oman LNG supply contract as a result of the discussions and=20
resolution of issues between MSEB/DPC. Certainly no concessions for relief o=
f=20
the LNG supply contract obligations were offered by the Oman team (and none=20
were or are expected). Clearly, the point made by DPC to the Oman team was=20
that it was too early to discuss specifics, but that DPC would need to=20
revisit the matter with the Oman team as and when developments occurred and=20
events became clearer in the future. The Oman team asked what help they coul=
d=20
be to DPC in the Oman team's discussion with the central government.  DPC=20
asked the Oman team to emphasize that the Oman government has made=20
significant investments in Oman for the supply of gas to the DPC project, an=
d=20
that Oman urged and expected that the contracts between the various parties=20
and DPC will be enforced and observed, and that the failure to enforce the=20
contracts would be observed by Oman, and also by other countries and=20
businesses in the world.=20

The Oman team inquired about the status of the MetGas project and, generally=
=20
about the gas market in India. DPC explained that MetGas is being put on hol=
d=20
until such time that the DPC controversy is settled. The Oman team=20
understands that the MetGas business is being preserved, and that Enron will=
=20
determine its MetGas investment strategy after discussions regarding DPC are=
=20
finalised with MSEB and the state and central governments. The discussion=20
included speculation on what various people thought may happen with other LN=
G=20
terminal projects in India, and the possible related business connection or=20
competition with the DPC terminal. Most people concurred that the DPC=20
terminal could be used for serving a backbone gas pipeline business in India=
,=20
that open access/carrier should be encouraged, and that it is possible thoug=
h=20
not likely that the another LNG terminal will materialise on the West Coast=20
of India. The Oman team expressed that they are hearing that an LNG terminal=
=20
in the state of Gujurat is still being pursued by Petronet with the support=20
from the state owned gas pipeline company (GSPL).
