We (Mike Gough, plant manager, Mike Mazowita and various Westinghouse "SWPC"=
=20
commercial folks) have had a few lengthy discussions concerning the February=
,=20
April and August outages.  The current issues and their status is as follows=
:

Outstanding Invoices:  The Feb and April invoices total to $1,627,541.81. =20
The breakdown is 2 times $420,388.06 Labor and $786,765.69 Parts.  We have=20
analysed the Parts invoices and have determined that the calculation=20
correctly (or favourably in some cases) determines the correct useful life=20
charge.

Tenaska Invoice Dispute:  Tenaska asserted that they should not be required=20
to pay either the parts or the labor for these outages (and would have held=20
similar for the August outage).  The parts which were the source of the=20
failure, the transition pieces and seals (including allocable labor), were=20
noted on the invoices as "Warranty."  The invoices were for the "actually=20
used life" for the repaired/replaced components as well as the incremental=20
labor associated with replacing these components.  Tenaska believes the=20
incremental should be covered under consequential damages under either the=20
warranty provisions of the maintenance agreement or the individually signed=20
labor agreements.  SWPC contends that there is no consequential damage=20
concept in either agreement.

Temporary resolution as of today:  We have agreed with SWPC to pay all parts=
=20
life charges and hold aside the labor charge in escrow pending legal review.=
 =20
The review and either concurrence with SWPC or Tenaska needs to be reached=20
immediately.  I would like Richard Sanders of legal to spearhead this review=
=20
and deliver a preliminary view by cob tomorrow.  We will execute some form o=
f=20
escrow and or payment depending upon Richard's determination.

Power Systems root cause analysis:  We will have PS at the site during next=20
weeks outage and will be required to pay for 1 full 8 hours of shift=20
downtime.  Once we know the legal review from 3 above, I will inform SWPC of=
=20
this issue.  The plant personnel already know and will fully cooperate.

At this time, I would not expect that we have a potential disclosure issue o=
n=20
the invoices (certainly open to change).
