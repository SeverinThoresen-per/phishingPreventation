Scott asked for some assistance on the booking of the LGS deal and the impac=
t=20
it would have if we unwound certain hedges. To help me better understand the=
=20
impact this would have, I need to understand the way we originally booked th=
e=20
deal.   David, you and I have talked about this some, but I still don't have=
=20
all the info I need.  (Let me know if Scott, Craig and Farzad have already=20
figured all this out and I'll drop it, but to my knowledge they still need=20
help figuring this all out).  Hopefully my thoughts outlined below will help=
=20
you understand what I'm looking for and why.

As I understand the LGS deal, ENA pays an annual $1.35 MM to utilize the=20
assets, including storage; ENA gets to keep value generated (including=20
summer/winter spread) up to $1.5MM, then it is shared 50/50; however, LGS ha=
s=20
to know about and agree with any hedges we put on to lock in a particular=20
spread.  When Structuring booked this deal in January, summer/winter spreads=
=20
were locked in for the entire period we have the deal (through 2003);=20
however, it is my understanding that LGS has only been made aware of the=20
front year hedges (which I understand have been changed around a bit since=20
the beginning and that's o.k.).   =20

What I need to know is--how was this deal booked?  When the $1.35 MM payment=
=20
goes to LGS, is that covered through the hedges that were put on?  How=20
exactly do the dollars flow between books?

I think this will help us figure out what would fall out If Scott removes=20
certain forward hedges and what risk he would take on.  It seems to me that=20
he would be at risk for whatever spread we had locked in originally, but I'm=
=20
not sure exactly how this would show up.  Basically, it seems as if Scott is=
=20
at risk with the hedges on, that if the actual spread is wider by the time=20
LGS is informed of the injection/withdrawal schedule (or LGS begins pushing=20
us to put on hedges), he would lose; likewise, it seems that if he takes the=
=20
hedges off and the actual spread comes in tighter, he would lose. =20
Conversely, if he takes the hedges off and the actual spread comes in wider,=
=20
I think he would win.  Anyway, I want to get together on Monday and go over=20
this with the three of you and figure this all out.  Please let me know if=20
10:00 Monday morning (7/31) works for you, then I'll ask Kim to get a=20
conference room.
