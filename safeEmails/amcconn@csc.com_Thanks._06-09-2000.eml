Ben,
Thanks for having us up to Beaver Creek this weekend.  We had a wonderful
time.  I told Raul that Colorado needs to be our vacation every summer bc
this was our best one by far!  Anyway, it was a fun spending time with you
guys and your parents in such a relaxing place.

We need to get together soon and share pictures.  Also, I don't know if I
can go that long without laughing with and at you!

Tell Megan thanks too!
Amy
