Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counter=
party FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankr=
uptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if yo=
u need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterd=
ay, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yest=
erday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to =
go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are n=
ot in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should b=
e in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) =
or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (1667=
64) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201=
), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or E=
NA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks
