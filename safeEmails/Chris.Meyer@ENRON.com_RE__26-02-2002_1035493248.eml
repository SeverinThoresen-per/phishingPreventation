Joe - talked w/ Zisman about Centana this p.m.  He agrees that so long as th=
e party ENA shorted is different from the counter party on the implied stora=
ge agreement, then they are on shaky ground....and run the risk of blowing u=
p the entire deal.  My sense is that should they desire to hold in escrow ad=
ditional amounts (without the estate agreement)  they are exercising set off=
 rights w/ affiliated ownership under an implied storage lease agreement.  T=
hat is some seriously bad ju ju (translated...they better think again).

I am going to push for cash committee approval tomorrow or Thursday as discu=
ssed yesterday.  Shemin should have her revised doc this p.m. or tomorrow a.=
m.
