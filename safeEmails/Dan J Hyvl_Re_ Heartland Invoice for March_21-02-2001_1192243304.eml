Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last=20
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next=20
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back=20
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas=20
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the=20
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase=
=20
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher tha=
t=20
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that=
=20
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the=20
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and=20
trueup each month for the prior months activity. =20

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

Subject: Heartland Invoice for March

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for=20
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we stil=
l=20
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  Th=
e=20
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the=20
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck
