Sometimes I clown a lot and I never really say that you are a very unique an=
d
special person in my life. I feel that without you sometimes I would have a
complete void that would yearn to be filled. I really care about you more
than you could ever imagine. I have the utmost respect for you and I will
never do anything that will jeapodize our relationship and friendship,
however I am committed to wait on you for an eternity. I am very pateint,
simply because I know what you add and mean to my life, though it is hard no=
t
seeing you, I know that if you could you would, but that does not stop me
from wanting you in my arms and presence.
                                            Charles
