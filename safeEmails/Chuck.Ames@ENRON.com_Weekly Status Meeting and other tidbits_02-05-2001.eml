Geoff,

	The weekly status meeting with the IT guys took place as scheduled on Monda=
y afternoon.  The main issues are as follows:

Dave would like to sit down and discuss the requirements for the customizabl=
e time periods on the pos manager.
Reaffirmation of taking all the components in Phase I into production by the=
 middle of the month.
Roll up aggregation for curve shift as well as position
FX Price column in the positions as well as group of groups requirements,

The issues that they are currently facing is the FX Price column in the posi=
tions as well as group of groups requirements.  I think they would like to s=
it down with you and discuss on Monday to get a better sense of the exact re=
quirements.  I'm not entirely sure as to what the question is on the FX colu=
mn, but they said they'd like to speak with you on Monday either way. =20

As far as my own work is concerned, I loaded the GDI curves for the Central =
and West desks on Monday.  However, I still need to create a process whereby=
 that is done directly.  Ahmad is working on developing the capabilities in =
the current sheets for you, Andy and Martin.  In the meantime, we can just l=
isten to the current index curves being published and just use those to load=
 into ERMS.  I still do not have access in ERMS test environment but I hope =
to have that by tomorrow.  It seems like they finally got around to fixing t=
he TDS ticker in parallel.  I do have a few questions for you, however.  Fir=
st, is there any need to see deals done for the current day in the deal tick=
er?  I assume you should as a way to see your daily physical trades and the =
effect on the inherent position for that day and beyond.  Also, there is som=
e issue with the deal valuation in the position manager.  I'm trying to figu=
re out exactly what Nayan is pulling out to value the physical positions.  T=
he question is moot, however, once we have the live feeds in place for the p=
hysicals and gas daily's.  The IM positions have been moved out of the posit=
ions tab in the manager.  Mike has made some changes to value options in the=
 deal ticker which was rolled out late this afternoon.  This has not yet bee=
n tested.  I have to get access to all the books in parallel, but will get i=
t in the morning.  We are having problems with calc'ing current+prompt for t=
he physical positions into TDS.  I'll be contacting Jeremy Wong in the morni=
ng and ask him about the port calc errors.  We also still have to test the G=
DI calcs in ERMS test.  Russ is still testing the TDS tradeblotter in test. =
 I will also continue in reconciling the physical sitara positions with the =
TDS load.  As you can see, theres plenty of work to go around.  I apologize =
for the rambling nature of this email, but it is currently approaching 11 pm=
 and we are still working to correctly pull positions into the morning packe=
t.  I'll send a much more coherent and concise response tomorrow.  Talk to y=
ou soon.  Hope the wife and baby are doing well.

Chuck=20
