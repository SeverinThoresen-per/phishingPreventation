Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet=20
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have=
=20
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you=
=20
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you=20
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to=20
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They=
=20
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above=20
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress fo=
r=20
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypres=
s.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

=46rom Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246=20
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the=20
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we=20
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch o=
r=20
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly=20
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event=
=20
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need th=
e=20
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preference=
s=20
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered=
=20
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is=
=20
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are on=
e=20
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

Craig =20
