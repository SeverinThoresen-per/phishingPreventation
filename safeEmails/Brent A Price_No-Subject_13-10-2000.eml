This goes to a discussion I had with Jeff this morning.  We have had IT=20
problems of some sort or another every day this week which has prevented us=20
from getting the daily reports out by 8:30 (our target time with Jeff).  I=20
have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to=20
reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT=20
perspective.  The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a=20
different problem every day (metacalc, servers going down, Lotus Notes=20
problems...).  I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate. =
=20
I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that=20
these problems do not continue.

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM. =20
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too=20
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you=20
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas. =20

Thanks.

Jeff
