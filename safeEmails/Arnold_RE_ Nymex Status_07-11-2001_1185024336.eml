John,=20

I met with Bo last Thurs and continued the discussion today with Bo, David K=
eller (Nymex CTO), David Salomon (Nymex), Brad Richter and Jay Webb.  Nymex =
indicated that they would like to move ahead very quickly on getting a price=
 posting arrangement with them on Access where they will be showing prices a=
ll day including the OTC products.  Once this is complete they would also li=
ke to contemplate an arrangement on a Phase 2 technology sale with them.  Th=
ey are currently scoping our the Phase II requirements.

Nymex does not have the resources to build the API (interface with EnronOnli=
ne) and would like us to do the development.  This type of arrangement requi=
res the desk to make some decisions:

Are we willing to post numbers on Access electronically and have the transac=
tion occur on Access?  This will give us the risk of being double hit.=20
Are we willing to dedicate technology resources to this effort (and away fro=
m other EnronOnline priorities) and will the desk get enough benefits to jus=
tify the opportunity costs?=20
What would it take for you to post numbers in this fashion (fees, preferenti=
al fills, etc).  You have the original specialist proposal we sent to them.


We indicated to Bo that we would get an answer on this and call in the next =
couple of days.  If we can answer these questions, Jay will have someone loo=
k at the Access code and determine the cost to us (development time).

We will also be meeting with Nymex next Wed to talk about Phase II.  We thin=
k that we can structure a transaction that would include an Access Price Pos=
ting in the short term, Specialist role and an obligation to look at our Pha=
se II proposal.  If we do not get a firm commitment on Phase II within a spe=
cified period we can review our specialist role and ask them to pay for the =
API we built to access.

Please call me to discuss at 713 853-0397. =20
