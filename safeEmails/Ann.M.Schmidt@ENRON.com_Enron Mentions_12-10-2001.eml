UK: UK Coalpower keen for 500MW station at Hatfield.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Coalpower, the company set up by former RJB Minin=
g chief Richard Budge, says it would like to build a coal-fired power statio=
n near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire, northern Eng=
land.=20
"We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking =
to various people", Budge told Reuters on Thursday, adding the chances of su=
ch a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Br=
itain's current review of its energy needs to 2050.
"Let's see what comes out of the energy review - if it's positive for coal g=
asification it will not just be our plant that will be built, others will be=
=2E"=20
Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition=
 from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spend=
ing about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production.=20
Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100=
 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in =
excess of 500,000 tonnes a year.=20
"Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant",=
 said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced an=
d diverse energy portfolio.=20
The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence=
 on imported natural gas.=20
Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, =
which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. But gasification=
 combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most o=
f the impurities are removed prior to combustion.=20
Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the env=
ironmental concerns of burning coal.=20
Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still a=
ccounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to =
the industry enjoying a mini revival.=20
A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to=
 a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel =
in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled =
prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.

Enron backs away from Coburg plant

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

COBURG, Ore. (AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas po=
wer plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday.=20
But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglome=
rate will not stop the project.
"Enron never drove this deal," he said. "I invited Enron into the deal."=20
Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design=
 but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new=
 backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project=
 within a year.=20
Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcu=
s said.=20
Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment.=20
Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that t=
he power plant will harm ground water and air quality.=20
"I don't think it'll ever be built," said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project=
 opponent. "If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it=
, it won't be."=20
Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, =
"We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."=20
The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for constructio=
n of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainde=
r of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation.=20
An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that C=
oburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require addition=
al permits that might delay the project.=20
Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also wo=
uld add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent =
of all power currently consumed in Lane County.=20
Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 millio=
n. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.

India: Enron may seek $30 m to exit Greenfield

NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exit=
ing from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlant=
ic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner.=20
While Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol P=
ower Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood t=
o have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers fa=
miliar with the developments told Business Line.
The $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $1=
1 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the=
 loan liabilities, the sources said.=20
Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulli=
ng out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the pr=
oject lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent i=
n view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company.=20
The State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner i=
n Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture co=
nsortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines.=20
In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the L=
NG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tr=
anche of the project loan worth $55 million. The ANZ Investment Bank-led con=
sortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of=
 $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mit=
subishi's yard in Japan.=20
The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tu=
ne of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery=
 date of November 15.=20
The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in ext=
ra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times. A board =
meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Governme=
nt sources said.=20
SCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around =
the fate of Enron's equity in the deal. In the event of Enron pulling out of=
 the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken ove=
r by the two remaining partners. Besides, these two partners would also have=
 to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in =
proportion to their revised equity holdings.=20
"However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should =
agree to take over the equity of Enron", the sources said.=20
During discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lend=
ers that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG s=
hipping deal.=20
Moreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 =
to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol=
 Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rate=
s would render their investments unviable.=20
According to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfiel=
d is expected to earn about $22 million per annum. Out of this, $4-$5 millio=
n will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker.=20
The remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of =
7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent.=20
"Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investm=
ents", the sources said.=20
Whereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent. "T=
his will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects in=
volving State-funding," the sources said.=20

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Thursday its =
new system for running fiber-optic cable through natural gas pipelines, in t=
urn leaving city streets intact, could begin commercial service in December.=
=20
Putting fiber-optic lines in existing natural gas pipelines - which already =
have cleared rights-of-way - could tackle the telecommunications industry's =
"last mile" problem of connecting end users to outlying fiber-optic cable ne=
tworks without tearing up roadways.
A surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications =
companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic syste=
ms that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than traditional =
copper wires.=20
Sempra Fiber Links, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, made the announ=
cement after its first installation of the technology in the gas distributio=
n system of Frontier Energy, a Sempra Energy unit in North Carolina.=20
Sempra's technology involves encasing fiber-optic cable in a protective poly=
ethylene conduit before inserting it through the same local gas lines servin=
g utility customers.=20
The company said installing the cable would not prevent a utility from servi=
cing its gas lines or keeping them safe.=20
Jennifer Andrews, a Sempra Fiber Links spokeswoman, said the company was dis=
cussing its fiber-in-gas system with gas utilities throughout the United Sta=
tes.=20
SAVINGS=20
Andrews said companies using the technology could save from 30 percent to 50=
 percent on last mile costs compared with traditional trenching and installa=
tion methods.=20
Sempra Energy unit Southern California Gas Co., one of the largest gas utili=
ties in the U.S. with about 18 million customers, plans to use fiber-in-gas =
technology in its system as soon as it is approved by the California Public =
