Lydia - would you please pass this on to Andy Zipper.

Andy, my name is Kevin Morrissey.  I work on special
projects for a couple of our executives, and have been
designated point person for Enron opportunities.
First Data Corp is a processing company and money movement
company. We own Western Union, which passes billions of
dollars, and do the processing and settlement for credit
cards-doing over half of all Visa and Master Card. We pass
and settle trillions of dollars a year.  We have a very
large network with banks and financial institutions.
We started doing some processing for Enron Energy Services a
year ago, and think there are other opportunities for both
our companies.  I would like to spend some time with you
understanding Enron On Line to see what we might do for each
other.(Lou Casari  gave me your name - he said you were the
best person to explain EOL). I will be in Houston next week
and wonder if you have some time to meet with me on Tuesday
May 29 or Wednesday May 30. I have some open time 3-5 PM on
both days. If you could leave me a message, or have Lydia
leave me a call at 303-488-8226, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.
Looking forward to meeting you.
