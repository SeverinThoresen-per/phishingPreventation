Dave heard back from Terry Spencer of OneOk today that OneOk has changed its=
 position on a couple of key issues.  First, Terry indicated that OneOk now =
agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past =
period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and=
 that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It =
is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, bu=
t any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that One=
Ok is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolv=
ing the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters ar=
e OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call =
a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall. =20

Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their posit=
ion.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agr=
eed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.  Once=
 Dave gets it, we'll all take a look and decide the next step.  Thanks.  DF =
