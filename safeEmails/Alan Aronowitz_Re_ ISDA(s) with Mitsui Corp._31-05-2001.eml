Thanks for the help Alan.  Moving forward though, if it turns out that Londo=

what do we do about Mitsui's concern that it doesn't want to have separate=20

What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  Seems to me that from the=20

Lets talk tomorrow morning.

Matt/Edmund,

Laurie and I are trying to help Jane determine if an ISDA with Mitsui Corp.=20
has been negotiated by London and Singapore.  Tana Jones has checked the=20
Financial Trading Agreements database and found no records of an ISDA with=20
Mitsui.  Do you by any chance no if such agreement has been negotiated and=20
perhaps is waiting to be entered into the database?  If an ISDA does exist=20
with Mitsui, would you be so kind to contact Jane directly with details, etc=
=2E

Thanks and regards,

Nony

No ISDA for Mitsui Corp.  Below is the link which should enable you view=20
access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  You can forward this=20
email with the link to any member of your team and they will then have the=20
link which will get them access to the database.
