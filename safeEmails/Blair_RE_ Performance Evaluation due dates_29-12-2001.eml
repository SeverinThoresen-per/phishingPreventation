	In talking with Fran we need to have Written Reviews to HR by COB January 2=
, 2002.  The reviews
	do not need to be signed by either party.  We can start communicating revie=
ws to the employees
	at any time.  But there should be no discussion on bonus or merit until the=
y are finalized on or
	around January 18.  Thanks. Lynn

Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by =
January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the=
 discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance re=
view meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks and have a great holiday! =20
