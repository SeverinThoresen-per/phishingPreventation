Campbell,

We had a discrepancy with WESCO on our checkouts for 9/23/2001.  WESCO shows=
 all 100 MW with the following path:

SCEG-SCEGW135074F50/50-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-SOCOW/S

WESCO does not recognize the schedule with the following path for 25MW:

MDU-CARGILL-MAPPW-AMRNW-TVAW-CARG-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-=
SOCOW/S =20

We both agree that 100 MW should sink at SOCO, however, they show all 100 co=
ming from SCEG into SOCO, and we show 75 from SCEG to SOCO and 25 from MDU t=
o SOCO.  Let me know if I need to make any changes.

Thanks,

Jason Berlin
