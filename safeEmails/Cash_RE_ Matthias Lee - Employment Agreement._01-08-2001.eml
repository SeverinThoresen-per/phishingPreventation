FYI.

Have you reviewed the suggestions/comments raised?

Also, I did not know that HR in Singapore had shown the draft to Matt.

Chor Lim has been working with me on my draft Employment Agreement (which is=
 quite different from the Singapore Employment Agreement I have seen). Chor =
Lim forwarded amendments for Houston's consideration yesterday (see Chor Lim=
's e-mail below), but she was re-sent the original draft overnight (without =
comment on the amendments) advising that you will be speaking to me about it=
 in our call tomorrow. I'm not sure if you have seen the amendments, so I re=
quested Chor Lim for a copy for your reference.

Looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Regards
Matt
