Great.  Thanks for the info.  I'm happy to see you working on some analysis!=
 =20

We're working on a project for email alerts/notifications etc. which should =
be sweet when it's done - I think
this would be a good place for collaboration, although we're designing somet=
hing fairly complex. =20

also, a possibly very good solution to load/resource balance performance wou=
ld be to use an OLAP backend. =20
you should definitely consider this when you're working on things.  If you g=
o to albertapower and select the=20
Data Summaries (tabular) link you can go to some pivot tables we have on lin=
e which should give you some
idea of the speed gain from olap (it's a pain in the ass, but you have to ad=
d "http://albertapower" and "http://albertapower.enron.com"
to your "trusted sites" in the Tools->Internet Options->Security section.  y=
ou may also have to futz with the=20
various settings under the "trusted sites" category.  if you take a look, bu=
t can't get past the errors, give me a call
and i'll walk you through it. =20

Hi Cooper,
I forgot to tell you, I did some FTR analysis back at the beginning of the y=
ear which was really interesting.  I also did some hydro flows analysis to f=
orecast when the runoff would start picking up.  I did this by looking at pr=
evious years unregulated flows and average temperatures for Spokane and Kali=
spell and discovered that the flows increase dramatically approximately two =
months after the average temps reach above freezing on a continuous daily ba=
sis.  In addition to the Cal ISO OASIS conversion, I'm currently working on =
a webpage that will allow individuals to sign up for various e-mail alerts/n=
otifications.  I'm also studying the load/resource balance and tweaking it t=
o make it faster (i.e. through indexes, rewriting SQL code to promote optimi=
zation, etc.), more robust, and fully automated (through Perl and S-Plus). =20
