I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have=20
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of=20
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we=
=20
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handlin=
g=20
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks
