Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and g=
et approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have w=
e done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this tick=
et?

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.=
  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which i=
ncludes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the =
volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing inform=
ation from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  Th=
is deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service an=
d Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313=
,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Brid=
geline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal right=
s if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this w=
ill not create a confirmation.
