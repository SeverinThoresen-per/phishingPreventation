All,

Earlier today, an individual at Enron was contacted by someone claiming to b=
e Jackie Buckhold (HR) from Dynegy.  The caller was requesting a copy of an =
organisational chart.  Evidence now seems to point in the direction that the=
 caller was not Jackie Buckhold at all, but a recruitment consultant.

Please be aware that we should be exceptionally careful when providing infor=
mation externally to maintain the confidentiality of Enron.  This is a commo=
n tactic of recruitment agencies, please emphasise to your staff that all ex=
ternal requests for internal information should be passed through yourselves=
 or HR.

thanks and regards,

Lucy
