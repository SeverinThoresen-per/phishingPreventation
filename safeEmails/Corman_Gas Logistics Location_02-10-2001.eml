Pam,

Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott &=
 Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all invol=
ved. =20

On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern th=
at the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Al=
lison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; includi=
ng the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling syst=
em is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting=
 customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logi=
stics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer tra=
nsactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.

I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves=
 or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am p=
ursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these=
 issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logi=
stics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.=
   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now t=
hat that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor rem=
odeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group.
