Aaron, does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership inter=
est, but that may not be a "subsidiary"?  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle,

This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensat=
ion Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all fo=
rmations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity pl=
ans.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to g=
et this done.  Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to t=
he Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR in=
terests are scrubbed.

These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need t=
o be worked out and change regularly.  Also, it is very important that no wr=
itten or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committ=
ee approval is obtained.

Regards,
Aaron
