I don't think anything has changed.  I just wanted to be sure I had the righ=
t understanding.
Ava can certainly help out where needed.  Thanks. Lynn

Shelley has never requested anyone to cover for her.  I have asked her befor=
e if she required coverage, and she told me no, and its because she is so se=
lf sufficient.  If she needs anything, she ususally asks Ava, since she is t=
he closest and I always take my lap top with me.

Have things changed and no one told me?

Thank you,
Ricki

Thanks for understanding,
