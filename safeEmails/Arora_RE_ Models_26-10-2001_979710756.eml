Iris

what is the difference between this spark spread function call and the one b=
eing used in the spreadsheets we use ?

Hi Slava,

	Paulo says you have some questions about what we're doing with spark spread=
s.

	He did not give me any specifics as to what you needed.  Give me at call at=
 X3-6711 for more details.

	In the mean time, I have been developing exotic options modules/tutorials f=
or the power trading floor.  One of the modules is on spark spreads  - pleas=
e see attached file.

=09
Regards,
Iris

Iris:
I think you are the expert on how we are trading spark spreads (if we are do=
ing any). Slava wants to know more about it. I appreciate if you contact him=
 directly.=20
Many Thanks.
Paulo Issler

Paulo,

thank you very much.=20
we will look at all your work.

just to remind you on spark spread options.

many thanks,

Slava

Slava:
Here are the files related to the models I mentioned in our phone coversatio=
n.

FwdFwd Vols:

Here is a spreadshet implementing a technique for calculating fwd fwd volati=
lities for seasonal vol curves. The approach avoids the issue of geting nega=
tive fwd fwd variances when using the traditional approach. It makes necessa=
ry, however, to develop a specific fwd fwd vol curve for each contract month=
=2E=20

Here is how it works:
	1) Create a variance curve: Var =3D vol*vol*(Ti-t)
	2) Fit a desoasonalized curve with functional form: y =3D a*(t^b)
	3) calculate fwd-fwd variances for the desoasonal curve:
	4) Calculate fwd-fwd vols for each month by multiplying the=20
	    fwd-fwd variance curve by a factor equal to:
			SQRT(Var(Contract Month)/Var(fit))


 << File: FwdFwd.xls >>=20
I implemented a C code for calculating that. This, with the omicron vols may=
 be used to model the gas curve evolution in a HJM framework.

 << File: fwdfwd.c >>  << File: FwdFwdw.c >>=20

Swing Options:
Here is the code and documentation for the swing option:

 << File: XLCALL32.LIB >>  << File: bico.c >>  << File: factln.c >>  << File=
: FRAMEWRK.C >>  << File: FRAMEWRK.H >>  << File: FSSwing.c >>  << File: FSS=
wingOpt.c >>  << File: FXSwing.c >>  << File: FXSwingOpt.c >>  << File: gamm=

>>  << File: SwingOpt.def >>  << File: SwingOptW.c >>  << File: SwingW.c >> =
 << File: XLCALL.H >>  << File: Bdt.c >>  << File: Swing Model.doc >>=20
Here are the spreadshets examples:

 << File: FSSwingOpt.xls >>  << File: FXSwingOpt.xls >>=20
LookBack:
Here is my implementation for the lookback option with fixed strike. It uses=
 an analytical solution in which prices are sampled continiously over time. =
It still provides a good approximation for a discrete daily sampling:

 << File: XLCALL32.LIB >>  << File: Cumnorm.c >>  << File: framewrk.c >>  <<=
 File: framewrk.h >>  << File: FxLKBK.c >>  << File: FxLKBK.def >>  << File:=
 Integration.c >>  << File: lkbkTEST.xls >>  << File: nrutil.c >>  << File: =
nrutil.h >>  << File: put.c >>  << File: xFxLKBK.c >>  << File: XLCALL.H >> =
 << File: call.c >>=20
Let me know if you got them all.
Give me a call with your questions/concerns.
Thanks.
Paulo Issler
