Theresa,

Hope that all is well with you in Denver and that your trip to Houston last =
week was a pleasant one.  I was out Thurs. and Friday, but Anne was telling =
me that you guys did a deal with Kennedy Oil.  Do you have the Sitara deal #=
's for that deal.  I need to link them up to the Tagg deal. Thanks.
