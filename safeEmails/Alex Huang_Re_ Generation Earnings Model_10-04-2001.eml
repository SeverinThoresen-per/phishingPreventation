Michelle,
I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked=20
earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts=
=20
and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results=
=2E
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but=20
does not solve the problem.=20

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is=20
optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as =
C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Best,
Alex

Hi Alex-

Danielle and I were talking to David M. today regarding running the model fo=
r=20
purposes of back testing the results. Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days=
=20
of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration=
=20
run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of=20
data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are=20
concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be=20
increased to at least 500 iterations.=20

We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful=
=20
than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to=
=20
how we can improve the process?

Thanks,
Michelle
