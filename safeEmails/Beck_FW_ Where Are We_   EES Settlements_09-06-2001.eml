Subject:	Where Are We?   EES Settlements=20

When I sent this e:mail on Monday, I committed two things for this week:  a =
preliminary review of our more detailed plan with the traders (Belden, Black=
, Presto and Rogers) by mid week and a final proposal of roles and responsib=
ilitiies by the end of this week to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  It is =
4:30 pm Friday, and as far as I can tell we have not delivered on either com=
mitment this week.  I didn't hear from the three of you that you couldn't ma=
ke these time commitments, so I did not reset expectations. =20

We must need to reset expectations now.  Can we plan to complete this by Mon=
day afternoon (June 11th) so that I can get back with all interested parties=
 that attended the June 4 lunch meeting?  Do the four of us need to meet bri=
efly this afternoon ( I will stay as late as necessary) or on Monday morning=
 to clarify what needs to be done?  How can I help move this forward?  This =
topic commanded an hour and a half of Delainey and Lavorato's time at lunch =
on the 4th, so it is important to them.  --Sally =20

Subject:	EES Settlements - Follow Up

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn R=
uffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discus=
sed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS wou=
ld assume internal management of the settlements function, including managin=
g data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would reta=
in the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plu=
s serving as the interface with EES customers. =20

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendat=
ions from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of ro=
les and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function bef=
ore the end of this week. =20

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --S=
ally   (x35926)  =20
