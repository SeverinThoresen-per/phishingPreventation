Jeff,

I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to d=
o work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,=
35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay=
 for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from anot=
her mason. =20

I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return=
 for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want t=
o have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the=
 utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that =
month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.

If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap th=
ings up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the =
utilities still need to be transferred.

Phillip
