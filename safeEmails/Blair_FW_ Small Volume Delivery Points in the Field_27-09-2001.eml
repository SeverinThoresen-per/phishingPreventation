Subject:	Small Volume Delivery Points in the Field

I would like at host a meeting to discuss new small volume delivery points i=
n the field.  The Business Development group has at least three requests fro=
m different entities for new delivery points.  The issues to be discussed at=
 the meeting include type of measurement to be installed at the point, appli=
cability of DDVCs. balancing, OBAs and a host of other issues.  These small =
volume points take an extraordinary amount of time for many departments and =
produce a very small amount of revenue for ETS.  Anything that can be done t=
o simplify the process would be a cost benefit to ETS. =20

The meeting details are as follows:


	Day			Wednesday
	Date			October 10, 2001
	Time 			3:00 P.M.
	Location		Houston EB 42C2   (relocation of the video conference facilities)
				Omaha 696


I look forward to receiving your input at the meeting.  Please free to forwa=
rd this meeting notice to anyone you think would like to be involved in this=
 process that I have missed.  Thanks
