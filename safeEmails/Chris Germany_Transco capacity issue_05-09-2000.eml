With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more=20
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we=
=20
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the=20
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would=20
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the=20
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the=20
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt=
=20
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it=
=20
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impac=
t=20
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let=20
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
