Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to fi=
nd willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-=
time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to m=
arket sources.=20
"It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying fr=
om it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/=
Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan St=
anley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker e=
stimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it =
was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and=
 power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a mon=
th later poses no credit risk for the buyer.=20
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP=
 PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dyn=
egy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal=
 are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California uti=
lity-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also =
are trading with Enron.=20
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very li=
mited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals do=
ne long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tra=
ctebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker sa=
id.=20
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at price=
s lower than Enron was offering.=20
"They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader.=20
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions=20

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but n=
ot to 25% of the one-month-ago level.=20
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8=
 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume dat=
a for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information t=
wo weeks ago.=20
"We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day r=
olling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of dai=
ly volatility," Thode said.=20
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee =
to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to tran=
sact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companie=
s must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and =
completed.=20
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concer=
ns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left it=
s bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt.=20
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the=
 late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exc=
hange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ag=
o, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear th=
at Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on t=
he quarterly filing.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch abo=
ve speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade,=
 and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rati=
ng "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends =
on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.=20

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday i=
t was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger=
, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price=
 may be slashed some 40 percent.=20
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the t=
ransaction related to the deal," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. H=
e declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is c=
urrently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial books=
 that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday.=20
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.4=
1 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4=
, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at a=
ll.=20
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally pro=
posed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to aroun=
d 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is will=
ing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, th=
e sources said.=20
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, =
trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock =
Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and=
 as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.0=
8 on the NYSE.=20
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt pas=
t the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The source=
s said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 milli=
on in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking.=20
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern =
Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal =
fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks=
 J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as c=
ollateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal bre=
aks up.=20
"The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized=
=2E There's a solid earnings stream from that thing," said one source famili=
ar with the discussions.=20
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN=20
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been t=
old it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being lai=
d off. Enron was not immediately available for comment.=20
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyou=
t, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier t=
rading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactio=
ns with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns.=20
"This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the p=
rincipal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less the=
n Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading a=
nd marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade.=20
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dyn=
egy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. E=
nron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 =
billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet =
McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its ac=
quisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains =
too risky.=20
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to re=
structure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the nego=
tiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a l=
ower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional fundi=
ng for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they contin=
ue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares r=
ecently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed h=
ands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%.=20
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685=
 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current tradin=
g levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price.=20
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an =
exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion.=20
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability t=
o carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves =
toward completion, the person said.=20
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it wil=
l take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as =
arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion=
=2E=20
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acq=
uiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hop=
e to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer.=20
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accust=
omed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way.=20
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and p=
otentially push Enron into bankruptcy.=20
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to re=
alize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into=
 off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its for=
mer chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
"There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who said=
 there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet t=
o come from Enron.=20

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession tra=
de on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal =
with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln =
usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said.=20
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up=
 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 poin=
ts at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98.=20
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dyneg=
y in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companie=
s are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fal=
l in Enron's share price of the past few weeks.=20
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that=
 would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their=
 record high last year of 87.50 usd.=20
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised.=20
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" claus=
e, which could be invoked to call the deal off.=20
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing =
with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly cont=
ained information it had not received previously.=20
"Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fadel=
 Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co.=20
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said=
, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have=
 continued to collapse.=20
"The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure,=
 it could be several billion dollars," said Gheit.=20
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new sto=
ck-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dyne=
gy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered.=20
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less t=
han 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would v=
alue Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.=20

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and s=
avior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement ha=
s done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing b=
ets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part t=
o stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surroundi=
ng the once mighty energy trader.=20
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised=
 down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take=
 more risks, looking to place trades on the deal.=20
"We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge =
fund.=20
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combi=
nation of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron'=
s shares with a long position in some of its bonds.=20
"People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against i=
t," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're st=
ill trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity=
 sides."=20
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them=
 later by purchasing them at a lower price.=20
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long =
positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical a=
bout Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and la=
rge banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.=20
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt =
market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," sai=
d a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron'=
s bonds.=20
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven=
 points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron=
 and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price=
=2E Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on t=
he dollar, up from 48 cents Monday.=20
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685=
 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to th=
e discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio i=
s expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enr=
on stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires st=
ory last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron a=
t less than $6 a share.=20
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for=
 hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds.=20
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than=
 $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose on=
ly $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio=
). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential b=
y going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by =
many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means=
 that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount.=20
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of=
 Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 8=
0 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stoc=
k is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conver=
sion ratio of 0.15.=20
"A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New Yo=
rk bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen mo=
re customers short the stock and buy the bonds."=20
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors ar=
e likely to wait for more news before taking a position.=20
"We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so=
 volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large New =
York hedge fund said.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks w=
ith a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enro=
n Corp. (ENE).=20
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the t=
ransaction related to the structure of the deal," said John Sousa. "I can't =
elaborate any further at this time."
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment.=20

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar =
with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cu=
t the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billio=
n. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report.=20
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shar=
es changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%.=20
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to recei=
ve 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about=
 $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price.=20
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dyne=

The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks=

ort its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, =
which totals about $13 billion.=20
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertai=
n how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent.=20
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 4=
01(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which =
has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron =
"locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell th=
e shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses.=20
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount =
of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a =
similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said.=20
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause tha=
t allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pending"=
' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked.=20
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits h=
ave been filed against Enron.=20

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising t=

The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving "the perc=

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done.

"I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle."

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

"Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache."

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "the
parties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of the
deal.

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands=

Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks=

deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate =
and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years=
=2E=20

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe=
 it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron share=
s down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 bil=
lion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago.=20

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, sever=
al top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron'=
s former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons."=20

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a s=
eries of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 mi=
llion; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreemen=
t that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enro=
n's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure t=
o follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executi=
ves, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exer=
cise of stock options in 2000 alone.=20

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival wit=
h 2000 revenue of $101 billion.=20

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis o=
f confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy=
 markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electr=
icity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company=
's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is =
that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that=
 it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills.=20

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that=
 number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their rat=
ings on Enron debt.=20

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/fina=
nce/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=3DCVX> - news <http://w=
ww.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=3DCVX> - people <http://www.=
forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=3D0&name=3D&ticker=3DCVX>), =
may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes th=
rough. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take=
 months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful tha=
t Enron can hang on by itself.=20

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and ser=
vices companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers e=
nergy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk manage=
ment services to customers around the world." While all this may be true, it=
s popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--m=
uch like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors.=20

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that re=
venue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Mos=
t of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold a=
s if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm.=20

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball sea=
son, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By =
2002, Enron Field may need a new name.=20

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it=
 means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterN=
orth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Ente=
ron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron=
 means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go with=
 Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of=
 revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.
