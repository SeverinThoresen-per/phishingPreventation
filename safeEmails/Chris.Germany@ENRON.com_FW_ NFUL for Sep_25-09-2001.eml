When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  T=
CO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.

Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal=
 for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes a=
lso do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is=
 (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).

TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for th=
e 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact=
