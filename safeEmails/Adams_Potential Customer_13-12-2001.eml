Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John =
Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,50=
0 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant tha=
t mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX. =20

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedg=
ing deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He i=
s concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him =
in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer =
Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the u=
pstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and=
 hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this p=
ossiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757
