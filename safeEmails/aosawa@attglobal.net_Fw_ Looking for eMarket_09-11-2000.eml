Dear Mr. kenneth L. Lay :
        Mr. Kenneth D. Rice :

I joined press conference on October 31 in Tokyo.

I would like to know more about Enron Online, because many Japanese
equipment, component and material manufacturers are interested in and know.

Now I am moving by business trip in the U.S.A. and I will go to Houston on
November 14 and 15. I would like to meet with business development,
marketing, or sales people in Enron Online. I appreciate if you or anybody
make an arrangement to meet.

I am lookingforward to your kind response.
