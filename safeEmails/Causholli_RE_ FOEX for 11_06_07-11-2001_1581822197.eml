Maybe I should rephrase it: What I was trying to say there was that producer=
s are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in November i=
n line with what they have announced. Whether that happens or not remains to=
 be seen.

thanks for the feedback though. It helps a lot.
Monika

Monika,

Good that you put some analysis with the price changes.  I'd be a bit carefu=
l about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through No=
vember --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe the=
re's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already =
received will begin to erode in the next few weeks.  I think it's important =
that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the h=
igh degree of uncertainty surrounding the market.  Thanks.

Karen

Hello,
 << File: Foex Prices.xls >>=20
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last wee=
k.=20

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP wa=
s US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with t=
he pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have=
 been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US=
$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still p=
rice increases are expected to continue in November.=20

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.  =20


Thanks,
Monika Causholli
