	talk to someone about the long-term implementation of this project.
	Thanks. Lynn

Looks like we are on track to resolve all outstanding requirements except th=
e prior month imbalance.  The data we need is not currently available by poi=
nt, only contract.  Perhaps a meeting with IT Accounting Support would be th=
e best next step.  Also, it would be nice to turn over the code we have to s=
omeone in IT for long-term implementation.  Lynn what are your thoughts?
