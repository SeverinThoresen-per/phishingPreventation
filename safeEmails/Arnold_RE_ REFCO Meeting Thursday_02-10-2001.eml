John

Joe Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures and Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd.=
 LLC will be here Thursday afternoon through dinner to further our discussio=
ns for providing a hosted marketplace where Enron would stream products with=
 wider bid/offer and smaller volume to their "retail" customer base. =20

The purpose of their visit is to firm up our discussion so that we can start=
 drafting a term sheet for the deal

I have carved out 1 hour this Thursday Oct 4 from 4:30 to 5:30pm in EB 27C2 =
to discuss the products that we currently make markets in and the volumes Re=
fco currently handles for their customers.

Would you or someone in your group be interested in attending?  Several of t=
he guys from the Oil & Refined products group will be there and I would like=
 to have at least a representative for gas that could speak for you.  I have=
 sent a note to Kevin Presto as well.

Regards

John Cummings=20
