Hello!  Would Wednesday from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. work out for you for the belo=
w-mentioned meeting?   That seems to be the general consensus from all of th=
e replies that I have received so far. =20
You had mentioned in your last e-mail that your assistant would contact us r=
egarding your calendar, but I don't believe that he/she has, and I looked on=
 Peoplefinder to find out who it was, but there was not one listed that I co=
uld tell.
Thanks, Stacy

Subject:	Diversity strategy meetings

As you may know, I recently moved into Cindy Olson's organization and am res=
ponsible for our corporate responsibility initiatives, including diversity. =
 Andrea Yowman now reports to me and will coordinate the diversity function.=
 =20

All of you are involved in diversity, whether it is because you have partici=
pated in the Corporate Culture Committee, are responsible for supplier diver=
sity, recruiting, compliance, etc.  We think that an ongoing coordination ef=
fort among the people invited will be critical to the success of our efforts=
=2E

I propose that we arrange a standing, one-hour meeting, initially every two =
weeks, to discuss overall strategy as well as individual activities that we =
have been involved in.  I would like for the first meeting to be held in mid=
-November.

I hope we can count on your participation.  Please let me know if you will b=
e able to participate, and if so, which day and time works best from the lis=
t below:

Tuesdays:		10:00 to 11:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.
Wednesdays:	9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.
Thursdays:		9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.
