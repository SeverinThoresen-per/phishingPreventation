Subject:	My Redeployment Experience


THIS MESSAGE IS PERSONAL  AND CONFIDENTIAL
=20
Mr. Lay:
    After attending the  All Employee Meeting at The Hyatt on Thursday, Augu=
st 16th during the Q&A  period, someone sent the comment stating "Redeployme=
nt is a  Joke". You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions or=
  concerns regarding this matter to shoot a e-mail to you, and you would  re=
spond .  After that statement regarding redeployment, I felt  compelled to d=
o just what you said-- send a message about my redeployment  experience.  I =
am doing this for two reasons: 1) to  prevent what has happened to me (from =
the HR representatives side of  redeployment) from happening to any other En=
ron employee whether redeployment or  any other experience with Enron's HR r=
eps and,  2) to let  you know the redeployment process at Enron is effective=
 and efficient  and two of  the MAIN values of Enron must be exalted higher.=
   Those values are Communication and  Respect.
=20
=20
    I received redeployment from  Enron Broadband Services- Investment group=
 on Monday, June 18th, 2001.   Sheila Walton, a HR rep spoke to me regarding=
 what the process would  entail.  During this meeting, Sheila mentioned the =
redeployment process to  me, but discussed and stressed to me more, my optio=
ns  when I departed the company, rather than my options to locate another  p=
osition with the company, not at all promoting the advantage of  redeploymen=
t and its many success stories.  With no directions from Sheila  Walton, I t=
ook it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment group  for a=
dvice and guidance.  I met Joyce through a info-luncheon hosted for  EBS ass=
istants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment and how  t=
he process works and it's successes.  Because of a lack of  Communication, t=
o the redeployment department, after a  week I did not have any information =
about me going into redeployment,  so at the end of the week, I had no locat=
ion for a redeployment desk and I  was leaving my department at the end of t=
he week of June 18-22.  =20
=20
    Due to this lack of  communication, I had to take off Monday & Tuesday J=
une 25th, 26th, to have  my desk churned and locate a space for me for 45 da=
ys.  Joyce Barrett  contacted me with a location and more information regard=
ing my redeployment  process.  Located in 3 Allen Center, I set-up my search=
 for  a "new" job at Enron, and my goal was to do my best to find a job  wit=
hin Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and  Enro=
n as a whole, by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions  and valu=
es.  I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume  and sharpen my=
 interview tactics.  Joyce  Barrett, Michele Hargrave and Brinella Knight we=
re in contact with me to find  out how my job search was going and lending s=
upport in any way.   I  had many interviews with companies outside and withi=
n Enron.  An  experience to meet new and interesting people and a opportunit=
y that I feel  I would have not been able to have without redeployment, so I=
  have no regrets about being redeployment.   I must tell you  that I was af=
raid, because a lot about this process, I was unsure of and my  HR rep did n=
othing to assure me or inform me that this transition  is one that can be re=
warding, as well as a strong  challenge.
=20
    With Enron's values  system, Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excel=
lence in place and  strongly promoted by you  and Jeff Skilling (before his =
 departure), I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side of =
 redeployment, has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes  and=
 I'm sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting  had e=
very meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a  way that "a joke" is=
 a kind way of putting it. No one should be  treated this way.   On July 31,=
 2001, I took a   temporary position in the Associate & Analyst Program head=
ed by Billy  Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis, John Walt and=
 Cathy Lira as  well as supporting the group as a whole.  I worked in this d=
epartment  until  August 21, 2001.  I received a message from Shirley Cox,  =
Sheila Walton's assistant inquiring whether or not I had a  position within =
Enron.  I called Shirley back and gave  her information about the temporary =
assignment I had taken in the Associate  & Analysts Program. On  August 14th=
, a call was made by Sheila  Walton to a Sr. Admin in the Associate & Analys=
t Program,  inquiring whether I was working this department.  The admin pass=
ed the  information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila Walton as to where=
 I was  working and how long I had been working in the department.  With a  =
remorseful sounding voice, Sheila proceeded to inquiry to Jeff more details,=
 to  which Jeff provided her.  I had overtime hours that I tried to put into=
 the  system, but I was unable to get into the time system.  After the  conv=
ersation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton, I  find  out Sheila  had started=
 the process to delete me from the system,  before my original end date of A=
ugust  15th.   I accepted a permanent position with Enron Networks as a Admi=
n  Assistant II on August 14, 2001 reporting to Sam Leuschen.  I started  th=
at position on August 22, 2001. On August 24, 2001, after 2 days  of employm=
ent was terminated from the position and Enron due to  Business Reorganizati=
on in Enron Networks. =20
=20
    I am very concerned about the  way this matter was handled and the serie=
s of events that surrounded this  action.  As a result,  I would like to dis=
cuss with you and or  someone in the responsible capacity and go into furthe=
r detail.   I have received a form letter stating that Enron can terminate m=
y employment at  will, at any time and for any reason.  I feel this action h=
as been provoked  for other reasons.=20
=20
     In ending this message to  you, Mr. Lay, you must know that redeploymen=
t at Enron is  a effective tool that should remain in place.  You should als=
o know and  commend those persons who work in and closely with the redeploym=
ent group.   Enough good things cannot not be said about those people who go=
  out of their way to get you the help, the encouragement, the tools you nee=
d  while facing this process.  I realize that a business  decision was made,=
 and EBS downfall was a business decision, but this matter is  not a busines=
s one.  When redeployment takes place, the human side of you  feel somewhat =
lost, hurt and you take it personally,although I realize it  was a business =
decision.  This occurrence was targeted and directed at  me personally by Sh=
eila Walton. Human resources should work with the human  being to make you a=
 better person through visions and values, not to be treated  inhumanely.  W=
hether they are Enron's values or values in  general, HR representatives sho=
uld portray what human  beings should have most of all...VALUES, and  when t=
here is no communication, no respect, no integrity, "the  joke" begins and e=
xcellence is lost..
=20
    I look forward to hearing from  you or someone in your office soon.   I =
can be contacted at the  numbers listed below at any time.   Thank you in ad=
vance for the  opportunity to discuss this matter.
