Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three=20
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system =
a=20
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still goo=
d=20
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work=20

Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors,=20
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will=20

possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it=20
including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF=20
down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the=20
facilities asap.

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on=
=20
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounde=
d=20
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What=20
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but =
I=20
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a=20
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut=
=20
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the=20
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and=
=20
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as=20
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie
