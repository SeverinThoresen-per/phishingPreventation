Great. If we have any inkling of a sale it should probably be mentioned at t=
his BOD meeting. We can call an executive committee when an actual approval =
is required but August can be real tough with vacations. Thanks for update. =

Discussions are progressing on the sale of Portland General.  I currently be=
lieve that it is unlikely that we will be in a position to seek approval at =
the August 14th board meeting, but it is possible.  We are working with all =
of the relevant groups (RAC, tax, accounting, etc.) just in case things brea=
k our way.  (Rick, Randy Petersen is working with us from RAC.)

I will keep you apprised as things develop, especially if thing accelerate i=
n the next few days.

I hope you are doing well,
Mark
