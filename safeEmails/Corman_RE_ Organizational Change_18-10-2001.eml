One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organi=
zed in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our client=
s in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is to m=
odify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" organiz=
ation that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial areas. =
 Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our resources=
 to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that C=
olleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediately.  Ri=
chard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Colleen's te=
am will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business generation=
" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operations group.  =
Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sale transacti=
ons and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead responsibility =
on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each of these lawye=
rs will also continue serving the numerous other clients they assisted befor=
e this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the r=
est of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way acq=
uisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Greg =
Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory activi=
ty on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Monday, a=
s Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, and will=
 coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot as he ge=
ts up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will continue it=
s role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus/FGT.  Do=
t's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group,=
 the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexible=
=2E  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with proj=
ects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the ch=
allenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in =
welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20
