Hi Carmen,=20

The mosquito spray you can get at Lowe's or Home Depo. It's one one those th=
at you just hook up to the end of your hose and turn the knob. I found it wo=
rks pretty well. Just take a couple days or so to work, It come in a gray ju=
g (it may be an Orhto product but don't bank on my memory). And yes, I am in=
to arts & crafts. I have a d/b/a Bungalow Life and hope to have an e-busines=
s one day and a  gallery studio and business out of my bungalow. I am a read=
er/student (and collector when I can afford it) of most anything from 1900-1=
920's. Hope to talk to you some time. I am at 906 Bomar.=20

Chris,

What is the spray that you hook up to your garden hose?
Non-toxic sounds good. Where do you buy it? Thanks!

Carmen Druke

P.S. Your e-mail address is bungalowlife, are you into arts
        and crafts houses?

I have an electric fogger, Amy, if youwould like to use it. However, i=20
must caution that it does use strong chemicals like the County fogger=20
trucks. I use it and keep my dog inside for an hour or so until the smell=20
dissapates. It has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust! hook=20
up to you hose and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is=20
non-toxic and works really well also.
Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.
