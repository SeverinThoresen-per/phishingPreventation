Lincoln Electric System (LES) would like us to set out in writing what a del=
ivery point operator is.  LES is constructing and owning a new TBS (LES TBS =
#1) to their new power plant near Lincoln.  Apparently, having a letter sett=
ing this out is very important to them.  Dari has developed the attached let=
ter and wanted to run it by you all for your approval.  Please let me know a=
s soon as possible if you have any issues with the letter.  Thanks!
