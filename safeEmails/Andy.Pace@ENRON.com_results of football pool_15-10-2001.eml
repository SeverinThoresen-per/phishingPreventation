Hello everyone,=20

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into do=
uble digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/S=
tanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Te=
ch game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas g=
ame won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Aubu=
rn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as wel=
l.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Gr=
een Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, =
however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the P=
atriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle g=
ames were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly =
missed as well.=20

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St,=
 Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead curren=
tly with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games w=
ith Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan=
 and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washing=
ton wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total p=
oints, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer=
 pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve wi=
ll win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Wa=
shington and 37 or more total points scored.=20

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given a=
s always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 =
people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68.=20

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night becaus=
e of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week a=
nd next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afte=
rnoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the n=
umber missed by each person after their name.=20
