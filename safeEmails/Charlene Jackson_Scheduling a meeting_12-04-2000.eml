Sally,

Dolores Muzzy, Celeste Roberts' assistant was attempting to schedule a=20
meeting to discuss the Commercial Services program.  The reason that Dolores=
=20
is trying to schedule a meeting is follows:
(1)  Celeste and I were scheduled to speak briefly at Rick's staff meeting o=
n=20
Tuesday, April 11th as we had at Cliff Baxter's on March 27th.  However, we=20
were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the=20
discussion may have been extensive, Rick agreed that it made more sense to=20
schedule a meeting in which the Commercial Services program was the sole=20
topic of discussion.

(2) You and I had exchanged voice mails on March 27th, immediately after=20
Cliff's staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individual=
s=20
who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding=
=20
questions about the management of the program.  You indicated that you would=
=20
facilitate scheduling the meeting.  However, given that I had not heard from=
=20
you and Celeste had told Rick we would schedule a meeting, it seemed to make=
=20
sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of=
=20
the same individuals and cover the same questions.

I have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you=
=20
expressed to Dolores.  However, given that we told Rick that we would=20
schedule a meeting, we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip=20
through the cracks.  We will attempt to be available whenever it is=20
convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together.  If you wis=
h=20
to schedule a meeting immediately, our availability is as follows:

Friday, April 14th from 2:00 - 5:00 p.m.
Monday, April 17th from 9:30 - 11:30 a.m.
Tuesday, April 18th from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. or 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.
Wednesday, April 19th from 9:00 - 11:30 a.m.

If these dates don't work please don't hesitate to suggest others.   We look=
=20
forward to meeting with you.

Thanks

Charlene

P.S. My schedule gets pretty crazy so if you could let me know as soon as=20
possible what date works for you I can be sure to hold the time.  Thanks.
