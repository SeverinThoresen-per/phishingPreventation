Do you remember Jim Paul from Carr?  He kept calling me about setting up a m=
argin line for you to trade on and eventually we decided that it was not a g=
ood idea for Enron.  He visited me in Houston with a large team of people on=
 the subject.  I called Credit Agricole (owner of Carr) in Houston and sadly=
 it is feared that he did not make it out from the World Trade Center. =20
