Hunter, I spoke with Heather Purcell who is kind of like the intermediate be=
tween IT and business in terms of web based commodity information. Basically=
 I informed her that CF was now being released to the gas trader/originators=
 and showed her the message board features for each commodity (have a look o=
n the site .. very cool).=20

Anyway, when I proposed to her that it would be in her interest to encourage=
 her users to use CF, and that it will not allow a single point of reference=
 for weather information etc. I experienced immediate resistance. Heather ba=
sically informed me that her boss, Shankman would not be using the site beca=
use it did not contain the power information!! My response was why not use t=
he site at least to facilitate the communication between crude + gas in the =
mean-time, basically integral markets.

=2E.. anyway, I think the basic problem is that Heather et al  have spent a =
great deal of time + money on the design of all 10 or so EGM sites (prob ove=
r 100k), and now her is one site that does it all and more !!!=20

I know you realize the issues, but for this to be a completely effect tool f=
or the traders, we really need buy in from EGM. I appreciate Heather's resis=
tance, however you can't stop progress.

What do you think ??

-Colin
