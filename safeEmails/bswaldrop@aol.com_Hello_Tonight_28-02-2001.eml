Where is my "heartfelt and meaningful" e-mail?  I have been waiting all day!

So, what time are you planning on leaving work?  I am leaving here at 5:30
and heading over to Steve and Gina's to change and walk their dog.  I have
already taken Sophie over there.  That way I don't have to go home and then
come back all the way over here.  Do you want to come over to Steve and
Gina's or do you want me to come by and pick you up?

Hope you are having a good day.  Talk with you soon!
