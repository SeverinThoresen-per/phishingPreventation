Group,

In addition to Virginia's suggestions below, please copy me when responding=20
to Virginia's DMS emails. =20

Also as you can tell, Virginia is growing frustrated with what she perceives=
=20
as a lack of documentation (particularily from cuts).  I know that complex=20
cuts are very difficult and can be extremely time consuming but try to take=20
the extra five minutes to provide accurate documentation.  Doing so will=20
undoubtedly save time going forward. Please let me know if you have any=20
questions concerning our cuts procedures or if you have feedback for=20
improving our cut and dispute management systems.

Thank you for your help.

Bill

Dear Traders,

Here are a couple of things I've thought of that will make it easier for me=20
to research deals when there is a dispute.  Please discuss whatever necessar=
y=20
with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research.=20

1.) All notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them.  Notebooks=20
with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders'=
=20
interpretation.

2.) Can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times?  I ofte=
n=20
find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason. =20

3.) One thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the Inc sheets,=20
however, I still sometimes find that the trader's notes and the Inc sheets o=
r=20
the El Paso Model don't match.  At that point, I don't know which one to go=20
by.  I need to be sure that I can trust the accuracy of the Inc sheets as th=
e=20
end-all.

4.) Please make sure that all real-time deals or real-time extended deals ar=
e=20
getting routed.  I've come across a number of deals that are not routed and=20
this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate.  It also makes=
=20
it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes.

5.) Please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled.  I've seen a=
=20
few deals that are in the traders' notebooks, but that haven't been entered=20
in EnPower.  You know the result.

6.) CUTS (need I say more) ...are a mess.  I really really need to see notes=
=20
on every cut!!!!!  This means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes=20
database AND notes in deal scheduling !=20
When a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut, I need t=
o=20
see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note.  Many of my DMS's could=20
have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in EnPower (this means I=20
found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to recor=
d=20
this in EnPower).  I specifically need to see the following for every cut=20
schedule:  Where did resupply come from (deal # too)?  Was it a bookout (dea=
l=20
# too)?  What's the resupply price?  Who at the counterparty did our trader=20
talk to?  What is the reason for the cut?  And please initial your notes so=20
that if I have a question about them, I know who to ask.
You can never make too many notes!!

One thing to remember is that Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, and Lotus Notes d=
o=20
not communicate with each other, so though it is a grueling task, every=20
transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places.  (it's=20
called copy and paste)

If we can keep these things in mind, I think we will have fewer disputes in=20
the future.  And when we do have disputes, I'll be able to figure them out i=
n=20
a more timely manner. =20

Thanks for your attention to these things.  I look forward to bugging you=20
less in the future.

Virginia
