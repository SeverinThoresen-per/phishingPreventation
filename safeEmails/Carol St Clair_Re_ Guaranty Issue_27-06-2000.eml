We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty wher=
e=20
we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that=
=20
basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of th=
e=20
rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to=20
only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it=20
were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted=20
your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
