According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show=20
below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal:=20
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zon=
e=20
SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even afte=
r=20
paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the=20
prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zon=
e=20
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02=20
(including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with=20
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this=
=20
is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid=20
price  and the transport expense?
