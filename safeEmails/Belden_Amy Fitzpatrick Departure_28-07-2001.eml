We regret to announce that Amy Fitzpatrick will be leaving Enron's Portland =
office in September.  Amy's husband, Simon, has accepted a job in New Jersey=
, and it didn't make sense for them to "commute" coast to coast.  Amy will c=
ontinue to work here for the next month or two to hire her replacement and t=
o make sure that her responsibilities have been completely handed over.  We =
really appreciate having such long lead time to effectuate this transition.

Amy has made tremendous contributions to our office over the last 14 months.=
  We really appreciate her efforts.  We realize that Amy has become integral=
 to the efficient operation of the Portland office and want to make her tran=
sition as smooth as possible.  If you have any concerns or wish to get any i=
ssues on to the "transition list" please let your manager and/or Amy know.

Tim Belden and Chris Calger
