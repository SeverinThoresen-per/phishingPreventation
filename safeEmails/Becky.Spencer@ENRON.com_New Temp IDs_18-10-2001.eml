Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new tempo=
rary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access righ=
ts for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing=
 this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are lis=
ted.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights=
 work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-=
mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, t=
he access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outl=
ook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to a=
ll the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how mu=
ch access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give=
 full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or acce=
ss only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your fo=
lders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" bu=
tton.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you=
 just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding t=
he Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not sel=
ect anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, =
right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed=
 only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in =
handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.=20
