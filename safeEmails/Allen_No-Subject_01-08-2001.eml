John,

I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I ha=
ve been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driv=
ing this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.

I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the we=
ather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nat=
ure of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.

See you on Monday.

Phillip
