Hello, sistas-

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has
cookin' that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest
