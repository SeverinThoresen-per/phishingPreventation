The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry=20
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state=
,=20
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.=20
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants=20
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20
information not available to the public.
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had bee=
n=20
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions an=
d=20
their personal finances.=20
As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis official=
s=20
were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration own=
s=20
energy stocks.=20
Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company=20
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California ha=
s=20
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20
Enron Corp. in 1996.=20
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.=20
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.=20
Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's=20
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the=
=20
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction=
=20
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a=20
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.=20
"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he=20
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available=20
information.=20
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms=20
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy=20
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.=20
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.=20
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held=20
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of=20
multimillion-dollar price gouging.=20
In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after=
=20
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were=20
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20
failed to do so.=20
In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.=20
"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said=20
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.=20
Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and=20
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20
crisis.=20
In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure=
=20
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two=20
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20
possibility of insider trading.=20
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving thei=
r=20
personal financial interests.=20
The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,=20
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not=20
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the=20
agency's review would result in any charges.=20
Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by=20
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider=20
trading.=20
But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his=20
colleagues owned Calpine stock.=20
Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended=
=20
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.=20
Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying powe=
r=20
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders=20
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to b=
e=20
filed only two weeks ago.=20
"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,=20
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."=20
Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two=20
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before=
=20
leaving her state job.=20
Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in=
=20
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stoc=
k=20
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a=20
good investment.=20
"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.=20
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."=20
As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20
state, but only at market prices.=20
Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his=
=20
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,=20
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court=20
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.=20
Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said=20
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for=20
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.=20
"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.=20
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor,=
=20
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20
consulting business with the governor."=20
As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20
Monday morning.=20
Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathlee=

Already on the defensive over its energy advisers' financial holdings, Gov.=20
Gray Davis' administration came under fresh attack yesterday when his chief=20
spokesman admitted buying $12,000 worth of Calpine Corp. stock last month.=20
Steve Maviglio, Davis' acting director of communications, denied that his=20
purchase of the San Jose energy company's stock constituted a conflict of=20
interest. He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyers=
=20
asked him to.
"I invested in a growing California company," Maviglio said. "It's sad when=20
somebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest."=20
The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davis=20
brought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the public=20
agreed not to take any money for the work they have done. Davis was=20
criticized for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked as=20
consultants for Southern California Edison.=20
On Friday, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible conflict-=20
of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market purchases=
=20
or long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, and=20
the fifth held Enron shares.=20
ON THE DEFENSIVE=20
Maviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensive=20
himself yesterday.=20
He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in it=20
when shares hit a certain price, he said. He said that showed he had made hi=
s=20
decision independently of whatever action he might have taken in the=20
governor's office on any particular day.=20
Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month. As of yesterday, the 300=
=20
shares that Maviglio bought for $12,000 were worth about $11,100.=20
Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energy=20
companies. He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and has=20
disclosed on all forms, he added.=20
"I've called them pirates and gougers and lumped them in with all the rest o=
f=20
the generators," Maviglio said.=20
Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP opponent of Davis for=20
governor in 2002, said Maviglio should be fired.=20
"These actions are unethical and unacceptable," said Jones, who called on th=
e=20
governor's staff to release updated conflict-of- interest statements. "He ha=
d=20
the power to promote Calpine through press releases. That seems to me to be =
a=20
clear conflict of interest."=20
Calpine sold the state $14 million worth of power earlier this year and has =
a=20
large share of the $43 billion in long-term contracts for electricity that=20
the state has entered into.=20
Earlier this month, when he threw the ceremonial switch on a new Calpine=20
plant in Pittsburg, Davis singled out the company as being more cooperative=20
with California than out-of-state suppliers that the governor has=20
characterized as gougers.=20
IMAGE-POLISHING=20
The Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversy=20
behind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor to=20
burnish his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for the=
=20
state.=20
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave th=
e=20
Davis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed on=20
behalf of a national taxpayer rights group.=20
Lehane and Fabiani -- nicknamed the "Masters of Disaster" for their work in=20
getting former President Bill Clinton out of political jams -- started in th=
e=20
governor's office in May and were originally supposed to be paid $30,000 a=20
month.=20
It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for Southern=20
California Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoid=20
bankruptcy. State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two=
=2E=20
"It really raises the question in my mind, what is it about=20
conflict-of-interest and other ethical rules that the governor's office=20
doesn't understand?" said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax=20
Limitation Committee, which filed the lawsuit.=20
In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant becaus=
e=20
his work had been "successfully implemented." Lehane, on the other hand,=20
dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis.=20
Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at=20
$150 an hour. His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 2=
6=20
to Nov. 20, 2001.=20
'OUTRAGEOUS EXPENSE'=20
"This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers," Uhler said. "I believe there=20
was a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws."=20
The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the lawsuit=
,=20
Maviglio said. The two could not be reached for comment.=20
"It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public service=20
because of a lawsuit," Maviglio said.=20
Jones, who filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission=20
concerning the two consultants, said, "I think it's clear from recent action=
s=20
by the governor's office that there have been rampant violations of the=20
state's conflict-of-interest laws. Their attempts to mitigate the damage fro=
m=20
these violations is too little, too late."=20
Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hired=20

India's Power Boards Lose $5 Bln as Subsidies Rise, Paper Says
2001-07-31 01:53 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 31 (Bloomberg) -- India's state
electricity boards that distribute power lost 260 billion
rupees ($5.5 billion) in the year ended March because of rising
subsidies and electricity thefts, the Business Standard
reported, citing government figures.
     Power subsidies, mainly to farmers, rose 12 percent to
370.37 billion rupees last year and made up for half the
average tariff of 2.12 rupees a kilowatt-hour. Subsidies have
risen 83 percent since 1997.
     Power costs have risen 41 percent the past three years to
3.03 rupees a kilowatt-hour though the growth in tariffs has
been lower at 28 percent, leading to losses, the paper said.
     Forced to sell subsidized power to farmers and hurt by
power thefts, electricity boards are unable to pay power
generators. Two U.S. power producers, Enron Corp. and AES
Corp., have asked the government to buy out their stakes in
local power projects because of unpaid bills.



India To Evaluate Options On Enron Stake Buy Out Offer

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The federal government has told financial=20
institutions to pump in more money or find a new investor to save the Dabhol=
=20
power project, now that U.S.-based Enron Corp. has said it wants out, The=20
Financial Express reported Tuesday.=20
The Industrial Development Bank of India, and other institutions, have been=20
told to work out a package to complete the dlrs 2.9 billion project in=20
western Maharashtra state, the paper said, quoting unidentified officials of=
=20
the banks and the Power Ministry.
Power Ministry officials were quoted as saying that Enron had agreed in=20
principle to finish the project if the dlrs 230 million can be found, and=20
then Enron could sell its majority stake.=20
The project was billed as the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant,=
=20
able to generate 2,184 megawatts once completed at Dabhol, 335 kilometers=20
(210 miles) south of Bombay. The second phase, to be run on liquefied natura=
l=20
gas, was to be commissioned by the end of the year.=20
Enron, based in Houston, Texas has invested dlrs 875 million in the project =
-=20
India's biggest foreign investment. Enron said July 28 it wants the Indian=20
government and lenders to buy out its 65 per cent stake.=20
The plant stopped production in May after its only customer, the Maharashtra=
=20
State Electricity Board, said it was canceling a seven-year-old power=20
purchase agreement. The state also stopped buying power from Enron's=20
two-year-old naphtha plant.=20
The state says Enron's prices are too high and has demanded the contract be=20
renegotiated.=20
The Financial Express said that lenders are ready to pump another dlrs 320=20
million into Dabhol, but there is a shortfall of an additional dlrs 230=20
million.=20
The financial institutions will have to find a new investor or provide the=20
money themselves, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying.=20
It also quoted Power Ministry officials as saying it would be difficult to=20
find a buyer until the project is completed. Some of the needed money may be=
=20
sought from Maharashtra state, which had committed to making payments, the=20
paper quoted Power Ministry officials as saying.=20
The current charges for power are still a matter of contention, however.=20
The paper said Enron had reduced its price demands, after the government=20
offered various tax and customs duty concessions, but the government wants=20

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock
2001-07-30 21:36 (New York)

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock

     Sacramento, California, July 30 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman
for California Governor Gray Davis said bought $12,000 worth of
stock in energy producer Calpine Corp. in June as the state was
working with the company to open new power plants and buying
millions of dollars a day in electricity.
     Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio purchased 300 shares of
Calpine on June 20 after putting in an order on May 31 to buy the
stock when it fell to $40, he said. The purchase is being reviewed
by the Governor's legal office, Maviglio said.
     ``These purchases were based on no knowledge of anything,
just public information about a growing California company,''
Maviglio said. ``I've informed the governor, the chief of staff
and our legal counsel today. I'd be glad to divest myself if
that's what required.''
     Maviglio also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in
Enron Corp. shares, which he said he purchased in 1996. His
purchases came to light three days after California officials said
they fired five consultants hired to advise California on energy
after they disclosed that they owned shares of Calpine.
     The consultants worked for the Department of Water Resources,
which at the time was buying millions in electricity from Calpine
and other energy generators. California has spent almost $8
billion buying electricity for its two largest utilities, which
have been insolvent since January.
     Nine energy consultants were ordered by Davis's lawyer Barry
Goode last week to sell any energy-company stock they owned,
including shares of Enron Corp., Calpine Corp., and Dynegy Inc.,
after Secretary of State Bill Jones pressured Davis to release
details of their holdings.
     Jones said today in a statement that Maviglio should be fired
for the purchases.
     ``These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable
and heads should role,'' Jones said. ``Mr. Maviglio should be
fired immediately.''
     Jones has publicly called on Davis to force the 50
consultants hired by the state to disclose their holdings in
energy companies. Last week he urged the Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate whether any of the consultants or
advisers traded stock based on non-public information.
     Maviglio said no one in the administration or at the
Department of Water Resources had been contacted by the SEC. ``No
one's been contacted either here or at DWR,'' Maviglio said.
     A spokeswoman for the SEC in San Francisco, Helane Morrison,
said the agency would not confirm or deny an investigation.
     Calpine shares are down 6.8 percent since June 20, when
Maviglio says he purchased the shares.
