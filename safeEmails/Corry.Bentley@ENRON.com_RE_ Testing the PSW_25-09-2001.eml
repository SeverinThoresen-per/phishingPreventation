I ran the PSW for the East (6/22 data)  and also had problems with each of t=
he following:
1)	Enter moves cell to the left
2) 	Colors changed
3)	Path with transmission did not go to confirmation sheet
4) 	Physicals were noted on the confirmation strips, but not on scheduling s=
trips
5)	Confirmation strips were deleted, and new data added to the PSW.  Then, t=
he confirmation button would not respond again.
6)	The first query for buildroute did not work.  Second query worked ok, dat=
a could be viewed.

What did work:

Only East power showing up!

I'll be testing again today, and D. Baugham will be looking at the PSC this =
week.

Thanks,
Corry

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in=
 the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the ce=
ll to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right=
=2E  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it=
 did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.

Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did =
that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and diffi=
cult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as=
 dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no patter=
n to why some cells are grey and some aren't.

The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting t=
o the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still=
 shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling,=
 although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed =
deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.

Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Pos=
ton regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.

The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily =
Excel Summary.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the rout=
ing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes bef=
ore going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of=
 parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  =
I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara
