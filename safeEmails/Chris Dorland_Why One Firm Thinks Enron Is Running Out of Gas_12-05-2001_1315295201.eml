   Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis   Senior C=
olumnist Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com            =
A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling=
 clients to quickly dump Enron (ENE :NYSE - news ), believing that the energ=
y trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's foreca=
sts.  Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, t=
hinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimat=
e of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, near=
ly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, published May 6=
, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing leverage and sug=
gests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a tradin=
g firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 price-to-earn=
ings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges that Enron's ear=
nings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are con=
fusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time o=
n elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An energy analyst who=
 is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misu=
nderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he say=
s the report does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The anal=
yst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economies of Scale Why care=
 what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrill Lynch =
(MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent track record. Particularl=
y sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down. It =
has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve, recommending that clien=
ts sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news ) in June 1999, when fai=
th in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their most ins=
ane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long rally   Enron, with its dom=
ination of a burgeoning energy market, annual revenue of over $100 billion a=
nd impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked alongside the likes of p=
riceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a precipitous drop nonetheless. Wh=
y?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margi=
ns on Enron's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releas=
es call IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are falling.=
 Total IBIT of $795 million in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of t=
he $50 billion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in th=
e fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first =
quarter was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose on=
ly 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an in=
creasingly large share of Enron's revenue base.  OWS thus calculates that fo=
r the remainder of 2001 Enron needs to generate an extra $2.1 billion in rev=
enue for each additional penny it makes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach =
analysts' expectation of $1.79.  The energy analyst counters that OWS appare=
ntly hasn't grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when ma=
rgins shrink. It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market b=
alloons in size. In other words, margins may decline, but since revenues are=
 so much higher, earnings still go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001=
 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT =
margin shrank by 3.2 percentage points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $=
1.82 per share in 2001.  Growing On You In addition, the huge growth in the =
energy market that has so helped Enron is likely to continue for several yea=
rs, according to the analyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity a=
vailable in the U.S. still isn't traded in a market. "Eventually it will be =
part of a competitive environment, but it'll take five to 10 years," says th=
e analyst. And he believes the extreme volatility in energy-related commodit=
ies that has also benefited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  =
Still, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. R=
eturn on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% i=
n 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Du=
ke (DUK :NYSE - news ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even =
Goldman (8.9%).  Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to=
 follow. For example, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesal=
e services, or trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one=
 area of the company's financial statements registered with the Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that desc=
ribes Enron's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with e=
ntities that have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related=
 entities that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow=
=2E The energy analyst comments: "Why are they doing this? It's just inappro=
priate."  The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deal=
s has been a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of op=
tical fiber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the s=
econd quarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (opti=
cal cable without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron t=
o beat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rathe=
r than missing by 2 cents.  How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Str=
eet on Enron?   =09
