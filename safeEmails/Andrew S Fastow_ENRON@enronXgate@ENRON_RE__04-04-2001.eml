Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specificall=
y, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks a=
t PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value si=
nce we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this "loss"=
 of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, sho=
uld be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only tha=
t each of these investments are "positions" that should be "owned" by someon=
e, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't s=
how up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Ga=
rland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset f=
or a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon dispositio=
n, how do you evaluate the performance?

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the rapt=
or assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of inte=
grity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree=
