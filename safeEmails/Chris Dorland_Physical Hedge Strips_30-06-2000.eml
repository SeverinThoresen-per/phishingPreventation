Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the=20
risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long=20
or short. My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile. W=
e=20
need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie=20
out. If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it.=20
Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.

Thanx,

Chris
