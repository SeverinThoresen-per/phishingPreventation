Subject: PG&E Questions


PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?
