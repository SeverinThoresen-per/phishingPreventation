I wanted to take a minute to commend all of you on a job well done in succes=
sfully integrating WebModal and implementing the operational processes for F=
reight Markets in a very short period of time.  I have been involved in seve=
ral acquisitions over the years here at Enron and I have never seen one that=
 went as well as WebModal from an operational standpoint.  Everyone came tog=
ether as a team and ensured that integration timelines were met and that the=
 business was allowed to continue its daily operations with minimal problems=
 internally or to our external counterparties.

Again, congratulations on a great job.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

Brent
