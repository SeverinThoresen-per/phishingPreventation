Chris:
Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward=20
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with=20
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sur=
e=20
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity t=
o=20
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
