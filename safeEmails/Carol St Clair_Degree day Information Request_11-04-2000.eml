Carol,

Some of the data sets we receive on a regular basis from the National Weathe=
r=20
Service are not 100% complete.  i.e., a day or two of data may be missing=20
from the data set.  In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures,=20
rainfall, and/or snowfall) may be missing.  For our internal purposes, our=20
research group uses analytical tools to determine a "best guess" at what the=
=20
actual data was.  We replace the blanks in our files with our best guesses. =
=20
We usually highlight derived data in our files, but we cannot be sure that w=
e=20
have highlighted derived data in every case.

A customer is requesting some historical data from us.  We would like to sen=
d=20
this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of=20
misrepresenting our analysis as fact.  What do we need to do to absolve=20
ourselves of any liability in this regard?

Please call with any questions.

Regards,

Gary Taylor

Lucy,

I work with Bill Gautreaux at Inergy Services.  I am working on several
proposals in which historical degree day averages are needed.  Would you
be able to provide the 10 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and 30 degree day averages
(ending with calendar 1999) for the following locations.

Raliegh, NC
Chattanooga, TN
Fort Wayne, IN
Chicago, IL
Detroit, MI

You have recently provided us with some of the information above, but I
am missing several components.

I can be reached at 816-741-5080 if you have any questions.

I appreciate your help in providing the information.

Carl Hughes
