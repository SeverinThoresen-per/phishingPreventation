Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I=20
remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path=20
those deals and email Mark when you are done.

Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unif=
y=20
after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed=20
interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000.
