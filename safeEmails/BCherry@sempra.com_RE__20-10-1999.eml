Enron's protest of the AL, despite its limited nature, held up the approval
as would be expected.  It also got the attention of those at the Commission
who want a piece of everything, as you should have also expected.  As a
result, we were told that the only way to sell it was to file an 851
explaining what we had already explained in the AL., because that is what
the bureaucracy demands.  As I spoke with you earlier about, the protest
would be the death knell.  Although we have transferred the site to a third
party under license, we now have to wait for the Commission to bless it.
Enron knows how state Commission's work as evidenced by it purchase and now
future sale of PGE.  The problem is, your intervention hasn't done much for
the spirit of cooperation internally......

marketplace advice letter.  yet you've filed something new saying you will
file
