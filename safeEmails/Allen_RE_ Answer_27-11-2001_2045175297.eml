David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mea=
n Section 6.3. =20

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpre=
tation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding an=
y other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains th=
e complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your tran=
slation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a s=
ingle amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John =
L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears =
to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally=
 the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of =
adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is th=
e methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a conv=
enient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip =20

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum dis=
tribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at on=
ce, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected b=
y a participant in his or her deferral agreement. =20

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of t=
he last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives =
the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected =
in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restr=
icted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the =
Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution=
 of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indic=
ates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units=
 are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the =
payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.=
 =20

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and w=
e do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.
