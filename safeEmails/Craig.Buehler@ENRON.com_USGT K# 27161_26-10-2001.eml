	Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.  USGT requested a realignment o=
f delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).  They h=
eld onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returned the=
 amendment.  Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry Frazie=
r but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this amendmen=
t to them.  The changes have been activated in the TW contract system; howev=
er, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nominated th=
ese changes.  Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and would "proba=
bly" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was suggested b=
y Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.  As you're aware, Miche=
lle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was tendered pri=
or to our re-implemention of the routing process.  I'll get you the file and=
 associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examination. Our Tari=
ff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 days, is null an=
d void.  Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we could just say i=
t "timed out"...  just a thought.
