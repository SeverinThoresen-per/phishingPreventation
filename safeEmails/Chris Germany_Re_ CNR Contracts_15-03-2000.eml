The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with=20
Chris Germany yesterday and to our knowledge these gathering contracts have=20
never been set up in our systems. =20

I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwei=

down on 30.  Actually, I think it would be a great idea to spend a few=20
minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too fa=
r=20
into the process and we discover that rework is being done.
