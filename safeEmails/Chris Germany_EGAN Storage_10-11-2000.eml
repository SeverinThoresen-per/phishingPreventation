I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec.  =
I=20
think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Ga=
s=20
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I=
=20
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR=20
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone=20
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.
