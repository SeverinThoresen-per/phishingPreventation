As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract=20
I00059 that will be "Park and Lend".

I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were=
=20
necessary:

 1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty "CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE" (when=20
done with the pipeline) and
 2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) a=
s=20
the counterparty.  This is where you
  will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service=
=20
that Molly can path on so as to
  get the correct rate for the service.

I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set=20
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.
