	We rely on the information from the Process Responsibility meeting to post=20
	weekend coverage to the WEB.  The coverage is posted by Tuesday morning
	on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers.

	Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting.
	You should have the right information going into Monday's meeting.

	It does not look good to continually repost this information.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.

	Thanks. Lynn
