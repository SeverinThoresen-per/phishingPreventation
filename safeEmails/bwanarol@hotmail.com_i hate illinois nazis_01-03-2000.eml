hallo y'all.   it would seem from the feedback i have received from doug and
john that easter weekend would be far preferable to the 29th or the first
weekend in may.



well y'all i cannot commit just yet, so once again i will convey the
following:  if you absolutely cannot get to the pedernales on the two
lattermost aforementioned weekends, speak now or forever hold your peace.



will let y'all know asap.  but this here communication thing is mutual
endeavor and i would like to hear from everyone just to be sure.



rol
