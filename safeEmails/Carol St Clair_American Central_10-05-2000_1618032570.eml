Here is what their letter should say to us:

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998=20
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of=20
Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April=
=20
6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations=20
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such=
=20
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty=
=20
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend th=
e=20
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,00=
0=20
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Sectio=
n=20
6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date=
=20
being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b=
)=20
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as=
=20
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing writte=
n=20
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such=20
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as=20
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by=20
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of suc=
h=20
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the=20
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect=
=20
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the=20
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the=20
terms of this Guaranty."
