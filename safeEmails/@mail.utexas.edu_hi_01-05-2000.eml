Hi Sweetie,

How are you?  Are you working hard?  Hopefully, this email has my name
on it!  I haven't received an email from Jeff yet, but I hope he can
help me out.

I had a terrible night's sleep last night.  All I could think about is
how much I have to do and how little money I have.  I kept dreaming
about not getting things done fast enough.  It rained all night too.
The  thunder was so loud that it woke me up when I finally fell asleep.

Anyway, I'm gonna be ecstatic when this week is over!!!  It's going to
be so nice to relax with you.  All I have is one final to study
for...yeah, it's worth 30% but it's only one final!

If I have a chance I'll email you again later (esp. since I can't call
you this week).

5 more days of class.......

Love you,
Jenn
