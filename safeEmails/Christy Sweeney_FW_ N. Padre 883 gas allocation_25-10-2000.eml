Christy, I think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you, or your office.

I would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the N. Padre production.  I am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter.  Spinnaker expects a Division Order Title Opining within a few
weeks.  I also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final Opinion.  In talking with Ranger and The Houston
Exploration Company, they are prepared to receive their gross (shown below)
and be responsible to their respective ORRI owners.

How do you recommend we proceed?  Will HPL pay taxes on behalf of the
parties?

When you get a minute, please call me at 713/759-1770.

Thanks,

Dan McCue
