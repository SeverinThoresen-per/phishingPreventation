Subject:	Exchange Specialist Proposal

John,

I'm trying to put together the proposal for the exchange.  Who should I work=
 with to nail down the Specialist structure.  We can handle the technical st=
ructure.  Attached is the draft proposal that I put together to begin develo=
ping a term sheet.  The Specialist requirements and incentives were my initi=
al thoughts.
