Gentleman:
        The ERMS system, as you know, has an excellent capability for=20
decomposing option P&L into the following components:

new deals
curve shift
gamma
vega
theta
rho
drift
2nd order adjustments

What i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars. =
=20
The unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position=
=20
is being associated with specific prices.  These prices are the effective bu=
y=20
or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position. =20

Stated differently, the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price=20
variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma's=20
standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs.  This is something I dont=20
understand.  To date, inquiries to the risk management accounting group has=20
further revealed that the gamma component of P&L is not well understood. =20

This is what concerns me: Bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures (NYME=
X=20
and Gas Daily).  Both books dynamically hedged its positions during=20
yesterdays large price move and, through anticipitory hedging in advance or=20
during the large price move, secured sufficient coverage to neutralize=20
expected changes in delta.  However, our P&L from our underlying position di=
d=20
not offset our gamma P&L.  Consequently, I have to ask WHY?  Im hoping that =
a=20
brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something whic=
h=20
will better guide our hedging decisions.

Any help is appreciated
