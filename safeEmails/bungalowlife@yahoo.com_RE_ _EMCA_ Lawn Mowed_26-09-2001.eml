^<P> Laura,
<P>Talk to Carl (next door to you) or &nbsp;Manny( next door to Carl) or
Kay (next door to Manny). They all use the same guy - Alex Chavez. Renee
has his phone number for sure and I'll look for it at my house when I get
home. He's reasonable ($25.00)&nbsp;and comes very two weeks or so. He
does CArl, Kay, Manny, Renee and Eric (live across from&nbsp; me) and
Larry (also across street from me). I have used him too and can recommend
him. I just happen to enjoy doing my own yard.
<P>Chris
