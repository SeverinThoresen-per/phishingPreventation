Suzanne:
Just checking in with you.  I'm really looking forward to next weekend and I=
=20
really appreciate you volunteering to bring dessert!  That was really "sweet=
"=20
of you!  How are things?  Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not,=20
I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at=20
our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the=20
opportunity to get out of the house and play with the "girls" which is alot=20
of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, bu=
t=20
between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I=20
could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really=20
miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in=
=20
a few months.

Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't=20
wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos,=20
don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood. =20
The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around=20
that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the=20
day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during=20
the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.

Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that=20
something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?  Some=
=20
of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it,=20
taht would be great.

Well I've got to go.  Take care.
