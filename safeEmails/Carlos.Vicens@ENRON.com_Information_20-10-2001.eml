Kenneth,

I'm an associate in EES, and I have been working in Enron for two an a half =
years.

First I would like apologies if this causes any inconveniences, but I am wri=
ting this email to you because I'm quite concern about the latest news about=
 the partnership/CFO  that came out in the last week or so. Me and many of m=
y fellow A/A co-workers as well as other employees do not know what is going=
 on, and speaking for myself, if it's possible for you to let me and everyon=
e else know what the situation is and how are you taking measures to reassur=
e confidence in the marketplace I would greatly appreciate your time.

I assure you that many of my fellow A/A co-workers have confidence in the fu=
ture of Enron, and I expect that greener pastures will be in front of us ver=
y soon.

Many thanks in advance,
Carlos Vicens
