GEORGE, Wash. -- Doing something nice for California has never been a priori=
ty here in the Columbia River Basin, where high-voltage power lines lope acr=
oss irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat.=20
Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain at great l=
ength, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basin's cheap electr=
icity and water.=20
Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of late. Havi=
ng fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday, they are skiddin=
g into the summer air-conditioning season desperately short of power. In the=
 last year, much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose =
monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America.=20
All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia, utility compa=
nies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California -- but=
 at a staggering price. Charging whatever California's dysfunctional power m=
arket will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have created=
 a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia.=20
With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness of=
 Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make stil=
l more power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders -- wh=
ile making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in No=
rth America. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned uti=
lity luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1=
=2E6 million customers.=20
Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may w=
ell be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the r=
egion. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power and=
 may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall.=20
''This is not nice money,'' said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a =
group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. ''It is something that=
 is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their air-conditi=
oners.''=20
Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.=20
North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility =
that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year t=
han it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last y=
ear had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000 e=
ach, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less than =
$25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear th=
eir children might be kidnapped.=20
The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowl=
edged that increases in the cost of power were ''huge'' and ''obscene.'' But=
 the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, ''We would be imprudent if we did =
not maximize this market for our customer owners.''=20
Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns tw=
o dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It ha=
d a record $88.8 million in profits last year -- more than double its best p=
revious year.=20
Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customers=
, is using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for =
local residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against po=
wer shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility est=
imates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming =
year.=20
Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to in=
sulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as now, =
local needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant an=
d Chelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.=20
Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving =
a share of its profits to its customers.=20
''How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people =
are paying more for electricity?'' asked Lon Topaz, director of resource man=
agement for the utility. ''It would be lousy politics.''=20
An Upside-Down Economy=20
The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined =
with California's deregulation mess to further distort the energy market. Dr=
ought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sol=
d on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year's price -- it ha=
s strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every me=
gawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long-ter=
m prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south t=
o California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings and a lo=
ng-distance bonanza.=20
As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower =
has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $44=
0 an acre not to farm.=20
Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year by=
 not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight =
Wall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by reselli=
ng hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a cheap long-term con=
tract.=20
Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars =
from the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its c=
ustomers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not use,=
 if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year's level.=20
For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California's=
 electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of priva=
te American utilities have also benefited from California's troubles.=20
BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and =
Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to exc=
eed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 million in=
 United States currency).=20
To celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it =
had never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for =
$130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, which=
 have not gone up for seven years.=20
''We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were b=
uilt by people of great foresight,'' said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of BC =
Hydro.=20
When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operat=
or, which runs that state's power grid, accused BC Hydro of market manipulat=
ion and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy.=20
''All they do is scream and shout and they won't pay you the money they owe =
you,'' he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help Cal=
ifornia in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said, add=
ing that it was California's ''awful mess'' in deregulating power markets th=
at fueled BC Hydro's record profits.=20
A Good Deal for Farmers=20
In the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the C=
olumbia from the world's premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable l=
akes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a third=
 of America's hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in t=
he Northwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-volta=
ge transmission lines did not exist.=20
The main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in =
the 1930's, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam in=
 North America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily des=
igned as a water-delivery device for farmers.=20
Since then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shut=
tle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columbia Ba=
sin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in fed=
eral infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, which=
 built it.=20
In addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia =
and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out =
of the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently sel=
ls for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin his=
torian, has written, farmers here have always felt that ''no price is too hi=
gh to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.''=20
This year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonnevil=
le Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricity from 29=
 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could persuade farm=
ers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water left in the C=
olumbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 million (if it had t=
o be purchased at current market prices).=20
In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville i=
s paying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for ea=
ch acre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County's public utility is p=
aying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land.=20
On April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe h=
ere in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year, th=
ey agreed that it was a good deal.=20
Still, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies =
that keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the preced=
ent they set when they traded water for cash.=20
''This has to be a temporary deal,'' said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms =
900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout. '=
'If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be no =
takers.''=20
Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting th=
e lifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were i=
nterviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their ta=
ble.=20
''We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full,'' said=
 Tricia C. Lubach, a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation far=
mer. ''Not too long ago they didn't worry about where the power comes from. =
Someday they may think about where the food comes from.''=20
A 'Wonderful Energy Fit'=20
A couple of hundred miles northwest of George, in a penthouse conference roo=
m that overlooks Vancouver harbor, Mr. Smith, the chairman of British Columb=
ia's most profitable company, explained in mid-April what a pain it was sell=
ing electricity to Californians.=20
''People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Cali=
fornians,'' he said. It does not help, he added, that the state is behind on=
 its bills by about $300 million.=20
Still, neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose Cal=
ifornia's money. The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget=
, which in the last decade has received more than $3.7 billion from BC Hydro=
=2E=20
''We have a wonderful energy fit,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro's =
power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians themselve=
s. ''We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand, and we=
 have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us.'=
'=20
BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell pow=
er when it is most needed -- and most expensive -- in California. The utilit=
y closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing water w=
hile meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power brought from =
across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucets and =
zaps electricity off to California.=20
''We spill water during the day,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Why? Is it because we c=
an make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants electricit=
y, for God's sake.''=20
Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in the=
 Northwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff s=
o far this year to about half of what is considered normal.=20
The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plants=
 and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capa=
city to generate it.=20
''Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quad=
rupling of the power rates,'' said Paul Norman, head of power operations at =
Bonneville.=20
Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that b=
y late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and=
 painfully expensive end.=20
