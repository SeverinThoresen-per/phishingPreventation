Well, just in that amount of time, I found out more about the deal....

I was inherited from CES.  CES had originally made the sale and when we=20
bought their book of business, we ended up with that sale.  You may want to=20
speak with Chris Germany about it, he was very involved with the CES=20
assimilation.
