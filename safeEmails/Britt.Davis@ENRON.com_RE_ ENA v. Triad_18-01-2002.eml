        Andy/Richard,

        Please be advised that I just got the postcard notice back from the =
court regarding the filing of our notice of non-suit in this matter.  I will=
 get a certified copy.

        By copy of this, I am asking Becky Zikes to do two things:

        1.  Call the Court and make absolutely sure that the hearing on our =
motion for default judgment scheduled for January 25 is cancelled, and if ne=
cessary, send a follow-up letter.
=09
         2.  If we haven't already done so, send the appropriate letter to t=
he AAA advising them that we are withdrawing our claim on a without-prejudic=
e basis.

       This will likely be my last communication on this file.  It has a bee=
n a pleasure representing you in this matter.

        Britt=09
         =20

      Andy,

      This is primarily for the benefit of the others on this e-mail.  Per y=
our authority, and in order to avoid further costs, I will be filing a notic=
e of non-suit in this matter, probably by the end of this week.  This will e=
ffectively dismiss this case without prejudice to refiling.  I will be doing=
 the same thing in the dormant AAA arbitration.  Accordingly, the presently-=
scheduled hearing on our motion for default, scheduled for January 25, will =
be cancelled, and we won't need to bother Bryce with that.  I will then be c=
losing my file on this matter.

     I will keep you advised.

      Britt

Subject:	FW: ENA v. Triad

        Andy,

        Subject to your and everyone else's thoughts, I recommend that we no=
n-suit this collection matter.
=09
       Triad was a small WMBE distributor of oil and gas based in Columbus, =
Maryland.  When the matter was referred to the Unit for filing suit, Triad h=
ad defaulted on the payment of $1,800,000 in spot gas sales.  When we invest=
igated, we learned that Triad's corporate charter had been yanked because of=
 the failure to pay state corporate franchise taxes prior to the time it beg=
an making sales to us.  Triad appeared to be operating out of the house of i=
ts principal, Sherwood Purnell.

       Tanya, Bill and I discussed at the time of referral that Triad may no=
t even have a sharpened pencil to satisfy a judgment.  As I recall, the thin=
king was that ENA wanted to set an example that counter-parties couldn't sim=
ply walk away from contracts without being pursued.  Also, I think mention w=
as made that a 10% chance of collecting on this judgment made it worthwhile.=
  Obviously, a lot has changed since then.

       We originally filed an arbitration demand under the AAA rules, pursua=
nt to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the spot gas sales contracts. =
 After several telefax services, it became clear that Triad wouldn't answer.=
  On the other hand, Purnell would call me up and offer to settle with ENA b=
y continuing to do business with ENA on some really awesome deals (this is t=
ongue-in-cheek).

      After consulting with Richard, I told the AAA that the arbitration sho=
uld be put on the back burner while we filed an action for default judgment =
in Texas court.  We have done this.  We still need to (a) finalize a motion =
for default judgment (b) prepare and present Bryce and me as witnesses at a =
hearing and (b) then go to Columbus to get our default judgment domesticated=
 and see if there are any assets to collect on .  That will likely require r=
etaining outside counsel in Maryland. =20

       I think it extraordinarily unlikely that we will find any non-exempt =
assets to collect on.

       I await your instructions.

       Britt

	Bryce,

	The hearing on the motion for default judgment by ENA against Triad, which =
had been set for tomorrow, Friday, December 14, at 10:00 a.m., has been rese=
t for Friday, January 25, at 10:00 a.m.  Is your schedule clear to attend?

	Many thanks.

	 Britt

	P.S. to Tarsha and Becky:  please put this on your calendars.  Corinne, the=
 clerk, is getting concerned about the number of times we have rescheduled t=
his, even though I told her it was because we kept having to wait on Soldier=
s and Sailors' affidavits.
