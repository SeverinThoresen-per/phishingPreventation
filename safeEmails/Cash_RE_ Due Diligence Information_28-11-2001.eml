 Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.=

 reached in the last 2 years (including discrimination, harassment, workers'=
 comp and ERISA claims, or otherwise), including any compliance agreements, =
consent decrees, etc. with any governmental agency (i.e..  OFCCP, EEOC, DOL,=
 etc.)

2.  List of any pending government compliance audits, administrative proceed=
ings, employee grievances regarding compliance with wage, overtime, or safet=
