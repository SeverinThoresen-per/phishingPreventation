Brian,
It is my understanding that the ISO has the right to get flat rate, (no=20
mileage charge) access into the ISO network from within the LATA of the A=20
POPs.  If this access is at the right price it means that any customer=20
wanting to get a circuit between say, Redding CA and Orange County, CA would=
=20
have VERY cheap access and competitive Long Haul.  That being said, at this=20
point I do not think the A POP information is crucial to our initial meeting=
=2E

We need to ascertain the following:
1) Can the ISO nail up discreet circuits on this network?  It is currently a=
=20
meshed ATM backbone with traffic being routed dynamically. =20
2) What conditions need to be met by the ISO to scale the network to OC48? =20
If they cannot scale it we have only about an OC3 of available bandwidth and=
=20
that is not worth our time.
3) What are the DS3 and OC3/12 access rated from MCI?  This will uncover our=
=20
true opportunity in this deal.
