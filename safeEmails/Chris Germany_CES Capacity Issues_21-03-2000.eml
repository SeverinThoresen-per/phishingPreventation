I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West=20
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dt=
s=20
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric=20
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the=20
worksheet.
