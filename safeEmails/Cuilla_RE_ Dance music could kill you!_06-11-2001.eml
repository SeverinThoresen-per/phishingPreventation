 	 Scientists kill mice with dance music
  <http://images.thisislondon.com/img/spacer.gif>
by Danielle Demetriou=20

Scientists who forced drugged mice to endure fatal doses of loud dance music=
 have been accused of " despicable" cruelty by animal welfare campaigners.=20

The study by Cambridge University examined how loud music strengthens the ha=
rmful effects of methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as speed.=20

Wendy Higgins of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: "=
These sick experiments are absolutely despicable. Just because people choose=
 to take drugs and go to raves doesn't justify subjecting animals to sufferi=
ng and death in a laboratory."=20

The scientists, who used a total of 238 mice in the experiment, concluded th=
at loud music strengthened the toxic effects of methamphetamine in animals.=20
