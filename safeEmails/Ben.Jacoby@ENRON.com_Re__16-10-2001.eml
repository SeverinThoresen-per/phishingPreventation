Louise:

Please keep in mind that as soon as FERC approval is received (which is expe=
cted in approx. 30 days), the statement below will no longer be true as the =
sale of our interest in Doyle to Walton EMC will become effective.

"Enron owns a 50 percent interest in Doyle I, LLC, an approximate 350 MW pea=
ker plant in Walton County, Georgia."

Let me know if you need anything else. See you at our meeting at 10 am tomor=
row.

Regards,
