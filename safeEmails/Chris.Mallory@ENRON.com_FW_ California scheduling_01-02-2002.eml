Due to the tentative completion date of the UBS deal, I think it would be wi=
se for me to resume the duties of scheduling the California book as of Monda=
y February 4, 2002. After meeting with Murray, I am under the impression tha=
t as of Wednesday you will be on UBS time and will not be doing the scheduli=
ng for the estate.  Let me know if you see a flaw in this plan, thanks, Sere=
na Bishop
