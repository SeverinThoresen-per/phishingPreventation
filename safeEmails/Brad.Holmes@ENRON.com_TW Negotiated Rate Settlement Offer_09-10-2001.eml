As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested =
that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a rec=
eipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested sh=
ipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it d=
oesn't provide the IS's the "last look" auction their looking for, it at lea=
st provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if ca=
pacity is available (eliminates any claim of "tortious process"); disadvanta=
ge: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas L=
ogistics. =20

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to th=
e parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a =
scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification a=
bove is offered, we know what the cost is.   =20

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and =
if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know. =20
