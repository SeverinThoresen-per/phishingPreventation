I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.  Dan will be out Monday=20
but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore. =20
Judy is out in the afternoons. =20

So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.  Vickie's role has not been fully=20
explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow.
