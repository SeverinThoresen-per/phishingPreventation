Sally,

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think=20
we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on=20
feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet=20
as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops=20
"process" or function:

1. Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after=20
close.
2. How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP.
3. The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionalit=
y=20
in place (and who is responsible for implementing this).=20

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves=
=20
closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a=20
description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you=20
listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what=20
they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a=
=20
memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other. =20

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the=20
other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob=20
Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron=
)=20
understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting=20
to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome=
=20
to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each=20
Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops=20
matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.   =20

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's=
=20
origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of=20
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. =
=20
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol=
"=20
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is no=
t=20
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply=20
e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of=20
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. =
=20
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled=20
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron=
)=20
to Steve Jackson (AEP). =20

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally=20
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the=20
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for=
=20
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasur=
y=20
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband=20
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an=20
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to=
=20
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's=20
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the=20
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures. =20

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition=20
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of=20
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have=20
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require=20
actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we=20
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP lis=
t=20
or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we=
=20
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or=
=20
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your=20
requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you=
=20
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and=20
AEP. =20

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update=
=20
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I sugges=
t=20
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:=20

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so=
=20
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and=20
their status, or=20

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a=20
firsthand update to the two of you. =20

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can=20
incorporate that into our schedules for next week. =20
