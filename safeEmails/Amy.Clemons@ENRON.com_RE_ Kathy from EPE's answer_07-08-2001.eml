Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they w=
ant to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in t=
he individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it=
 would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking =
to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as j=
ust part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out=
=2E  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final =
blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this.
