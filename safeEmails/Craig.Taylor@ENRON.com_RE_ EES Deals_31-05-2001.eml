Jeff,

As I discussed with you before, I believe the problems started a couple of w=
eeks ago when EES began e-mailing me in response to quotes and assuming we'r=
e "done" without verbally executing with me via telephone. At the time the p=
roblem started, we were migrating to Microsoft Outlook and I had problems mi=
grating over causing a several day delay in receiving all e-mail. I have exp=
licitly expressed to them I must have verbal confirmation over the phone, NO=
 exeptions. They will continue to e-mail me and we can facilitate the initia=
ling/booking in the manner you have sugggested. However, upon verbal executi=
on of transactions I can immediately let the trader know and manage the book=
ing process. It was my understanding this matter was resolved last week. I h=
ave not even quoted, much less transacted, on anything with EES since I was =
under the mutual impression that all of our "ducks were in a row" with regar=
d to EES. Tuesday, Brad's book admin came to me early with unwritten transac=
tions that were several days old. Moments later, the book admin came to me a=
nd said he was mistaken - everything was o.k. Yesterday, Sandra called me  w=
ith a similar problem (EES was trying to confirm transactions she had quoted=
 some time ago). The contact I deal with at EES was out and will be out unti=
l Monday. However, I called his supervisor that makes the decision to transa=
ct and is usually in the loop on these transactions and he was not aware of =
any deals unconfirmed since we straightened everything out. So, I apologize =
for this mess and as soon as Jim Barker returns I will get everything cleare=
d up. In the future, I will not accept any deals from EES that I do not verb=
ally execute - that way I can immediately notify the trader and you guys/gal=
s in booking. Please let me know if you have additional suggestions, and aga=
in, I apologize for any difficulty this has caused.

Craig,

As per our discussion last week, all email trade correspondences from Enron =
Energy Services detailing the term, volume, location and bids/offers will be=
 sufficient enough for Risk to book the deals directly into our systems.   T=
herefore, it will not be necessary to write up a ticket for any subsequent l=
ong term EES deals.  =20

Please print out the EES email correspondences and give to the appropriate t=
rader so that they may initialize it.   I hope this will aid us in the futur=
e in getting any subsequent EES deals entered into our systems and confirmed=
 within a couple of days.

Thanks in advance,

Jeff Royed
