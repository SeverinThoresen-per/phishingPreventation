Melissa:

Can you please give me an update on the Harbor Cogen payment?  We told the c=
lient they were going to be paid today.  I phoned Godfrey who couldn't tell =
me the status.  I will need to inform the client what is going on first thin=
g in the morning.

Let me know if there is anything I can be doing to avoid situations like thi=
s in the future.=20

Thanks

C =20
