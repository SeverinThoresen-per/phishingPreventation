Hey Jim,

While I was out on vacation last week, Patrick unwound some positions that=20
brought Westpark onto the radar screen.  Not having my understanding or=20
knowledge of this relationship, the credit analyst looking at the trades=20
asked the market risk to run a 5-day VAR.  Excluding December, the open=20
position (which later was completely unwound) had positive 5-day VAR that=20
exceeded the collateral being held, i.e. $1.5MM.  Because Patrick did=20
eventually close out his position while deep in the money, their is no credi=
t=20
risk on any of his business.  However, combing the volatile nature of this=20
price environment (prompt, gas daily being so dramatic), large volumes, and=20
one sided nature of trading, we are now uncomfortable with the $300M/Bcf rul=
e.

Until the market calms a bit, what was once quoted as $300M for each Bcf=20
open, is now $1MM for each Bcf open.  This collateral to be posted upfront. =
=20
By increasing this multiple, we should easily be able to stay within the 99t=
h=20
percentile of probable VAR.

Please communicate this strategy to Patrick and let me know if you would lik=
e=20
to schedule a meeting to further discuss.

thanks
brant
