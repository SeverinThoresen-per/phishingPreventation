Dave,

As I left on your voicemail, I would like to discuss RAC support for Enron P=
rincipal Investments.  This is really broken down into two components:  1) t=
he current portfolio, and 2) new investments.  For now, I am most concerned =
about the current portfolio.  There are over 80 investments in the portfolio=
 for which we are now responsible.  These range from a $120 million investme=
nt in publicly traded ADR's of COPEL (a Brazilian utility) to a $150,000 inv=
estment in the Creole Shack (a local Houston restaurant).  I assume that mos=
t of these positions already have a designated underwriter to the deal.

Also, I would like to have a full day review session with you, and the relev=
ant members of your group, to discuss lessons learned from past investments =
and the strategy of our group going forward.  My assistant will contact you =
to set this up (hopefully sometime in late July).

I appreciate your help in these matters.

Thanks,

KG
