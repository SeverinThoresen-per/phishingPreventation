Hi!

           Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to=20
confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of=20
Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in plac=
e=20
for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enro=
n=20
and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current=20
purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.


                                                                            =
