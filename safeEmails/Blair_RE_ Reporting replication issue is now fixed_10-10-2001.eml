Yesterday we noticed a problem where reports were not reporting on the corre=
ct cycle, or were not picking up information between cycles.  As it turns ou=
t, an important table was not being replicated from the application database=
 to the reporting database. =20

I was told that this problem has been fixed, and on first inspection of the =
tables, everything looks correct.
