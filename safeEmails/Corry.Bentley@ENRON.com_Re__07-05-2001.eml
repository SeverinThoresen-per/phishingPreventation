John,
I could use one or two interns / associates for the Summer.  It will be a gr=
eat way for them to see how the trading side of our business relates to the =
physical delivery on the grid.  I have discussed this with Lloyd Will and it=
 fill a need I face in light of the new "Services" group.  I will probably l=
ose two of my regular schedulers to that group, and another (Maria Valdes) t=
o help trade various Cinergy positions as per Fletch. =20

Thanks,

Corry Bentley
