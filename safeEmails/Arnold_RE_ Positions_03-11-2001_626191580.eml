      John

      The simplest thing would be to disregard the 926 Aug'03 instructions
   and
      to
      do the 1660 May 02 only....

      Your call

      The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we
      received
      today.

      Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
      position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02
   futures.

      If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and
   734
      May
      02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of
      those
      expits are achieved.

      Kevin

         Dear John

         In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you
      yesterday,
         I
         propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it
      includes
         no
         options at all.

         short 1660 May 2002 futures

         Please understand that this entire affair is making me as
      uncomfortable
         as
         it is clearly making you.

         Kind regards
         Kevin R Davis
