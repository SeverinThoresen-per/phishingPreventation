Deal # 454471 and Deal # 418249 are both set up for contract 69357. Deal #=20
418249 matches the invoice so I think Deal # 454471 needs to be killed. =20

The rate and volumes on Deal # 454471 match the invoice for contract 69759=20
but Deal # 460384 is set for this contract.

Bottom line - we have an extra deal (454471) in the system according to how=20
we were invoiced.

If you agree, please have Elizabeth kill the deal .

thanks,
Brenda
