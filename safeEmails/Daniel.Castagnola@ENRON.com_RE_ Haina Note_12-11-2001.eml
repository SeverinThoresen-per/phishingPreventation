Ray,

Thanks for the feedback.  We'll get started right away.  With regard to the =
points below:

1 - I agree.  Divestitures, like acquisitions, require DASHs.=20

2 - This should not be a problem.  The only rep. that I believe we'll have t=
o give is that we own the note free and clear of any liens.  The rep. will b=
e given by the holder of the note, Enron Caribe, Ltd.

3 - I will have to confirm sure that the buyers are still interested on buyi=
ng the note.  I will let you know as soon as I know.  I have been talking to=
 Michael Bax, Basic Energy - they own equity interest on the plant, and Humb=
erto Sangiovanni with Banco Popular, a local Dominican bank.  People from EG=
A are aware of these individuals.

 I'll keep everyone posted and will get someone from EGA to help so that the=
y can be in the loop.

 Dan

Rod Hayslett has agreed to support the sale of the Haina note.  Please proce=
ed.=20

1)      I want a DASH on the transaction.  RAC signoff on any asset sales is=
 policy.  I view the sale of a note as policy.

2)      I want to make sure that Enron is not making any substantive reps or=
 warranties that could bite us.=20
3)      I want to know who the buyer is.=20
