The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen=20
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party=20
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract. =20

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one o=
f=20
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.
