After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears=
 that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although the=
y don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the optio=
n of the TO, so we "may" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to o=
ffer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be=
 possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) ever=
y 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage =
risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduli=
ng time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a fi=
nancial solution that provides for our needs.
