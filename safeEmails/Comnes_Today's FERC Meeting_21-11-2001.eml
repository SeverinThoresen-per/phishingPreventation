Summary of today's meeting from our trade association and a news article pic=
ked up by Steve Hall.

GAC=20

FYI.  At today's FERC meeting two sets of items were voted out that pertain =
directly to the CA markets.  This summary is based upon the discussion at th=
e meeting, and the actual orders will contain additional details that may no=
t be reflected here.  A subsequent email will circulate with links to the FE=
RC orders once they are posted.

1)  FERC voted out an order granting in part, and denying in part, the Relia=
nt / Mirant complaint against CAISO.  The order builds on the 11/7 creditwor=
thiness order and finds that DWR is a Scheduling Coordinator, that it should=
 not have access to confidential information not also available to others, a=
nd that DWR should be scheduling and operating pursuant to the CAISO tariff.

During the discussion on this item, Massey noted concern about CAISO allegat=
ion that the BEEP stack is not reliable b/c generators are not following dis=
patch instructions.  Massey wants CAISO to promptly inform the Commission wh=
ere they believe an entity is not complying with the tariff or failing to fo=
llow the dispatch instruction.

2) The second set of orders involves three dockets: (a) a new 206 rulemaking=
 regarding market-based rate authority; (b) revision of the market power tes=
t, made in the context of a triennial review of market based rate authority;=
 and (c) a narrow exemption to the FERC market mitigation for entities with =
market power pursuant to the order in (b).

FERC is putting out a new rulingmaking regarding market-based rate authority=
 to close what they find to be a flaw with existing tariffs in the wake of C=
alifornia's problems.  The rulemaking initiated today calls for the impositi=
on of a refund provision in all market-based rates.  The refund requirement =
attaches to "bad behavior" such as economic or physical withholding or other=
 anticompetitive actions.  Apparently there is a portion of the rulemaking t=
hat asks for comments within 15 days.  During discussion, Massey pointed out=
 that no "bad behavior" was found in California, and that customers should n=
ot be forced to bear the burden where the market goes out of control.

FERC has revised the market power analysis used to support a request for mar=
ket-based rate authority.  FERC is now establishing a "supply margin analysi=
s" (SMA) to replace the "hub & spoke" analysis used to determine the presenc=
e of market power.  The SMA looks for "pivotal" suppliers based on peak dema=
nd within a market.  The definition of the market would recognize the role o=
f transmission constraints.  A generator is considered "pivotal" where its s=
upply is required to meet system peak demand.  If such status is found, the =
market-based rate authority does not extend to those peak conditions, and in=
stead the applicable rates are a cost-based rate that is applicable only to =
the uncommitted unit capacity.  Rates for any such capacity would be posted =
in INCs and DECs for that uncommitted capacity.  This policy revision occurs=
 in the context of a triennial review of market based rate authority for AEP=
, Southern and Entergy.  Additional details will be in the order and we'll s=
end an email
with links when it gets posted.

The last item would create a narrow exemption to the application of SMA and =
maket power mitigation in the case where the supplier is in a ISO or RTO wit=
h existing, FERC-approved market mitigation mechanisms.  While this order wa=
s to be adopted along with the other two noted above, it was held for some r=
evisions and is expected to come out either later today or tomorrow.  The co=
ntext for this order is the Huntington Beach application.  The language revi=
sions are aimed at addressing concerns that at the end of the west-wide miti=
gation in the coming September, there would not be an effective replacement =
mitigation mechanism at CAISO.

We will have a short discussion on these items during the FERC call at 10 am=
 today.  ABB

WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on T=
uesday said it has jurisdiction over California's main power purchasing arm,=
 the California Department of Water Resources, which took over buying power =
for much of the state earlier this year.=20
FERC also told the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which manag=
es the power grid, to stop giving preferential treatment to the state water =
agency.=20
As a power scheduling coordinator for PG&E Corp and Edison International's S=
outhern California Edison, the water department must file with FERC a tariff=
 schedule, FERC staffers said at a commission meeting. Those schedules are r=
outinely required of other market players.=20
The water department also should not be privy to market information unavaila=
ble to other market participants, the commission said. Such information shar=
ing constitutes "preferential treatment of the ISO towards the (state) water=
 department, said FERC Commissioner William Massey.=20
The California ISO manages the state's transmission grid and runs a complica=
ted daily power auction to match buyers and sellers. FERC is currently audit=
ing the ISO.=20
The California Department of Water Resources became the state's only credit-=
worthy buyer earlier this year. The state stepped into the role after power =
shortages and impending price spikes barred direct purchases by the state's =
two largest utilities.=20
Pacific Gas & Electric filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April a=
nd SoCal Edison's credit is rated junk status.=20
Generators accused the California ISO of sharing sensitive market informatio=
n with the water department and tilting its auction rules to favor long-term=
 contracts inked in the wake of the power crisis.=20
Power generators Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy Inc. have complained to FER=
C that information-sharing between the water department and the California I=
SO violates the California ISO's tariff.
