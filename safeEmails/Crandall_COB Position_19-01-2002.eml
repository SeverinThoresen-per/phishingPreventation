I understand that there are some questions with respect to how we are handli=
ng our COB length each day.  The easiest way to explain it is for people to =
reference our cash trading sheets (p:\trading\california\cascheduling\cash\p=
osition\nw\2002\jan2002\pos01**nw.xlw) and give either Diana or myself a cal=
l.

Basically for January we are long at COB approximately 118 MW onpeak and 193=
 MW offpeak.  This is BPA length.  Towards the beginning of the month we wer=
e importing most of that length into California.  After the first week we st=
arted doing swaps with Avista to move the COB length to cover our MC short (=
mostly BPA).  The BPA length at COB is slightly out of the money, but it is =
my understanding we are to leave BPA intact.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
