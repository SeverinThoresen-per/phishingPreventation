Hi Nik

This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embaras=
sed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation =
timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  =
But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You mig=
ht want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.

Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, =
next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to =
smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy=
 to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity=
 for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it mi=
ght be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and=
 down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
=20
I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to=
 core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and comp=
lacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market=
 economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. S=
ay hi to Cindy and Noah.

I am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you=
 know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at =
the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I=
 am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But=
 we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will mov=
e with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing =
works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am=
 going to do in Vancouver.
=20
But I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportun=
ities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron it=
self has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that su=
ddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right=
 word to describe it.
=20
Bye for now and keep in touch.
