A state Senate committee is investigating why Morgan Stanley, a financial=20
adviser to several power generators, destroyed documents that could show a=20
well-planned effort to gouge California consumers.=20
After several weeks of asking for the documents, and getting a positive=20
response from Morgan Stanley, the Senate committee was told last week that=20
the documents were destroyed as a matter of routine "years ago."
"I got a call Wednesday from a Washington, D.C., counsel for Morgan Stanley,=
=20
who said, 'I regret to inform you the documents have been destroyed,' " Sen.=
=20
Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), chairman of the Senate investigating=20
committee, said yesterday.=20
The revelation came as the Senate moved against another company under=20
scrutiny by Dunn's committee -- Enron Corp., the world's largest energy=20
trader. The Senate was meeting yesterday to vote on the 2001-02 state budget=
=20
but approved another step in contempt proceedings against Houston's Enron fo=
r=20
its refusal to hand over documents to committee investigators.=20
The central question is whether power companies colluded to raise prices by=20
purposely withholding electricity. At one point this year, the price of powe=
r=20
was the highest in state history -- more than $5,000 per megawatt -- as=20
supplies sank to unusually low levels.=20
The Senate inquiry into Morgan Stanley involves activity years before the=20
energy crisis. Investigators suspect that power companies and their financia=
l=20
advisers knew well before the crisis began that prices could be raised. Any=20
records confirming that suspicion would be evidence of extraordinary market=20
power.=20
At the time deregulation was being implemented during the late 1990s, nearly=
=20
everyone involved was talking about how competition would push down the pric=
e=20
of electricity. At the same time, however, power companies like North=20
Carolina's Duke Energy Corp. were paying inflated prices to purchase power=20
plants in California.=20
After deregulation, the power companies paid nearly $2 billion total for=20
aging plants worth an estimated $1.1 billion.=20
"Electricity prices were stable and there was an oversupply (of energy) at=20
the time, and these were the oldest units they were buying," Dunn said. "Why=
=20
would they pay two or three times for these plants?"=20
Dunn requested that Morgan Stanley (now called Morgan Stanley Dean Witter)=20
provide all the supporting documentation regarding the purchase of the=20
plants. He said he received commitments from company attorneys that no=20
documents had been destroyed.=20
A representative with Morgan Stanley declined to comment yesterday. But a=20
Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register, which reported the=20
story yesterday, that the company did not destroy any documents after the=20
first May 16 request from Dunn's committee.=20
"At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep and=20
what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years before=20
the energy crisis and years before this committee existed," attorney Paul=20
Patono told the Register.=20
Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices or exert "market power," as lon=
g=20
as the energy companies don't collude. But the issue is important to federal=
=20
regulators, who could impose price controls on energy if they believe the=20
system is not truly competitive.=20
Only a few power firms have refused to hand over documents that the Senate=20
committee has requested. Last week, Dunn's committee voted to move forward=20
with contempt fines against Enron and Reliant Energy. They also authorized=20
the committee to depose executives from the companies.=20
Dunn also has recommended fines that would start at $1,000 on the first day=20
and double each subsequent day. A $1,000 fine imposed on a Monday would rise=
=20
to $16,000 by Friday, then double to $32,000 on Saturday. A week of delay=20
would cost Enron $127,000.=20

"They can afford it," Burton said yesterday about the proposed fines against=

Enron. "That's like pocket change. Ken Lay (chairman of Enron) spends more=20

Enron representatives could not be reached for comment. Their attorneys have=

Enron files suit over subpoena / Provider challenges move for documents

In another escalation in the war between California and out-of- state energy=
=20
providers, Enron Corp. filed a lawsuit yesterday challenging the=20
Legislature's authority to subpoena company documents.=20
The suit came as a Senate panel investigating market manipulation voted 6 to=
=20
0 to move forward with a contempt motion against Enron. A report will be=20
forwarded to the full Senate early next week if the marketer continues to=20
refuse to comply with the subpoena.
"You just went to war with the state of California," Sen. Steve Peace, D-El=20
Cajon, told the lawyer representing Enron. ". . . You already initiated a wa=
r=20
economically; now you're in a political war."=20
The Senate committee investigating price manipulation found Enron and Mirant=
=20
Corp. in contempt last month for not turning over subpoenaed documents. The=20
finding against Mirant was vacated yesterday because it agreed to turn over=20
documents.=20
The committee, chaired by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, requested documents=20
from power providers in early April. When the requests were ignored, the=20
committee issued subpoenas asking generators for documents covering business=
=20
plans, operations, risk management and investment strategies.=20
Peace argued that forcing a judge to decide the scope of the Legislature's=20
authority could provoke a constitutional crisis.=20
"You are treading into the territory of asking the court to make judgment on=
=20
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," Peace said.=20
"It is a separation of powers issue of the highest order."=20
But Michael Kirby, a lawyer hired by Enron, said the Houston company was=20
simply looking for due process.=20
"A subpoena is a subpoena and once you go that route you must comply with th=
e=20
law," he told the committee. "We are entitled to some kind of hearing with a=
=20
neutral arbitrator. It was not our preference to file a lawsuit."=20
Kirby and the lawsuit cite several objections to the Senate's subpoena. Thes=
e=20
include the confidentiality of the documents and whether a California body=20
can require documents from outside the state. Enron also says that only=20
federal regulators have the power to subpoena their records.=20
Kirby and members of the committee disagreed over the scope of what a=20
legislative subpoena covers versus one used in a criminal matter.=20
"I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding about our legislative=20
inquiry," Dunn said. "We are not drawing conclusions about guilt or=20
innocence. We want to see what fixes must be made in the law."=20
Kirby did say Enron has set up a depository in Sacramento and has 30,000=20
documents ready to be deposited, pending an agreement can be reached on=20
confidentiality issues.=20
But that is not good enough for committee members, who believe that Enron ha=
s=20
continue to evade the committee.=20
"We have no indication that Enron ever intends to comply with the subpoena,"=

State legislators pressed forward with contempt findings against Enron Corp.=
=20
on Wednesday after the company failed to produce subpoenaed documents and=20
filed a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf.=20
Lawmakers on a special Senate committee investigating electricity price=20
manipulation warned that the voluminous lawsuit, filed in Sacramento Superio=
r=20
Court, could have far-reaching implications for the Legislature's ability to=
=20
conduct investigations and make findings. A few even suggested the legal=20
action could trigger "a constitutional crisis" that could end up in the=20
California or U.S. supreme court.
"You are treading into the territory of asking a court to make judgment on=20
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," said state=20
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon. "It is a separation of powers issue of the=20
highest order."=20
Representatives from Enron, a power marketer based in Houston, said they are=
=20
merely concerned that the committee has violated their due process rights.=20
Enron and another company, Mirant, were initially found in contempt by the=20
committee June 28 for refusing to turn over thousands of pages of documents=20
that had been subpoenaed June 11.=20
But the committee offered the companies a reprieve. If they complied with th=
e=20
subpoenas, signed confidentiality agreements and set up a document depositor=
y=20
in Sacramento by Tuesday, the contempt findings would be expunged.=20
Committee attorney Laurence Drivon reported at the hearing that Mirant had=20
complied with the requirements, and had set up a document depository in the=20
U.S. Bank building downtown.=20
Mirant spokesman Patrick Dorinson said 159,000 pages of documents had been=20
turned over in 44 boxes as of Wednesday morning.=20
As a result, the panel voted to purge the contempt findings against Mirant,=20
but said it would review the company's compliance again in about 30 days.=20
Enron, however, did not turn over any documents or sign a confidentiality=20
agreement since the last hearing, Drivon said, and negotiations yielded=20
little progress. On a 6-0 vote, the panel agreed to move forward with=20
contempt proceedings against Enron.=20
As early as next week, the committee will forward a report to the Senate,=20
which will vote on the contempt findings and levy punishments that could=20
range from jail time for company officials to steep fines.=20
The panel said Enron could still purge the contempt findings if it complies=20
with the subpoena before the report is forwarded.=20
But company officials fired back at the committee, accusing members of=20
unfairly singling out Enron and treating it differently from other energy=20
companies.=20
"It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the committee's actions are=20
designed to uncover the facts underlying the price spikes in California's=20
wholesale electric power market, or to create a convenient political=20
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for California's policy mistakes," one=20
official wrote to the committee.=20
All along, Enron officials have said they have several objections to the=20
committee's process. They believe the panel is violating the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction in its investigation; that it isn't=20
entitled to documents that are stored outside California; and that it doesn'=
t=20
have the right to the confidential information and trade secrets in the=20
documents.=20
They also argue that their due process rights have been violated because the=
y=20
received no response to their written objections to the subpoena before the=20
June 28 contempt vote.=20
The committee chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, overruled most of their=20
objections Wednesday. However, Enron officials argued it's unfair for a=20
committee member to rule on their objections.=20
"It is a foregone conclusion that the objections are going to be overruled,"=
=20
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said at the hearing.=20
Officials believe an impartial third party should determine the merits of=20
their concerns, which was a primary reason the company filed the lawsuit,=20
said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.=20
In the lawsuit, Enron seeks a court injunction to end contempt proceedings=20
until the company's objections "have been duly considered and ruled upon by=20
an impartial hearing officer."=20
But Dunn said the Legislature's investigations are different from court=20
inquiries, and so are its procedures. "The same due process concerns=20
applicable to a court proceeding are not equally applicable to an=20
investigation by the Legislature," he said.=20
He denied the committee had singled out Enron, and said he believes Enron's=20
lawsuit is really asking the court to force the Legislature to end its=20
investigation.=20
The committee is scheduled to consider contempt findings against other power=
=20
companies next week.=20
"Enron (has) raised, potentially, a constitutional crisis with this=20
litigation," Dunn said.=20
Constitutional scholar Clark Kelso said legislators clamoring about a=20
constitutional crisis may be exaggerating. But Kelso, a professor at McGeorg=
e=20
School of Law in Sacramento, believes the suit should be dismissed because i=
t=20
is premature. He said the contempt process is still under way in the Capitol=
,=20
and has yet to be acted upon by the Senate.=20
Reacting to Enron's claims that an impartial third party should hear its=20
objections, Kelso also disagreed. "A court is not going to hold a Senate=20
committee to the same standard of impartiality it would hold a judge to," he=
=20
said.

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator=

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy=20
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation=
=2E=20
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information=
=20
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But=20
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without=
=20
Duke's consent.
The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in=
=20
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughou=
t=20
the state.=20
Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts t=
o=20
enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information=20
cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.=20
Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that=
=20
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=20
which stay secret.=20
"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wha=
t=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.=20
Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers=20
Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informatio=
n=20
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."=20
Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month=
=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wha=
t=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.=20
But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.=20
Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.=20
But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data=
,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.=20
"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.=20
To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.=20
Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.=20
Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records th=
e=20
committee plans to turn over.=20
"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we are=
=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=20
know what we are ultimately going to do."=20
The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, hav=
e=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=20
were cited.=20
Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formall=
y=20
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the=
=20
final arbiter of such issues.=20
Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited=20
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most=20
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

Calif Pwr Plant Outages Dn In Jun, Still Top 2000 -Report

07/09/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The average amount of electricity generating=20
capacity unavailable to California due to breakdowns or planned maintenance=20
at power plants fell by half in June from the three previous months, the=20
California Energy Commission said Monday.=20
But the 6,758 megawatts of generation that was off line on average last mont=
h=20
was still more than twice the 2,683 MW off line in June 2000.
Generators, including Duke Energy (DUK), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Dyneg=
y=20
Inc. (DYN), said that's because the half-century-old power plants ran at=20
maximum capacity during the past year to help cover the state's massive=20
electricity shortfall.=20
Generators said there's nothing suspicious about the increased amount of=20
capacity that went off line this year. In fact, they schedule maintenance a=20
year in advance.=20
"We ran the heck out of our plants," said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. "Thes=
e=20
plants are about 50 years old. They broke down because we ran them so hard."=
=20
In addition, about 5,000 MW of generation operated by small power producers=20
known as qualifying facilities shut down their units this spring, because=20
they were owed for power supplied to Edison International (EIX) unit Souther=
n=20
Californa Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric. Those=20
plants began operating again late last month after striking deals to settle=20
their claims.=20
State officials, however, believe the generators have purposely kept their=20
power plants off line to drive-up wholesale electricity prices. State Sen.=20
Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said it appears generators have the ability to=20
influence wholesale power prices and have done so by forcing some of their=20
units off line.=20
"Whether they did it in a concerted fashion is the question we're trying to=20
answer," Dunn said. "But it's clear that some of these plants may have shut=20
down for unnecessary maintenance."=20
The amount of generation off line between March and May averaged 14,026 MW,=20
according to the commission's report. Since January, average outages each=20
month have run about twice as high as the same month the year before.=20
The numbers are based on calculations made by the state's Independent System=
=20
Operator, manager of the electricity grid, which keeps track of the outages.=

More Employees To Testify Vs Calif Generators -Senator

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Current and former power plant employees are=20
expected to testify soon against California's major power suppliers, allegin=
g=20
the companies manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market in an=20
effort to boost power prices, the head of the state Senate committee=20
investigating the claims told Dow Jones Newswires.=20
The whistleblowers are non-management employees who work for or were once=20
employed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR)=
,=20
Williams Cos. (WMB) and Duke Energy (DUK), said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa=
=20
Ana, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price=20
Manipulation.
"We have been dealing with a whole number of whistleblowers to provide their=
=20
view, whether good or bad," Dunn said. "These are whistleblowers from=20
virtually all five generators who are either current or former employees."=20
California is seeking $9 billion in refunds from suppliers, which it accuses=
=20
of price gouging. The state also hopes to pursue criminal charges against=20
power company executives.=20
So far, Dunn's committee has only heard testimony from former employees of=20
Duke. The testimony against the other generators could come as early as July=
=20
10, Dunn said. Some of the whistleblowers are concerned about losing their=20
jobs or being blacklisted once they testify, he said.=20
Two former employees of Duke's South Bay power plant are slated to testify=20
Thursday before the Senate committee that Duke reduced output at the=20
706-megawatt power plant to drive up wholesale power prices.=20
Last month, three former Duke power plant employees testified that Duke=20
tossed out spare parts and "ramped down" two turbines during power=20
emergencies. The men produced control room logs to back up their testimony.=20
"The testimony by the new whistleblowers is headed in the same direction as=20
the other three (Duke) employees," Dunn said, adding that evidence may=20
include some control room logs that show power plants being ramped up and=20
down.=20
The California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power=20
grid, admitted last week that Duke was acting on its orders when the company=
=20
reduced output at the plant, but said it issued those orders because Duke's=20
power prices were too high.=20
Generators Deny Manipulation=20

Energy companies will have an opportunity to give their side of the story to=
=20
the committee by the end of the month, Dunn said.=20
The companies deny allegations they manipulated the market.=20
"We have not withheld," said Mirant spokesman Pat Dorinson. "We have not=20
manipulated the market. We follow dispatch instructions given to us by the=20
ISO."=20
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said the company hasn't been told by Dunn's=20
office that anyone would be making specific allegations about its operations=
=2E=20
Repeating an argument used by Duke, Stengel said plant employees weren't=20
aware of the big picture.=20
"No one at our power plants is in a position to know why the plants ramp up=20
and down," Stengel said. "Communication is between the ISO and the Dynegy=20
marketing staff. We take dispatch orders from the ISO."=20
Dunn said additional employees have come forward since the Duke employees=20
first testified and that his staff interviews potential whistleblowers.=20
"We see if they have something to add to the investigation," Dunn said.=20
Despite the emergence of new witnesses, Dunn wouldn't claim to have found a=20
"smoking gun."=20
"I tend to shy away from that term," Dunn said. "To be honest, if a (smoking=
=20
gun) exists, I doubt we will ever get our hands on it."=20
Dunn's committee started its hearings three months ago. The senator said he=20
has concluded that generators have the ability to set the price of wholesale=
=20
electricity and should be stripped of their ability to charge market rates.=20
"We still have to hear from the generators," Dunn said. "But it seems very=20
clear that the Big Five generators have market power. The question is how do=
=20
they exercise market power and what is the impact on the price? If market=20
power has been exercised in a concerted fashion, that's a potential antitrus=
t=20
charge. That's illegal."=20
The committee will continue its investigation through the summer break, whic=
h=20
begins July 15, and expects to complete its probe by September, Dunn said.=20

A state Senate committee held Enron and Mirant corporations in contempt=20
yesterday for not turning over subpoenaed documents as six other energy=20
companies made frantic, last-minute deals to comply with the lawmakers'=20
orders.=20
The contempt finding is the first of its kind since 1929 when a Senate panel=
=20
investigating price fixing in cement prices briefly jailed a Portland=20
businessman for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
"Jailing is an option and we preserve all options at this point," said state=

charges of price manipulation in the wholesale electricity market.=20
Although Dunn's committee voted 5 to 0 to find the companies in contempt, th=

When the requests were ignored, the committee issued subpoenas on June 11=20
asking generators for documents covering business plans, operations, risk=20

Based on their pledges yesterday to cooperate with the committee, six energy=

As committee members met, generators' lawyers stepped into hallways and made=

hurried calls from cell phones to their corporate headquarters, and one=20

"While we have received certain documents today, we have no idea what has=20
been given to us," Dunn said. "That it has taken until today to get these=20
responses is unfortunate and disturbing."=20
Enron drew most of the wrath from the committee after sending only a letter=20
questioning the committee's jurisdiction. The company also criticized an=20
investigation by Attorney General Bill Lockyer, which company officials=20
called "fatally and irreparably compromised" by what it said was blatant=20

Lockyer has said in published articles that the heads of some of the power=20

"There is clearly a stark contrast in the conduct in the marketplace between=

Enron and other companies," said Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon. "The irony of=

the Enron letter is that they were the architect of the whole (deregulation)=

An Enron spokeswoman reached after the hearing declined to comment.=20

He also agreed that except for a few minor changes the company would agree t=

Under the plan, information such as trade secrets and other proprietary=20
information would be kept confidential and companies would receive a 10-day=20
notice if the committee planned to make public any confidential materials.=20
The company would then have that time to ask for a court order preventing an=

A lawyer for Williams Energy agreed to the same conditions as Duke, and an=20
attorney for Mirant pursued a similar strategy but stopped short of pledging=
=20
that all documents would be made available.=20
A Mirant spokesman said later that the company has compiled thousands of=20

SACRAMENTO The Senate might exercise its contempt powers for the first time=20
in more than 70 years if electricity producers fail today to obey a subpoena=
=20
ordering them to turn over documents that would provide an inside look at=20
their business practices, lawmakers said Wednesday.=20
The power producers are flying in representatives to appear before a Senate=20
committee today, but they are not expected to turn over any of the documents=
,=20
which were first requested in April.
They are seeking a protective order that would ban the committee from=20
disclosing the information to the public or to other government agencies,=20
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum,=20
which represents many of the major power producers.=20
"They want to have some control over these confidential documents, and they=20
have this right," Ackerman said. "The Senate has subpoena powers, but they=20
also have obligations."=20
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana -- who chairs the Senate committee that=20
issued the subpoenas -- said he hopes the power producers will comply, but i=
f=20
they don't he'll be forced to take more aggressive actions.=20
There are two possibilities, including the reissuance of subpoenas, this tim=
e=20
naming company officials instead of a faceless corporation. The full Senate=20
would have the power then to throw the named person in jail, as it did in=20
1929 when the Legislature was investigating the cement industry for possible=
=20
collusion and price- fixing. In that case, the state Supreme Court stood=20
behind the Senate's authority.=20
The focus of Dunn's committee is similar to the 1929 investigation. He is=20
looking into accusations of collusion and price fixing, this time among some=
=20
of the nation's largest electricity producers.=20
Dunn said the other possible action is to ask the full Senate to hold the=20
companies in contempt, and order that they turn over the documents or face=20
possible court action. Failure to comply with a legislative subpoena is a=20
misdemeanor. The Senate also could probably ask the court to intervene in th=
e=20
dispute, said Matthew Jacobs, an attorney who's studied the Legislature's=20
powers in this area.=20
"It is my sincere hope that we can avoid the ultimate penalty for=20
noncompliance, which is to jail the individual to comply," Dunn said. "There=
=20
is no legal basis for refusing to comply with the legislative subpoena based=
=20
on an assertion of confidentiality."=20
Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the Senate will likely=20
support whatever action the committee asks it to take.=20
"The Senate would probably support what they would want to do," Burton said.=
=20
"If they make the case, then we will probably take the action that they=20
believe is appropriate."=20
Jacobs, who served as special counsel to the Assembly during the hearings=20
that led to the resignation of former Insurance Commissioner Chuck=20
Quakenbush, said the Legislature's subpoena power is the greatest when a=20
specific person is named.=20
"The (Senate) sergeant-at- arms goes out and places the person under arrest=20
and takes him down to the county jail," said Jacobs. "If they comply with th=
e=20
subpoena, they can get out of jail. You can't throw a corporation in jail."=20
In the 1929 case, the sergeant-at-arms arrested H.T. Battelle, secretary of=20
the Pacific Portland Cement Co. The company protested, saying the Senate=20
didn't have such authority, but the Supreme Court sided with the Senate.=20

SACRAMENTO Three former workers at a Duke Energy plant moved from obscurity=20
into the national spotlight Friday as they became the first eyewitnesses to=20
provide sworn testimony accusing a generator of unethical -- and perhaps=20
illegal -- conduct in California's energy crisis.=20
Gov. Gray Davis called the men "heroes," and before the first witness even=20
completed his testimony, he invited them and their families to have breakfas=
t=20
with him Monday.
"If these allegations are true, it might be the smoking gun we thought=20
existed all along."=20
With 10 television crews and twice as many radio and print reporters=20
recording one of the most dramatic Capitol hearings in recent history, the=20
men spent six hours before a special Senate committee that is investigating=20
whether price-fixing and collusion among generators either fueled or created=
=20
the crisis.=20
The accounts of mechanics Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control- room=20
operator Jimmy Olkjer included accusations of equipment tampering at a Chula=
=20
Vista plant in order to withhold production and drive up electricity prices.=
=20
The testimony drew an immediate response. A consortium of power generators=20
labeled the hearing a "witch hunt" in a letter that reached committee=20
chairman Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, even before the last witness had=20
finished testifying. Dunn diverted briefly from the questioning to read the=20
letter aloud and then dismissed the charge as "nonsense."=20
Duke spokesman Tom Wil liams said the former employees' testimony should be=20
questioned because when Duke assembled its own team this spring, they were=20
not hired. "It's absolutely absurd," Williams said of the allegations.=20
But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente said he believes the accounts of the three men=20
are solid. He believes that Duke perhaps didn't hire them because they were=20
at the top of their pay scale, each of them working more than two decades in=
=20
the business.=20
"I think they provide clear evidence of tampering at the facility," said=20
Bustamente. "They have distinguished careers and service records and they ar=
e=20
coming forward as good Californians."=20
The testimony of the three men recounted much of the same information they=20
provided to The Orange County Register and CBS News on Thursday, but expande=
d=20
it and added a few revelations.=20
Dunn believes the most important testimony focused on a series of=20
control-room logs for three days in mid-January that show how frequently Duk=
e=20
ordered the "ramping up" and "ramping down" of their generators.=20
Johnson called it "yo-yoing" and said the charts on the generators that trac=
k=20
production levels started looking like "cardiac monitors" after Duke took=20
over the plant.=20
The significance of the constant ramping up and down is two-fold: It could b=
e=20
used as partial evidence to prove allegations that Duke manipulated its=20
production levels to drive up prices. And it backs up testimony from the=20
former employees that this behavior led to the erosion of good equipment,=20
causing further breakdowns and outages that would affect supply.=20
Duke officials said most of this ramping up and down was on orders of the=20
California Independent Systems Operator, which operates the state's power=20
grid, but they could not quantify what percentage of the decisions were thei=
r=20
own.=20
"This amount of ramping up and down is unusual," said Dunn. "There were=20
decisions made in three-, four-, five- minute intervals. I don't think that=20
kind of micromanagement comes from ISO."=20
The three men -- whom Duke had inherited from former plant operator San Dieg=
o=20
Gas & Electric -- said they were shut out of decision- making that led to th=
e=20
powering down of generators. But after a while, they said, they were able to=
=20
pick up on the longtime Duke employees' jargon and began to make their own=20
interpretations for the company's motives behind powering down.=20
"They would say they were `down for economics.' That was thrown around a=20
lot," said Johnson, who added that he came to believe it was done=20
deliberately to "reduce load to boast prices."=20
Again, Duke officials deny these allegations, saying they never powered down=
=20
generators to "game" the market.=20
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said the testimony convinced him that Duke=20
Energy is in violation of its lease with the San Diego Unified Port=20
Authority, which owns the plant.=20
The lease, which Peace read from during the hearing, requires that Duke use=20
"prudent utility practices" in its management of the plant - - something tha=
t=20
both Edwards and Johnson said was violated as routine maintenance was=20
abandoned and generators fell into disrepair.=20
If found in violation of the lease -- which the port authority is=20
investigating -- Duke presumably could lose control of the plant.=20
Williams said Duke has improved, rather than downgraded, the service record=20
of the plant.=20
On Thursday, the employees said in interviews with the Register that they=20
were ordered to fill Dumpsters with valuable new parts that were sold as=20
scrap metal. The parts were later needed to perform repairs, and since they=20
were not on hand, generators were not able to operate at full capacity.=20
Olkjer, the control-room operator, said he also noticed a correlation betwee=
n=20
Duke's decision to ramp down its generators and a precipitous rise in energy=
=20
prices. He believes that the Duke was able to influence prices by withholdin=
g=20
power.=20
"None of these allegations are true," said Williams. "Many of the parts were=
=20
obsolete, so we did clear them out ... we did nothing unethical."=20
Dunn said the next committee hearing, in mid-July, will provide power=20
generators with an opportunity to respond to allegations that they have=20
price-gouged Californians. He said that so far, three months after asking fo=
r=20
and then serving subpoenas for documents, the committee has received nothing=
=20
from the generators.=20
"They have also refused to agree to a non-destruct order for documents. We=20
want them to promise to not destroy documents, which could provide critical=20
evidence, and they will not do it," Dunn said adding that the contempt=20
charges are a possibility.=20
Dunn said if the committee finds evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it will=20
hand it over to Attorney General Bill Lockyer. If it finds evidence of=20
misconduct that shows the market is being wrongly manipulated, it will use=20
that information to push for system reforms and refunds for overcharges.=20

THE ENERGY CRISIS Power Debate Heats Up as Davis Reveals Contracts

SACRAMENTO -- After months of resisting disclosure, Gov. Gray Davis on Frida=
y=20

n=20
is deftly managing the energy crisis, but that critics warn contain clauses=20
and costs that may burden consumers with unpredictably high prices for years=
=2E=20
Provisions in some of the contracts protect generators from new state taxes,=
=20
shield them from potential action by federal regulators and give them a brea=
k=20
on environmental costs. At the same time, the documents are so heavily=20
censored in crucial areas that it is impossible to fully assess their impact=
=20
on the state and its residents.
State officials insist that the complex agreements, extending as much as 20=20
years and costing an estimated $43 billion, already have slowed the=20
hemorrhaging of state spending on power and sheltered consumers from wild=20
electricity price swings in the future.=20
"These provide a major building block for lifting this energy crisis," Davis=
'=20
top energy advisor, S. David Freeman, said as a 600-page stack of agreements=
=20
was made public in response to a court order. "That was our longer-term=20
strategy. We implemented it, and it's worked."=20
The governor, questioned after a public appearance at Mather Air Force Base,=
=20
echoed his advisor's optimism, but added: "I'm under no illusions. I think=20
the summer is going to be hot and the peak prices will spike up."=20
For months, Davis has publicly vilified the generators with whom his=20
administration has now become contractually bound. Asked whether his nemeses=
=20
negotiated in good faith, the governor said: "I do not think the generators=20
have our best interests at heart. . . . They're laughing all the way to the=20
bank. My job is to fight back."=20
Davis has a heavy political investment in the pacts, which the state began=20
negotiating in January as blackouts hit, power prices soared and the state's=
=20
large utilities slipped toward insolvency.=20
Crediting the contracts, Davis aides noted the state was paying an average o=
f=20
$332 a megawatt hour for power in January, but only $179 this month. The=20
contracts call for an average price of about $85 per megawatt hour over the=20
next five years and about $69 over the next 10 years.=20
Critics have noted that the state's current average costs under the contract=
s=20
exceed those now available on the daily market. But Davis contends the=20
current reduced prices are largely a result of his contracting strategy.=20
Partly because of the secrecy Davis imposed on the deals, they have become a=
=20
focal point of suspicion over his handling of the crisis. News=20
organizations--including The Times--and Republican officeholders sued to get=
=20
them. Consumer groups, meanwhile, complained about being hit with historic=20
utility rate increases for deals no one could examine.=20
The controversy seemed to intensify Friday, despite efforts by the governor'=
s=20
team to portray the agreements as a major tactical victory against=20
out-of-state power marketers who exploited the state's flawed deregulation=20
scheme.=20
GOP Leader Attacks 'Sweetheart Deals'=20
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, whose staff pored over the=
=20
documents, attacked the governor for brokering "sweetheart deals for the=20
generators."=20
Even a key Democrat, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove), expressed serious=
=20
concerns about a number of provisions in the deals that seem to offer specia=
l=20
relief to generators.=20
Some lawmakers and consumer groups pointed to provisions that would allow=20
generators to shift the cost of new taxes to the state and possibly exempt=20
the firms from a windfall profits tax.=20
"It ups the ante as far as the ultimate burden that the contracts will place=
=20
on the shoulders of California ratepayers and taxpayers," said Dunn, who is=20
heading a special committee investigating alleged manipulation of the state'=
s=20
energy market.=20
The senator said he also is concerned about provisions such as one negotiate=
d=20
with GWF Energy, which prevents the state from pressing any future claims=20
with federal regulators regarding the company's profits.=20

Freeman, who formerly headed Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power,=20

A number of energy insiders found reason to praise the contracts.=20

"This was California's problem to begin with," Foster said. "You don't want=20

About 60% to 70% of all the power that will be purchased in future years=20
under the contracts will be from new plants. The agreements, Freeman said,=20

By nurturing new plants, the state is signaling energy companies that "this=20

Budhraja, California's lead consultant in the bargaining.=20
But as analysts pored over the details, some challenged the governor's basic=

Michaels, who reviewed the contracts at The Times' request. "I am not=20
