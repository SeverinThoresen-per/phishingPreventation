Louise:

I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a c=
hance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you=
 in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.

Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, a=
nd encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I ca=
n help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and=
 Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I th=
ink you know, the development group is in the middle of several active trans=
actions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focus=
ed on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle in=
surance settlement finalized today).=20

I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapte=
r 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was =
with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (a=
fter having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed =
for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior com=
mercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating =
the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 proces=
s, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far great=
er magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly app=
licable.

Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my =
experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and ea=
ger to take on additional tasks.

With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are =
working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if ne=
ed be):

1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;
2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;
3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.

I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran=
=2E

Best regards,

Ben
