Hello Margaret,


I don't know if you remember but I gave you my and my husband's passports to=
 obtain H1b visas in Washington DC. You said that I have to fill out a coupl=
e of forms before they were send out. Does that sound right to you or did I =
understand it wrong?
Do you know how long it takes for the forms to be mailed? The reason I am as=
king this question is because I am afraid that the visa process will be dela=
yed and I have plans to travel in December. Without bothering you too much, =
can you explain to me the procedure. For example, Do I have to fill these tw=
o forms before the passports are mailed to DC or after. If I have to fill th=
ese forms before how can I speed up the process?

thank you,
Monika Causholli
