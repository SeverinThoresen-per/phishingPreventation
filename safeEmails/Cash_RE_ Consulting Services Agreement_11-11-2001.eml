I am happy for us to paper the deal.  I am not sure that we will be able to =
guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the asse=
ts -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that=
 requirement on the sale of the asset.  Michelle

Lizette, attached is the consultive service draft that Mike Vlaming @ scarth=
 lyons prepared and submitted. This agreement will be for the REF L.L.C.  Th=
is draft represents the compensation and recovery concerns that Scarth Lyons=
 have as a result of the early termination of 2 prior agreements with Enron =
development spvs. They loose out when Enron flips a deal and the successor t=
erminates.  Please review and let me know your views on the best way to proc=
eed.  Michelle has agreed that this is "just papering up a deal that is alre=
ady underway".  Once ready, I'll ask Michelle's support for the execution ap=
proval and I will let the commercial team know.  Thanks, Rj. =20
