I did some checking with the settlements group.  Our experience has
been that they pay what we bill and they struggle to bill us.  We have had=20
to sent payment detail numerous times.  They have a hard time applying cash
and have billed as late because of system problems.

Looks like an oppuntunity.

thanks

bob
