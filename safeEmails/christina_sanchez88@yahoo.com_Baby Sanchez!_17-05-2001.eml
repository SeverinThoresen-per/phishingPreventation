For those of you who haven't been graced by his
presence, here's a way to get a glimpse of my little
guy, Nicolas Paul Sanchez.

Go to www.womanshospital.com
Click on Web Babies
Choose May 9
Click Show the Babies
See Nicolas S.  (of course,they spelled his name
wrong).

Y'all can reach me at christina_sachez88@enron.com
while I'm on maternity leave.

Later!
