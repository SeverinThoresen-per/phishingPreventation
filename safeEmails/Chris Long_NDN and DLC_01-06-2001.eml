		 Subject: NDN Energy industry event


NDN is planning an energy industry breakfast for June 21st at the AGA.  We
have several Members of Congress on board and are pushing to get at least
one Senator.  There has been some debate on how to do this event.  We're
wavering between couching it as a NDN members only event (hence making it a
fundraiser) or we can open it to all energy companies (hence making it a
prospecting event.)  I thought I would run this by you and get your thoughts
on it.  Any feedback you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
