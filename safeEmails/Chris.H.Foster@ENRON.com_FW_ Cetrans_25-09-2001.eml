Lorenzo:

I apologize for our tardiness in getting back to you re: your generation pro=
ject in Baja. =20

Here is where we stand with the Centrans arrangement.

1.  I have spoken to Daniel R. Castagnola, a VP in Finance who has worked wi=
th Centrans and speaks highly of your business acumen in Central America.  T=
he transactions Enron has done with Centrans to date involve equity transact=
ions whereby any Enron credit exposure was hedged by assets.  So, the financ=
ial strength of Centrans was not directly in question.  Daniel indicated tha=
t we should look at Centrans independently to establish a transaction in Baj=
a.  To this end, we need financial statements from Centrans to establish cre=
dit parameters and prepare a Master Power purchase Agreement that could be u=
sed to conduct business. =20

2.  Stewart Rosman has contacted CFE re: transmission access in Baja.  CFE h=
as indicated that transmission is available.  We have never purchased transm=
ission in Mexico and although it might be possible to do so, we would prefer=
 if Centrans contracted for it themselves, delivering energy to Enron into t=
he ISO grid at Tijuana, which is an ISO tie-point.  I would expect transmiss=
ion on this arrangement would cost about $5/MWh.  =20

3.  Forward Prices - As you know, the longer term price at SP-15 for Peak is=
 about $36.  Off peak is about $24.  After subtracting the cost of transmiss=
ion, this nets about $30 for peak energy and $19 for off peak to the project=
 in Baja.  I am not sure what your fuel price would be, but it seems unlikel=
y that project economics would be supported by such a price.
Please contact me and let me know if you want to continue efforts to proceed=
 with this project.  If so, we need to obtain your financial statements to p=
roceed with the credit review and set up contracts with Centrans. =20
Thanks
