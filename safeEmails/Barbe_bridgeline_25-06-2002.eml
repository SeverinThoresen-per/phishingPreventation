I wanted to get an update on the Bridgeline gas.  Given our last conversatio=
n, I am assuming that you have done a deal with Bridgeline to buy the gas.  =
If not and if you are expecting me to sell the gas for July, then I need to =
know ASAP.  The window of opportunity to sell gas for July is almost shut. =20

I would appreciate an update.

Thanks
