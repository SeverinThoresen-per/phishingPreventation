John,
=20
We have developed a "morning briefing" for Gary Hickerson that includes prim=
arily views on the crude and products markets.  Recently, Gary has asked tha=
t we include a brief overview on Nat Gas in this packet.  We have worked wit=
h Chris Gaskill to get the morning briefing that he puts together for you an=
d your traders and find it very helpful.
=20
However, I am interested in going a step further and would like to talk with=
 you or one of your traders on a regular basis in order to get a more tradin=
g-centric view on this morning packet.  Specifically, I want to ask the ques=
tion, "What do you view as most important in this information" so we can dev=
elop our own "value added" information for Gary's group.
=20
Is there one of your traders who I might be able to meet with (after market =
close, of course) to discuss?
=20
Thanks, John.

Jeff
