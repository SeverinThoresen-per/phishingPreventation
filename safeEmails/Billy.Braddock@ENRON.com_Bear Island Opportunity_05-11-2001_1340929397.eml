As mentioned earlier, we have the opportunity to sell a 76MW, 7x24, fixed fo=
r floating financial swap to these guys for 5 years beginning 1/1/02.  They =
want offers from both the PJM-East and PJM-West Hubs.  In an effort to lower=
 the fixed price, they are willing to sell let us curtail during Monday-Frid=
ay for the term of the deal on an hour-ahead basis.  There can be a variety =
of call option structures, depending upon which gives them the largest premi=
um (options being number of hours which we can curtail each day).  Nick has =
begun working on valuing an at the money, 5x8 call (effectively an 8-hour cu=
rtailment), with hour-ahead notice.  Rob Benson is pricing the swap.  As soo=
n as we get the swap price (and the resulting strike price for the call), Ni=
ck can firm up his initial valuation and we can discuss with you.  =20
