Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams go=
ing to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project th=
at was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Willia=
ms and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was=
 obviously interested in speaking with you again. =20

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs fo=
r 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been s=
igned with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon =
committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years. =20

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil
