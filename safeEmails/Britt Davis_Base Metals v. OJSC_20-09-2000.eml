PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Dear Tim,

I have enjoyed speaking with you and Scott about the above-referenced=20
matter.  In those past conversations, I mentioned that I anticipated=20
transitioning in on behalf of Arthur, given the recent acquisition of the MG=
=20
Metals entities at issue in this case by Enron.  I have confirmed with=20
Arthur, who is employed by a MG Metals entity that was not acquired, that he=
=20
is happy to turn over the reins.  Martin has advised me that he is=20
comfortable if that is Arthur's decision.

Accordingly, please send all future communications in this matter to me=20
alone; I will take the responsibility for further dessimination within Enron=
=20
(and specifically for keeping Martin advised).=20

I do not know whether you have already sent a bill in this matter.  Enron=20
expects from its outside counsel itemized bills that list the names and=20
billing rates of all timekeeper, and an itemized list of expenses incurred. =
=20
If you have any question about how the bill should look, don't hesitate to=20
give me a call.

I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Britt Davis
