Gentlemen,

Looks like we are going to add a new generator to our program very soon.  We=
 will be the SC for Bay Environmental Management, hopefully starting on the =
July 3rd flow date.  They have 3mw in NP15, and their unit ID is NOVINV_1_RI=
CHMD.  I will keep you posted on the initial flow date.

Thanks,
Stan
