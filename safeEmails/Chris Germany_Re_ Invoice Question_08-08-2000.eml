This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.  According to my=20
notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel.  It was done as a physical fixed=20
price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for=
=20
April through August and 20,000 per month for September.

CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit=
=20
1 volumes.  So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a =20
price of IF CGAS + $.0075.

The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228.

Subject: Invoice Question


Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices th=
at
I don't recognize.  Perhaps you can help me understand what they are.   In=20
each
case, CES is invoiced for purchasing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Dth/month =
at
TCO pool at an IF TCO Appl index price.   The Sitara # for this transaction =
is
SA-226553.  Then, this same monthly volume is re-purchased by ENA at a fixed
price.  The Sitara # for the "buy-back" is SA-227738.

Do these transactions have something to do with the physical gas that we hav=
e
purchased from ENA for our retail customer retention activities?

Thanks.
