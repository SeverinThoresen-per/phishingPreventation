Sara:
We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. =20
You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was=20
limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the=20
advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up=20
with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated=20
memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).

Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should=20
be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about=20
this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take=20
care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the=20
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on=
=20
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon=20
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertaint=
y=20
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held=20
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exceptio=
n=20
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow u=
p=20
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter"=20
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this=20
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's=
=20
all the news for now.
=20
Talk to you soon.  Sara

P.S.  Can you send photos over the net?
