Thanks for the question  -  we are covered by language of the sub-lease.  Th=
ere there are standards for AEP's operation and AEP bears all costs/liabilit=
y associated with repairs or upgrades (if any).

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	Bammel Lease Question

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters=
 to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fac=
t that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the =
facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which =
would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a cha=
llenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reamin=
g 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility wit=
h the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could =
create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casin=
gs and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to ques=
tion the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspecti=
ve if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of =
watering out the outer wells and the facility itself. =20
