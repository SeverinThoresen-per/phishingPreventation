Vasant-

I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered=20
from the long flight back.

I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my=20
intentions here at Enron.

Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugge=
d=20
to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In=
=20
addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market o=
n=20
a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a=20
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how=20
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit=20
purposes.

These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for=20
which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines=20
elucidating the structure of the data.

I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.

With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has=20
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if=20
the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been=20
researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machin=
e=20
will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be=20
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is=20
Compaq-specific.

I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.

I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not=20
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the=20
other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there=
=20
wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In=20
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power=20
trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they wer=
e=20
ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they=
=20
have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also=
,=20
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses;=20
during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as t=
o=20
how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time=20
data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with "well, we=
=20
have it, but we haven't really tested it yet." An example is the weather: we=
=20
still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES=20
satellite.

My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only=20
if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the=
=20
Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the=20
areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the=20
Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few peopl=
e=20
at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't=20
directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers=
,=20
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.

As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecastin=
g=20
person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting t=
o=20
George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are=20
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their=
=20
traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with=
=20
Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were=
=20
disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They=20
also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid=20
on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all=20
work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but=20
merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years=
=20
as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a=20
state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me=20
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful,=20
including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to=
=20
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I=20
have learned here.

So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be=
=20
a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you=
=20
in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL=20
database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their=20
documentation.

As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday,=20
and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by=20
email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data=20
warehouse for floor trader support.

Clayton.
