We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Ga=
s=20
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I=
=20
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR=20
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone=20
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.
