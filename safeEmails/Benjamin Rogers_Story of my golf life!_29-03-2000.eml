 > I was still deep into my routine, seemingly impervious to the

 > Again the announcement, " Would the MAN on the WOMEN'S' tee kindly back
up

 >
 > I simply ignored the guy and kept concentrating, when once more he
 > yelled ut, "Would the man on the women's' tee back up to the men's tee,
 > PLEASE!!!"
 >
 > Finally, I stopped, turned, looked through the clubhouse window, directly
 > at the person with the microphone, and shouted back,
 >
 > "Would the person in the clubhouse kindly shut the f... up, and let me
 > play
 > my second shot?"
