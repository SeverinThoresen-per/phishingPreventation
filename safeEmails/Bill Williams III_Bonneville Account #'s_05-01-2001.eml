Group,

Last night we flowed energy out of the Alberta Power Pool.  We picked this=20
energy up at the BC border, used SNOPUD network to take it to Mid C, and sol=
d=20
it for a nice profit to WWP.  Congrats to Jesse and Guzman for getting it=20
done.
I have set up two accounts with BPA that might be of use to us in working=20
with Enron Canada regarding the Alberta Power Pool. =20
The first account is from the BC Border to Malin.  This account is non-firm=20
on the network and non-firm on the malin intertie.  It is the same type of=20
product we use from Hotsprings down to Malin.  The North-South account numbe=
r=20
is #682485.

I have also set up an account going South-North from the Caiso to BC Hydro a=
t=20
the BC border.  This is non-firm on the Malin intertie and non-firm on the=20
network.  This account will allow us to flow north from the southwest throug=
h=20
California and take energy to either PowerX or the power pool.  The=20
South-North account number is #682781.

Additionally, there has been concern over selling a non-firm transmission=20
contingent product.  Remember you can buy spinning reserves(call option) and=
=20
then sell that energy as firm if you would like.

If you have any questions please let me know.
Bill
