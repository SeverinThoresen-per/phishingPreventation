Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically=20
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting=20
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its=20
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is=20
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the=20
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated=20
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have=20
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee=20
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to=20
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not=20
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below=
=20
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold=20
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to=20
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities=20
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of=
=20
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with=
=20
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally=20
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute=
=20
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral=20
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and i=
f=20
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and=20
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the disput=
e=20
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after th=
e=20
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the=20
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned=
=20
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to=20
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could=20
resolve with your counterpart at DB.
