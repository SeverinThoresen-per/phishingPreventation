So the plan is to provide for a netting arrangement.  Even though you would =
handle the gas, EPMI would legally sell it to them so we could net this cost=
 with the power revenue we would receive and we have a significant L/C on th=
e power side.  Longer term if we cannot get approval for up 3 - 6 months thi=
s deal will not be good for us so we need to keep the pressure on credit. =20

I just talked to Jay and he doesn't want to do a long term deal with them.  =
I have a call in to the consultant.  Max Jay might agree to is 3 months.

Will advise as to any netting benefits we may get regarding gas/power deals =
with Smurfit.  For now, the gas team does not want to take on any incrementa=
l risk with Smurfit from the physical gas perspective.

We can still look at case-by-case physical power deals with EPMI given the c=
ollateral that we're holding.

Tracy,
	Talked to Tanya regarding the long deal for SSCC and relayed to her your su=
ggestion for handling gas.  She is ok with managing both gas and power throu=
gh EPMI as long as legal is on board and all necessary EPMI docs are in plac=
e or amended (netting, physical gas), and that we are comfortable with the r=
eceivables risk to SSCC.  She actually mentioned that there has been discuss=
ions about merging EPMI and ENA into one entity to more properly handle net =
positions, so she seems to like your idea. =20
	With that, I guess I'll pass this deal and legal relationship onto you unle=
ss you need or want me to help with any of this. =20

Thanks,
Max
