Tom, =09

I sat and read your letter and again my heart stopped beating.  My life too =
has changed forever.  I too will never be able to work HARD for a company be=
lieving that my best interest are being considered.  Lets all hope, pray, an=
d believe that one day, some day we are better, stronger people for having l=
earned such hard lessons.  I applaud you for your honesty.			=09

Sincere Regards,			=09
Sandra
