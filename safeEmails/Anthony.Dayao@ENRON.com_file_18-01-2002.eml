Sally,

You had mentioned in a voice mail that you have a spreadsheet that helps tra=
ck the assets that NewCo is looking at.
I would like to work off the same sheet for consistency.

Also, when you get the chance I'd like to sit down and discuss Dave's plan o=
f moving all the 'risk mgmt' team on the 31st=20
floor of ECN.

Regards,

--anthony
