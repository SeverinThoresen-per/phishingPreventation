I would suggest that we require a waiver before we pay the money. =20

Attached is the letter that I am planning to send to individuals who have ac=
cepted offers from the A&A program, but have not yet begun employment with u=
s.  I assume that no waiver of liability is needed, since an offer letter do=
es not incur liability.  Please review and let me know if this is adequate, =
or if some sort of waiver is needed as well.  Thanks.
