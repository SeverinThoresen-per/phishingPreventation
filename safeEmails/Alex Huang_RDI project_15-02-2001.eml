Cecil and David's code was correct but could not match Ken's spreadsheet
output due to a slight mis-specification in Ken's Excel spreadsheet. The cod=
e
was then modified to conform with Ken's specification and results very close
to that of Ken were obtained. As of now Ken's modifying his spreadsheet to
re-run the results, the original correct code will be restored, and we will=20
see what
happens then. Anyway this is rather encouraging.=20

Best,
Alex
