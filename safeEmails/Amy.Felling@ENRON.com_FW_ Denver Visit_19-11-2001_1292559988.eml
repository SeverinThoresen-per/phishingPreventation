I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  Amy Felling should be you=
r contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The Enron North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown =
Denver.
The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in =
order to sublease approximately half of that space.
We currently have 6 employees.
I believe that you have copied all of the Enron offices that I know of.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedul=
e a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking a=
t the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are foc=
using our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one=
 of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing I=
T back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on=
 you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in =
our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location,=
 which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiarie=
s or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or=
 can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this=
 matter.
