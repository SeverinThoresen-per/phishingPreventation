Dear Carlos:

Due to an electrical shortage at the Jennings Plant,
which shut the plant down, we are in a force majeure
situation effective immediately.  The plant expects to
be back up tomorrow, December 14.  We will advise you
tomorrow of the situation.

We are reducing our nomination to 0 effective today,
December 13.  The nomination was 1769.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.
