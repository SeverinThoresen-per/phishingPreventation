Rick,
The reports I am getting regarding you are quite encouraging.  Hope you cont=
inue to make progress without too much pain.  Don't talk unless you have to.=
  Could you imagine if I ever have that operation, there'd be blood everywhe=
re!

I do not have anything in particular that would compel me to make you talk. =
 It is good to hear that you will be back in the office, because I am concer=
ned that the Board stuff needs direction.  Not that people aren't working on=
 stuff, but your perspective is needed.  We had what I think was an excellen=
t meeting with Jeff Skilling - I chimed in by conference call.  He spent abo=
ut an hour and 1/2 with David, Cassandra and me.  Had some interesting persp=
ectives.  He did make the comment that, if he could get the same returns on =
incremental VaR, he would rather increase our limit to $250MM than do more o=
f those asset deals!!

Things are generally the same around here, there are some deals, but none th=
at would require you to step in.    Michael is trying to push to get some th=
ings closed in July because he is concerned that August will be dead.  It lo=
oks very likely that we are trying to dress up Encom for sale without making=
 big commitments.=20
There have been a few problems that may come across your radar scope - there=
 were some personell issues in the Henry Bath warehousing business that have=
 been dealt with and some personell changes in metals, basically a few peopl=
e let go in NY and London and a re-configuration of the commercial staff - m=
erging of physical and financial.
It seems to be moving on the right track from a control perspective.  It rem=
ains to be seen on the commercial front.  EBS has gotten gutted here.  I hav=
e spoken to Steve.  Apparently, he is going back soon, but he is in the fort=
unate state of having a few decent offers to weigh internally. He hasn't tol=
d me his final decision.

We have lost a 2 more people to resignation on the credit side - Anna Reich =
and Karolina Moran.  I would have liked to have kept Karolina but she has be=
en here 2 years and seems a little too bitter from the management changes an=
d the lack of substantive change to refresh herself.  Anna was going to have=
 to be replaced anyway.
On the positive side of the ledger, an ex-JP morgan ISDA Collateral Annex ex=
pert - Christine Stanchus - has joined yesterday, Pat Cini has been doing a =
good job, Rudi Z. plans to start on 8/15, Tracy Ngo is here looking around a=
nd thinking about early september, 3 from the outside have accepted and we h=
ave 4/5 other real prospects. There are also a few other internal transfers =
(one which we ought to discuss). We have reviewed hundreds of resumes, spoke=
n to tons of agencies, put in 2 newpaper adds and interviewed maybe a hundre=
d people.  Finally, we are starting to see some reasonable quality - a littl=
e more expensive, but much better.  Most hires/offers have been in the middl=
e range - sr. Specialist - junior director.  We need to fill in the other en=
ds of the spectrum.  It is possible that we have turned the corner....

I am hoping that when the days begin to get shorter (September 5th?), I will=
 be in a position to actually start to make an impact around here.

Take care and let me know if there is anything personal or professional that=
 I can do to reduce your stress.

Ted
