Louise,

I think the following is appropriate and I can get done:

Dyer:
Base - Same
Cash - $50
Equity - $150

Mcdonald:
Base - Same
Cash - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet:
Base - Same
Cash - $100
Equity - $250

I know these are at the top end.  For what it is worth, the other guys I got=
 done this year were not at the top end because I did not believe it was nec=
essary (Gilbert, Page, Etringer, Thome, Wehn).

If we can say done, the actual contract process can be slowed so that the eq=
uity is not set till the November meeting.  Also, if we get done, I wont bug=
 you anymore!
