There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think th=
e=20
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals=20
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to=20
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of=20
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. =20
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for=20
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was=20
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I=20
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I=20
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or=20
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.
