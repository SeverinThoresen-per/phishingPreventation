1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.

2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith=20
as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of thos=

Chris,

1-  According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I=20
+0.014.  However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032. =20
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2-  On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal=20
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement. =20
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turne=
d=20
physical.  Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES=20
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Vivien:  I have spoken with the EES scheduler on two CNGP deals and on the=20
40,281 volume (Sabine 702US) - this is a term deal that has always been=20
IF+.014.  It appears that ENA has changed the adder.  Please check as to why=
=20
this rate has changed.

Also on the CNGP deal where we (EES) has 186,180 at 3.406 - this is a=20
financial deal that was turned physical.  You may need to check with a Chris=
=20
Germany on both of these deals.  ENA doesn't even have this 186,180 entered.

Let me know.

THX
Patricia
