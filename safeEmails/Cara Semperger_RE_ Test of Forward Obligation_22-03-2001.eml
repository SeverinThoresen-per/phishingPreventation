     Every program has two parts - Windows executable which we write in Delp=
hi
    and database in Oracle. We need to run the stage version of the program
    against production data (database). The stage version of the program in=20
TestN
    and TestP is the same, the database (the data) is different.

     I think I will give you a call.

So, I don't use the version of the report that runs against production?  I=20
use stage?  Which one, Test P or Test N?

    Cara,

   Thanks a lot for the detail error report.
   Actually to me is enough to see the selection screen and the numbers of=20
the deals
   which are missing or are extra on the report.


   1) I can see that you are running the older version of the report, becaus=
e=20
there is selection
for Approval on the screen. Probably is our mistake. The shortcut does not=20
update the new
version. You need to run the STAGE Enpower launchpad with all the buttons at=
=20
first which
will copy the new version of Forward Obligation from the server to your loca=
l=20
computer
at first and then to run the shortcut.

  2) I run the newer version here, I can see the parts of the deals 503112=20
and 503107
which you have highlited and the region totals were zero's. You can verify i=
t.


 3) We just released a new version to stage, which should have the same=20
reasults, but we
did some optimizations, we intend to reduce the speed soon.
The version number is 3.0.0.36, you can see it when you run the report or=20
click Help-About.
Until you don't see that number there is no use to continue testing, on any=20
problem
call David Poston


    Thanks,
    Kroum

Good Morning,

I ran the new report against production, using the shortcut provided for me.=
=20
My results are innacurate because some transmission deals are not showing.=20
The strange thing is that there is no real pattern as to why some=20
transmission deals show and some don't.

I compared the forward ob to scheduling.   You might want to do that=20
comparison for yourself there.  Also, checking the Real-Time position manage=
r=20
as well will help.

Please see this power point document.
