    Rick,

Beautiful. =20

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating pr=
ejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's p=
rejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tan=
gi and you did on our post-hearing briefs. =20

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of perf=
ormance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when th=
e panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never "accepted" the meters=
=2E  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of=
 this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their an=
d your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at nigh=
t, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency bas=
is, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with =
your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It =
was my great pleasure to have partnered with you on this.

Britt=20

Britt,

We have done a thorough analysis of ONEOK's calculation of pre-judgment inte=
rest and are in agreement with their amount due Northern of ($56,097.69). =20

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to No=
rthern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars for =
the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calcula=
tion of the accumulated interest.  Since this is a dollar-valued OBA, each m=
onth's imbalance was valued at the appropriate monthly index price and a 6% =
simple interest calculation was applied from that month until the current pe=
riod.  We had a significant amount of monthly imbalances due Northern early =
in the review period that carried forward very large credit interest balance=
s due us.  For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG valued at (=
$753,541.27).  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 997 days (Se=
ptember 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amount due NNG=
 of ($123,498.19).  For comparison purposes, contrasting with this month is =
a large debit imbalance due ONEOK of $769,407.44 for the month of December 2=
000.  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 113 days (Februa=
ry 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amount due ONEOK of =
$14,292.01.  By summarizing these two months, we have an imbalance value tha=
t is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net interest valuation due=
 Northern of ($109,206.18).  This scenario plays out for the entire review p=
eriod netting to a cumulative credit amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).

If you would like to review the calculations in detail, please let me know a=
nd I will forward the spreadsheet to you.

Rick, Harry & Tangie

	Harry,

	We need your help yet one more time.  Tomorrow morning I will have hand-del=
ivered to you a letter from Ben Singletary, ONEOK's attorney, stating that t=
hey calculate pre-judgment interest (using Northern's methodology, which the=
 arbitrators specifically approved--thanks again to you, Tangi and Rick!) su=
ch that ONEOK actually owes Northern about $50,000.  We certainly don't mind=
 them owing us $50,000; however, we want to see if ONEOK owes us even more t=
han that. =20

	If you need additional information (such as the actual panel award), please=
 call Becky Zikes and she will make sure a copy gets to you.  I will be out =
from about 9:30 to 3:00 tomorrow, but will be in later in the day.

	Many thanks.

	Britt
