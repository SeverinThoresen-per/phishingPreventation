I want to clarify the problem. In researching the problem I found that the r=
ate retrieved for PnR was slightly higher than the rate retrieved for FDD Ov=
errun. In our discussions with Bill Anderson, we focused  on how this impact=
ed the contract he asked us to review. Bottom line is in storage allocations=
, the LSP -Whitewater overrun activity should have received a greater portio=
n of the available injection capacity.
The IT group is correcting the problem. The 7.61 cent PnR rate will be hard =
coded in the allocation program this afternoon as interim fix until the prop=
er system modifications are ready.  =20

Hello,

Mike Bodnar and I called Bill Anderson at US Energy today regarding his comp=
laints about the storage allocation process.  Bill has claimed that LS Power=
 is being allocated down to zero on days when he should be receiving a pro-r=
ata share of the overrun injections on any given day throughout the summer. =
=20

Mike found out that LS Power - Whitewater was being incorrectly allocated do=
wn to zero on certain days throughout the summer due to the system pointing =
to an incorrect (discounted) overrun rate for the storage account of LS Powe=
r - Whitewater.  LS Power was being charged the full, non-discounted overrun=
 rate on their FDD contract. =20

US Energy will undoubtedly want to negotiate a settlement of some sort, sinc=
e they believe this has been an issue since 6/1/01.  =20

I believe we need to do the following:

1 - Determine if the other LS Power plant (Cottage Grove) was also affected =
by this system error.
2 - Determine the date that the incorrect rate took affect.
3 - Determine how LS Power overrun injections throughout this summer were af=
fected by this, since 6/1/01.
4 - Determine a fair and equitable solution to this issue (as of 6/1/01) to =
present to the customer within three weeks.

I will set up a video meeting as soon as possible with regards to this issue=
=2E
