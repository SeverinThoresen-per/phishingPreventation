Ben Jacoby told me that the state of Tenn. (through an Energy Policy Committ=
ee) has implemented a moratorium on the state reviewing air permits and siti=
ng on new IPPs.  Apparently TVA is exempt from the moratorium.  He heard tha=
t TVA has been telling the govenor's office that all the new IPPs coming on =
line in Tenn. are putting TVA's transmission resource at jeopardy.  If this =
is being said, it is incorrect because, per TVA's "procedures", TVA conducts=
 an interconnection study before connection, so TVA actually approves the in=
terconnection, plus TVA would not let the IPP purchase transmission (or woul=
d cut its transmission).

Enron's proposed plant in Tenn. already has the air permit, so Ben is not as=
 concerned about Enron's plants.  However, this type of behavior could show =
that TVA may be simply keeping IPPs off its system (even though presumably t=
hey would pay it revenue -- same problems that we continue to have with VIUs=
).  Could this be helpful in messaging somehow to DOE, etc. that TVA should =
be in an RTO?
