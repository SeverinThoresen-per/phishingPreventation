Enron Slashes Profits Since 1997 by 20% --- Partnership Dealings Cited As Dy=
negy Talks Go On; Debt Ratings an Issue

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 b=
y $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings=
 with partnerships run by some company officers.=20
The disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, ca=
me even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks wit=
h rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner,=
 is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people =
familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced b=
y whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.
The total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, ba=
rely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of e=
ven two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading=
 yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of t=
heir 52-week high of $84.875.=20
On the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energ=
y-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal reg=
ulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion f=
or past power purchases.=20
In yesterday's SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported=
 assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the thr=
ee-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off=
 shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the=
 company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion.=20
The filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer=
, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, =
in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited p=
artnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't asso=
ciated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why t=
he the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be =
reached to comment.=20
The SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the natio=
n's biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, =
Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief fi=
nancial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC in=
vestigation.=20
The SEC filing raises further questions about Enron's accounting procedures =
and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors an=
d analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies do=
wngraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for f=
urther downgrades.=20
Ralph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn't predict what ef=
fect the SEC filing would have on Enron's credit rating, but he added that t=
he document contained damaging disclosures. "It's bad," he said.=20
The Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside =
auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company's annual financial =
statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting princip=
als. Because of all the accounting adjustments "the audit reports covering t=
he year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon," y=
esterday's SEC filing said.=20
An Andersen spokesman called Enron's restatement announcement "an unfortunat=
e situation" but said the accounting firm is "cooperating with the company .=
 . . to bring resolution to these matters." He said he couldn't comment furt=
her because of client-confidentiality concerns.=20
Among the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for =
two partnerships connected to Michael=20
Kopper, a former managing director of the company's North America unit. The =
two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or J=
EDI, and Chewco Investments LP.=20
As reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was for=
med in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the h=
uge California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers.=20
In 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers' interest for $383 mi=
llion and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost=
 all the money for Chewco's purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed =
financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron.=20
By having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron=
 treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions o=
f dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges =
that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been cons=
olidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396=
 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing =
said.=20
Mr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn't return a =
phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed.=20
Enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings wi=
th a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2=
000 net income by $103 million.=20
LJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP,=
 were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, =
who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and=
 Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership docum=
ents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his =
interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has decl=
ined to be interviewed.=20
Several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restateme=
nts were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also =
pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said "it is possible" that cont=
inuing Enron reviews will "identify additional or different information conc=
erning these matters."=20
As such, "there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the c=
loset," said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis.=20
The Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnin=
gs of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transa=
ctions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pr=
etax charge in this year's third quarter due to the termination of deals wit=
h several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow r=
eceived more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships.=20
--- Mea Culpa

In the midst of talks to be acquired by Dynegy, Enron details
accounting and other actions.

-- Will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third
quarter of 2001, reducing previously reported income by $586 million

included in its consolidated financial statements, based on generally
accepted accounting principles

-- Fires Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina
Mordaunt, managing director and general counsel of an Enron division

-- Establishes a special committee to review all transactions

Does Enron Trust Its New Numbers? It Doesn't Act Like It
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/09/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

YOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch =
what we do.''=20
That excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should=
 have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, Pr=
esident Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.
Enron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow inv=
estors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange t=
ransactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of som=
e of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most impor=
tant ones remains a mystery.=20
But the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street an=
alysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, whi=
ch leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules.=20
In January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls i=
ts pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company'=
s share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made.=20
Remarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restate=
ment raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enr=
on appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six=
 times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little=
?=20
The answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable me=
asures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unco=
nsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not=
 be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and inves=
tors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fra=
ction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeov=
er. Takeunder would be a better term.=20
What set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron =
says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year i=
n error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so =
it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the redu=
ction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 mil=
lion, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that =
Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chie=
f financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears the=
y may not have been so bad.=20
But that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate th=
at perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings wit=
h the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules,=
 but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are.=20
In fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that m=
ay be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting =
issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fas=
tow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ''Big Energy C=
orporation'' where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades wi=
th another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whet=
her a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the l=
osses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron.=20
Such games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquire=
d because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.

Surest Steps, Not the Swiftest, Are Propelling Dynegy Past Enron
By NEELA BANERJEE

The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare.=20
Until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks, the Enron Cor=
poration and Dynegy Inc. were rivals within the new, rapidly evolving deregu=
lated power industry. Each embodied a sharply different approach to making m=
oney, attracting investors and winning over regulators.
Enron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely u=
ntested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the=
 acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of=
 its murky accounting.=20
Dynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefu=
lly gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy's steady=
 progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibi=
llion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor.=20
As one senior energy industry executive said, ''Enron's trying to hit more t=
riples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.''=20
Kenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from=
 two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends includ=
e President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy's chairma=
n and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well res=
pected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy tra=
ding and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine=
 months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the=
 mid-80's.=20
When electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the comp=
anies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily gene=
rated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good de=
als on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. En=
ron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power =
plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the=
 actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot o=
f money very fast.=20
Dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier =
of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuc=
k to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operat=
ions, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most=
 of which have gone badly awry.=20
Mr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power pla=
nt acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced. ''We need a l=
ittle bit everywhere,'' he said. ''Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy i=
s more of a physical player.''=20
If Enron's finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If =
Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. E=
nron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept thi=
ngs quiet and discreet.=20
''Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,'' said Christopher R. Ellin=
ghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst.=20
Because Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analys=
ts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creat=
ive accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. =
Watson to gloat about his company's new, larger stature. Enron may have been=
 less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear =
who will take on that role now.=20
''Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,'' said Andre Mea=
de, head of Commerzbank Securities' United States utility research. ''It see=
med to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron,=
 go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with le=
ss money and make it work.''

Enron Admits to Overstating Profits by About $600 Million
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

11/09/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from=
 its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dyn=
egy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to=
 the merger talks said.=20
Worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed ann=
ouncement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a de=
al -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron's share price to fal=
l. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading=
 operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by=
 Enron's financial distress, steered business elsewhere.
The boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a=
 deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or =
roughly $10 a share.=20
The deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTex=
aco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1=
 billion.=20
The sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives,=
 is whether Enron's credit rating will be reduced to ''junk'' status by the =
major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron's disclosures and its plan=
 to be acquired by Dynegy.=20
Dynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dyneg=
y-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Se=
rvice for an ''expedited review'' of the transaction.=20
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a b=
igger cash infusion to buoy Enron's credit rating -- now just two notches fr=
om falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the cur=
rent deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or tw=
o, the executives said.=20
The executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would a=
llow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced.=20
Shares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether b=
uyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms o=
f revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron's latest disclosures would=
 lead to the deal's being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to =
$36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the d=
eal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than =
a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valu=
ed at nearly $70 billion.=20
In a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net inc=
ome for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on=
 its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated=
 that part of last year's reported profits came from transactions with partn=
erships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company's chief financia=
l officer until he was ousted Oct. 24.=20
Enron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.=
C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The com=
pany also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of =
its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships.=20
Any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energ=
y regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in th=
e still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Amo=
ng the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, =
the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.=20
Some analysts expressed hope that Enron's financial straits would encourage =
regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospec=
t of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation's dominant energy-tra=
ding company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher=
 proportions in some important regional markets.=20
''If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-=
Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,'' said Christophe=
r R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital. ''However, the effective in=
dustry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some l=
eniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by=
 the F.E.R.C.''=20
It was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal. ''If Dynegy an=
d Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dyneg=
y would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in =
itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,'' said Ray=
mond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independe=
nt natural gas producers, based in Houston.=20
Mr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal. '=
'The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power t=
hat has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threaten=
ing North American gas producers.''=20
Enron's restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduce=
d it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported prof=
its so far this year by $5 million.=20
The changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partn=
erships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi an=
d Chewco, after characters in the ''Star Wars'' movies -- and of including a=
 subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another call=
ed LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow.=20
The remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 thr=
ough 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustmen=
ts and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously rec=
ommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the audi=
tors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges we=
re not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a s=
pecial board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transa=
ctions.=20
''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Art=
hur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Is=
sues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial sta=
tements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial =
statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its=
 special committee to bring resolution to these matters.''=20
While the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two part=
nerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partners=
hip or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how tho=
se partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities =
whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors.=20
Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for=
 comment, his lawyer said.=20
Enron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on O=
ct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company s=
aid its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though w=
rite-offs led to a net loss.=20
In a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned t=
hat the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it cl=
osed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days,=
 that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the co=
mpany had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the e=
arnings statement.=20
But Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, =
with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made i=
n 2000 and early this year.=20
Enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM par=
tnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properl=
y implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the co=
mpany said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director o=
f enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche.=
=20
The company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partners=
hips, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. =
Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another emp=

Dynegy Halts Talks With Enron, Awaits Credit Rating (Update1)

Dynegy Halts Talks With Enron, Awaits Credit Rating (Update1)

     (Adds European share trading in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc.'s plan to buy
rival energy trader Enron Corp. has stalled pending a credit
review by Moody's Investors Service, people familiar with the
talks said. Dynegy will probably walk away if Enron receives a
``junk'' credit rating, the people said.

     The proposed takeover, for about $8 billion in stock, hit a
snag because of the threat of a downgrade that would trigger a
cash crisis by forcing Enron to repay $3.3 billion of bonds early.
Moody's and Standard & Poor's are considering lowering their
ratings, which are two levels above junk.

     A rating below investment-grade would make it ``difficult if
not impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper their
ability to trade,'' Jefferies & Co. energy analyst Paul Fremont
said. Fremont doesn't have a rating on Enron's stock or bonds.

     Enron shares slid 39 cents to $8.02 in Germany. Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer declined to comment. Dynegy spokesman John
Souza declined to comment on the possibility of a downgrade by
Moody's. Souza said talks with Enron on an acquisition were
continuing.

     Bankers are lobbying Moody's to make a quick decision so an
acquisition could proceed, according to the people. Moody's
analyst Stephen Moore cut the company's rating to ``Baa2'' on Oct.
29, the second reduction in less than two weeks.

     At that time, Moore said he would be ``tracking very closely
their wholesale volumes'' of energy trading. ``That will be the
leading indicator of where the company is going.''

                           Lower Rating

     A reduction of Enron's credit rating after the company
restated earnings to reduce net income by more than $500 million
during the past 4 1/2 years will make it tougher to maintain
trading relationships, said competitors and investors.

     Without an investment-quality rating, Enron would have to
post collateral for trades, making it more difficult to do
business, said Michael Morrell, president of the trading arm of
Allegheny Energy Inc., a Maryland utility owner. ``It would be
true for us, and I would think for many others,'' he said.

     Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, has
moved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, such
as the Intercontinental Exchange, a venture formed in March 2000
with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Mirant spokesman James Peters said.

     The earnings restatement may also justify a credit downgrade,
said Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the
Harris Insight Equity Fund. ``This shows the company was run
scandalously,'' he said.

     Investor concern is reflected in the decline in Enron's 7.88
percent notes that mature in 2003 in the past month. The notes,
which were unchanged yesterday at 77 cents on the dollar, now
yield about 27 percent. The debt was trading near 100 last month.

                             Lawsuits

     An acquisition of Enron would make Dynegy the biggest energy
trader and a leader in managing energy needs for commercial and
small-industrial customers. The combined 2000 revenue of the two
companies is $130 billion.

     Dynegy also would inherit shareholder lawsuits over the
partnerships, and some troubled assets, including Enron's 65
percent stake in the $3 billion Dabhol Power Co. in India, owed
$64 million by India's Maharashtra state, said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade.

     ``You buy a lot of fleas when you buy Enron,'' said Meade,
who rates Enron ``accumulate'' and owns no shares. Dynegy may be
content to hire away traders and build its own business, he said.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy,
is considering adding $1.5 billion to the transaction to help
Enron.

     Dynegy shares rose $3.50 to $36.50 yesterday.

Enron adds up 4 years of errors=20
Energy giant restates finances to account for lost $600 million=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Ever have to fix an error in your checkbook when you get your monthly bank s=
tatement in the mail?=20
Imagine the headache Enron Corp. is facing. On Thursday, the company admitte=
d it's found a few errors, too -- close to $600 million in mistakes spread o=
ver the past 4 1/2 years.=20
The energy giant said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to ac=
count for losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including seve=
ral under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This incl=
udes a $586 million reduction in net income, an additional $2.5 billion in d=
ebt and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share.=20
Enron also said it has fired a number of employees who invested directly in =
the partnerships and is investigating if others had improper dealings.=20
The announcements came on the same day the company confirmed it was in negot=
iations to merge with cross-street rival Dynegy Corp. Directors with both co=
mpanies have been in round-the-clock meetings in recent days, hammering out =
a deal.=20
The revelations, outlined in a document Enron filed with the SEC Thursday mo=
rning, shine a bit of light onto issues that for weeks have been cloaked in =
shadows and out of sight of Wall Street analysts and investors.=20
That includes investment partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion loss for th=
e company last quarter, as well as other deals formed by the company's forme=
r chief financial officer that may have been a conflict of interest.=20
The company's reluctance to share detailed information on the partnerships s=
ince they first arose last month left many to assume the worst. Enron's stoc=
k price plummeted, credit agencies slashed its ratings and trading partners =
began to shop their business around to competitors.=20
Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the release of information was aimed to c=
alm the concerns of shareholders and federal investigators. For all practica=
l purposes it came too late.=20
"At the end of the day these details give support to the fear that Enron was=
 a financial house of cards," said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morri=
s Harris. "It would make a good case study on what happens when you fly too =
close to the sun."=20
The turmoil started shortly after Oct. 16, when steep losses in Enron's thir=
d-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnershi=
ps created by former CFO Andy Fastow with the approval of the company's boar=
d of directors.=20
The partnerships, called LJM1 and LJM2, were formed using Enron equity and o=
utside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the c=
ompany's new lines of business, such as Internet broadband trading and water=
=2E They were also designed to help the company grow quickly without adding =
too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock.=20
Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and managing director of the entities were =
a cause for concern for Wall Street because it would put him on both sides o=
f some of the deals, representing both the buyers and sellers simultaneously=
=2E The company said it was careful to assure there were no conflicts of int=
erest, but under pressure from investors Fastow resigned from those partners=
hips last summer.=20
Fastow earned as much as $30 million through his role with the partnerships,=
 while a number of other Enron employees also invested in them personally.=20
Two of those employees -- Ben Glisan, a managing director and treasurer of E=
nron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and general counsel o=
f an Enron division -- were terminated by Enron this week. The other employe=
es, including Fastow and executives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeag=
er, no longer work for Enron.=20
While the transactions themselves do not appear to have been illegal, the wa=
y some of them were recorded in Enron's financial statements led to the corr=
ections.=20
Specifically, Enron said that special entities it created named Chewco Inves=
tments L.P. and Joint Energy Development Investments L.P. should have been c=
onsolidated back onto its books in November 1997. The LJM1 partnership shoul=
d have been consolidated into the company's financial statements in 1999.=20
While Fastow is credited with creating the strategy behind the complex finan=
cing deals, observers say the plans were reviewed and approved by Enron's bo=
ard of directors and other officers.=20
The results of all the deals and how they were recorded on the company's fin=
ancial statements had to go through the office of Chief Accounting Officer R=
ichard Causey and through Enron's accounting firm, Andersen.=20
"You couldn't slip these things by anyone," Olson said. "They're simply too =
big, and too many people were involved for it to go unnoticed."=20
Thursday's filing details some of the complex financing deals between Enron =
and LJM1 and LJM2.=20
Enron formed LJM1 and LJM2 in 1999 with infusions of its own cash and stock.=
 Other investors, such as pension funds and banks, also invested millions of=
 dollars more into the partnerships. These investors included Credit Suisse =
First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, amo=
ng others. Fastow was managing partner of both entities.=20
The idea behind LJM1 and LJM2 was for them to become sources of capital to b=
uy assets from Enron, co-invest with Enron in certain projects and to take e=
quity stakes in other companies to spread the risk of those businesses. Betw=
een June 1999 and September 2001 Enron and Enron-affiliated entities did 24 =
deals with LJM1 or LJM2 or both, ranging from buying and selling hard assets=
, purchasing debt or equity interests, and selling the rights to buy or sell=
 shares of stock at certain preset prices.=20
While Enron provided descriptions of the many deals on Thursday, their compl=
exity can be mind-numbing for anyone who isn't an accountant.=20
For example, in June 2000, LJM2 purchased fiber-optic cable from Enron that =
was installed yet unused for $30 million in cash and $70 million in an inter=
est-bearing note, or IOU. LJM2 sold some of that fiber to other companies fo=
r $40 million, but since Enron helped market the fiber to those buyers it re=
ceived an "agency fee" of $20.3 million.=20
In December 2000, LJM2 sold the remaining fiber for $113 million to a specia=
l entity that Enron created strictly for the purpose of that purchase. LJM2 =
then used some of the proceeds from the sale to pay off the $70 million Enro=
n IOU.=20
As if the transaction weren't complicated enough, Enron then signed a contra=
ct with one of the investors of the entity that paid $113 million for the fi=
ber to help cushion that investor from any potential losses.=20
The transactions were completely legal and earned LJM2 $2.4 million and redu=
ced Enron's credit risk on the transaction by $9 million. The fact that the =
earnings rely so heavily on business between such closely related entities i=
s disturbing, however.=20
"These intra-company transaction were totally exotic," Olson said.=20
Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst with Willams Capital in New York, said th=
e revelations have made many "very alert to the shenanigans at Enron."=20
"Enron just likes to be fancy," he said. "They may have been too fancy for t=
heir own good."=20

Enron, Dynegy still talking merger=20
Smaller energy trader's shares up; analysts see it poised to profit=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Merger discussions between Dynegy and Enron Corp. continued Thursday as Wall=
 Street had a mixed reaction to a possible combination of the two Houston en=
ergy traders.=20
Investors traded up Dynegy's shares, while several stock analysts raised que=
stions.=20
Sources told the Chronicle Wednesday that the two companies were in advanced=
 talks for the smaller Dynegy to buy out its troubled rival. A stock deal li=
kely to be worth $7 billion to $8 billion was being discussed.=20
In addition, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, cou=
ld give Enron an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion to help stabilize its fi=
nances and keep its core trading business running smoothly.=20
Dynegy, the people said, was offering a modest premium over Enron's stock pr=
ice, but Enron had been pressing for a higher offer.=20
Shares in Enron closed at $9.67 Tuesday, $9.05 Wednesday and $8.41 Thursday.=
=20
Each company issued a statement Thursday saying the two were in discussions =
about "a possible business combination." Neither plans additional comments u=
ntil a deal is struck or the talks fail.=20
The statements came as Enron said it is restating its finances as far back a=
s 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it crea=
ted, including several being investigated by federal securities regulators.=20
Enron has been under heavy fire since Oct. 16, when it released third-quarte=
r earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships forme=
rly run by its since-replaced chief financial officer.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, is to meet wi=
th top Dynegy executives today.=20
She has a number of questions about a possible merger, including why Dynegy =
wants to buy Enron when its best resource, its people, could cross the stree=
t and turn in r=E9sum=E9s.=20
She also wonders why Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, is appar=
ently willing to sell Enron at such a low price.=20
"What does he know that we don't know?" Coale asked.=20
But Coale also got the sense Dynegy executives are doing their homework and =
moving with caution, which she said is positive.=20
A Dynegy buyout of Enron has the potential to be "highly accretive" to Dyneg=
y's bottom line depending on the price paid, said Ronald Barone, an analyst =
at UBS Warburg in New York.=20
"The new company would be a global powerhouse," he said. "There are signific=
ant synergies that can be realized to enhance value."=20
Shares in Dynegy closed up $3.50 Thursday to $36.50.=20
Investors liked two opposite prospects, said Jeff Dietert, an analyst with S=
immons & Co. International in Houston.=20
On the one hand, investors see potential for Dynegy to add profits by buying=
 Enron, he said. But if no deal happens, they also see a chance for Dynegy t=
o take business away from a weakened Enron.=20
He expects any deal Dynegy signs to give it an escape if the Securities and =
Exchange Commission should conclude Enron acted illegally.=20
Government regulators would have to review a merger, looking to see if too m=
uch market concentration would result.=20
With a merger, Dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the =
North American natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent, =
said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Harris Morris in Houston.=20
For electricity, Dynegy's numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 =
percent, he said.=20
Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York, doesn't bel=
ieve regulators would find a market concentration problem.=20
"It's a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition," he said.=
=20
Meade called an Enron-Dynegy merger "a mixed bag," as it would let Dynegy cu=
t costs and lead the energy trading market.=20
"However, I don't think it's as easy as it sounds," he said, adding that a s=
uccessful merger would take the correct incentives to convince Enron's trade=
rs to work for the new company.=20
"Whenever you merge with or buy a human-capital-based business, it's risky."=

Do the sustained bear raids on Enron Corp. portend chaotic conditions in the=
 energy markets? That is the $64-billion question. Bearish stock markets are=
 the indispensable scavengers of capitalism. They clean up the financial and=
 economic landscape and kill off disease-carrying pests. True believers in f=
ree markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of mi=
sbehaviour has fouled the financial environment.=20
Those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technolog=
y bear market may have been too complacent. In recent weeks, the biggest los=
er on the New York Stock Exchange has not been a tech stock, but Enron, a co=
mponent of the Dow Jones utilities index. Enron's high was $89.06 a share, a=
nd as recently as August it was trading at $45. In recent weeks, Enron's sha=
res have plunged, closing last week below $12.33 That collapse has sent shoc=
k waves through the capital markets. What may be even more significant for e=
nergy producers and users is the valuation of Enron's bonds: they are tradin=
g at distressed prices, offering yields comparable to junk bonds. The rating=
s services have turned highly negative on Enron, although they still rate it=
 an investment-grade credit.=20
(I regret -- oh how I regret! -- that I must disclose before proceeding furt=
her that investment funds I manage have, at this writing, exposure to Enron =
stock, acquired at prices substantially above current markets.)=20
For Canadians unfamiliar with Enron and its place in U.S. energy markets, he=
re is an introduction: Voltaire summed up the entire 18th- century deistic p=
roof of the existence of God by saying, "If God did not exist, it would be n=
ecessary to invent him." It's the same with Enron. U.S. energy markets neede=
d a prime mover. Prior to Enron, these markets (other than crude oil) were r=
elatively primitive and inefficient. Neither producers nor consumers had mea=
ns to hedge their risks effectively, and long-term contracts were made -- if=
 at all -- under circumstances of grossly inadequate information.=20
The futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable, and no futures=
 market for electricity existed. Enter Enron. In the past half- dozen years,=
 Enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world. Its willin=
gness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the=
 markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers rel=
iable hedging and financing opportunities, day in, day out.=20
By putting its own capital on the line to make trades, Enron created depth, =
liquidity and transparency in energy markets. So active were those markets t=
hat they gave price signals to all who would follow them. Conspicuous among =
those who didn't were the policy-makers in California. Had Gov. Gray Davis a=
nd his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures, they =
would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the Gol=
den State. Instead, they let a crisis develop, and then locked in long-term =
purchase contracts at all-time record-high prices just before they collapsed=
 to normal levels.=20
By some estimates, Enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all o=
utstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity. Since these con=
tracts extend years ahead, and since the other parties to those trades are r=
elying on Enron's ability to cover its obligations, the risks to energy pric=
es and supplies could be enormous if Enron were to default.=20
That still seems extremely improbable. Contracts executed through the public=
 futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for Enron'=
s "counterparties" (the term for the other side of a futures contract). But =
Enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protectio=
n.=20
What has hammered Enron's securities lately is the unfolding story of gigant=
ic off-balance-sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included,=
 astonishingly enough, the chief financial officer, who was finally forced t=
o go on leave. These partnership deals were never really disclosed, except i=
n obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the de=
als or that a senior company officer was involved.=20
Why should investors who aren't owners of Enron stock or bonds care? Because=
 the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity pr=
ices in history, and some observers wonder whether Enron's internal problems=
 exacerbated those swings. Worse, if Enron has to withdraw from the markets,=
 what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and con=
sumers have in place? Many U.S. energy producers locked in high prices by ma=
king huge forward sales. If those contracts are voided, defaults could sprea=
d through the system, throwing energy markets into chaos.=20
There were enough problems in the energy-short U.S. even when Enron was keep=
ing the markets functioning. If the master market maker goes down, or is for=
ced to curtail its operations, this winter could be a truly chilling experie=
nce for North Americans. When Bush and Cheney aren't worrying about bin Lade=
n or anthrax, they may be worrying about Enron.=20

ENRON IN CRISIS - Restated figures show how earnings were cut.
By ROBERT CLOW.

ENRON IN CRISIS - Restated figures show how earnings were cut - SEC FILING -=
 Energy trading group admits that several of its special-purpose entities sh=
ould have been consolidated on the balance sheet.=20
Enron yesterday marked four years of earnings down sharply after taking acco=
unt of off-balance-sheet dealings.
The company admitted that several of its off-balance-sheet, special-purpose =
entities should have been consolidated on its balance sheet.=20
The effect of the change was to reduce earnings substantially in each year f=
rom 1997 to 2000; from $105m to $9m in 1997, from $703m to $590m in 1998, fr=
om $893m to $643m in 1999 and from $979m to $847m in 2000.=20
This year's earnings were marginally increased but the company's third-quart=
er loss widened marginally from $618m to $635m.=20
In the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron also announced the d=
ismissal of two more officials: Ben Glisan, the company's treasurer, and Kri=
stina Mordaunt, general counsel for one division.=20
Enron ran into trouble on October 16, when it announced a $1.2bn reduction o=
f shareholders' equity and a $1.01bn charge.=20
Yesterday's filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about. En=
ron attributed the charge to dealings with LJM, a private equity fund run by=
 Andrew Fastow, formerly Enron chief financial officer.=20
Private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnin=
gs of companies, such as JP Morgan Chase. Keeping LJM off the balance sheet =
allowed Enron to avoid major swings. But to prevent LJM being consolidated, =
Enron had to own less than half of the special-purpose vehicle, and for outs=
ide investors to participate they had to be compensated.=20
What that meant was that when the value of Enron's private equity investment=
s fell below a certain level, people familiar with Enron's balance sheet sai=
d, co-investors would receive Enron stock.=20
The Enron filing reveals that the LJM losses arose from another group of spe=
cial-purpose entities, known as the Raptor vehicles, which were designed in =
part to hedge an Enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company, Rhythm Ne=
tConnections.=20
The $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity arose from the termination of t=
he Raptor hedging arrangements, which if they had continued would have resul=
ted in Enron issuing 58m shares to offset the company's private equity losse=
s.=20
Enron also revealed that Mr Fastow was paid in excess of $30m as a result of=
 his role in running LJM.=20
At issue is whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of other Enro=
n shareholders.=20
The filing also raises questions about Enron's cash flow, which will be stud=
ied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors.=20
A group of banks, including Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deuts=
che Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have lent more than $4bn to Enron o=
ver the last weeks, much of it not collateralised.=20
By reducing its earnings by more than $100m for several years, Enron has cre=
ated concern about its ability to service debt. On the balance sheet, Enron =
owes $12.8bn. Off-balance-sheet entities related to Enron owe $8bn-$9bn. Enr=
on generates about $3bn cashflow annually, but despite claiming to be cashfl=
ow-positive, its borrowings rose significantly last year.=20

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
TheStreet.com
11/09/2001 07:09 AM EST
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003700.html>

1. Mangia, Mangia! Er -- Scratch That=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission has suspended trading in 2DoTrade (TD=
OT.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary) , doubting the company's claim that it is =
prepared to distribute a disinfectant for anthrax. No wonder the agency is s=
keptical: Biotechnology seems a bit far afield from 2DoTrade's goal of devel=
oping a business-to-business platform for the African continent.=20
It's even farther removed from the company's original mission: According to =
a report filed with the SEC, it wanted to start a chain of full-service, whi=
te-tablecloth Italian restaurants "based on authentic Italian regional recip=
es." That plan was abandoned last spring.=20
In the meantime, it still has no revenue. 2DoTrade says it has cumulative lo=
sses of $29,000 because it's still in the development stage. A report on its=
 Web site suggests the stock is "an exceptional ground-floor opportunity [fo=
r the] investor with vision." But the SEC has publicly questioned the compan=
y's prospects, the existence of its alleged contracts, and the identity of i=
ts managers.=20
2. Treasury Department At It Again
Chalk up one more blunder for the Treasury Department. In the current fiasco=
, the SEC has said it's investigating the early release of news that the Tre=
asury Department would stop selling 30-year bonds.=20
The Treasury apparently screwed up on two counts: Not only did it allow the =
news to leak out early through a third party (a consultant who attended a de=
partment briefing without press credentials), but it also posted the informa=
tion on its own Web site before it was publicly announced. So it can't simpl=
y blame the premature disclosure on someone else's bad judgment.=20
Disclosure of the mistake is sure to further annoy bond traders, who were al=
ready piqued that the government had given no hint at the policy shift. Acco=
rding to press reports, many bond trading desks suffered big losses because =
they were caught unawares.=20
3. It Doth Protest Too Much
Hewlett-Packard's (HWP:NYSE - news - commentary) affirmation of "enthusiasti=
c support" this week for the merger with Compaq (CPQ:NYSE - news - commentar=
y) rings a bit hollow, given that H-P's stock has seen double-digit losses s=
ince the merger was announced.=20
The board's recent frozen-smile commentary came on news that some of the com=
pany's most influential investors, members of the Hewlett and Packard famili=
es, oppose the deal and will vote against the merger if given the chance. Th=
e move by H-P heirs was all the more damaging because they control a large c=
hunk of stock: According to press reports, the Hewletts own over 5%, while a=
n institute affiliated with the Packard family holds more than 1%.=20
Even before the family members weighed in, investor disapproval of the merge=
r was manifest. As TSC has reported, stocks of both companies have dropped s=
harply after the deal was announced, slicing $6 billion off the deal's initi=
al value of $25 billion.=20
But after news that the Hewlett family would oppose the deal, cheered invest=
ors bid up H-P 17% in just one day.=20
It's not often that the board of a company and its investors are at loggerhe=
ads -- and regarding the board's mood, we're reckoning panic might be more a=
ccurate than enthusiasm.=20
4. NYSE Lagging In Surveillance
Two years after the NYSE was embroiled in an illegal trading scandal, oversi=
ght of floor brokers is still too lax, according to government regulators.=20
Their report, released to members of a congressional committee in September,=
 was made public this week. It says the Big Board has made "significant prog=
ress" in regulating brokers, but deficiencies remain: Among other things, th=
e NYSE needs to improve surveillance of floor members, ensuring that regulat=
ors are on the trading floor to watch for potential violations.=20
In 1999, nine brokers pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to schemes =
in which they took a share of trading profits. At least 64 brokers took part=
 in profit-sharing arrangements until 1998, according to the SEC.=20
No doubt the NYSE's regulatory improvements are commendable -- just hope it =
doesn't take another two years for the exchange to get its practices complet=
ely up to par.=20
5. Enron, Once Again
Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) to shareholders: "Heyyyyyy, guys? You k=
now all those financial statements we've been giving you for the last five y=
ears? Uhh ... they were totally wrong. Sorry."=20
Yes, just when it seems Enron has exhausted its considerable reserves of dum=
b things, the company surprises and produces yet another. This time Enron an=
nounced it would restate earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 20=
01. "Financial statements for these periods ... should not be relied upon," =
the company said, in a statement likely to obliterate any lingering vestiges=
 of credibility.=20
The adjustments to its financial statements reduced profits over the period =
by a total of over a half-billion dollars, while the accounting changes magi=
cally produced an additional $2.59 billion in debt.=20
The announcement comes amid reports that Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentar=
y) is in talks to buy Enron. With Enron's stock down about 90% from a year a=
go, at least it's likely to be cheap -- though it would be a stretch to call=
 it a bargain under these circumstances.=20


GLOBAL INVESTING - Shareholder-friendly companies outperform STUDY FINDS GIV=
ING MORE POWER TO INVESTORS ...
By ALISON BEARD.

GLOBAL INVESTING - Shareholder-friendly companies outperform STUDY FINDS GIV=
ING MORE POWER TO INVESTORS HAS PRODUCED BETTER RETURNS THAN PROTECTING MANA=
GEMENT.=20
Companies that protected management rights with poison pills, classified boa=
rds and other anti-takeover tools significantly underperformed businesses th=
at gave more power to shareholders through the 1990s, according to a new stu=
dy.
A survey of 1,500 companies found that those with the most pro-management pr=
ovisions generated annual returns that were 8.5 per cent less than companies=
 that favoured outside investors.=20
"There are broad variations across companies as to whether they are democrac=
ies or dictatorships," said Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Whart=
on School of Business, who wrote the study with Paul Gompers and Joy Ishii o=
f Harvard University. "What we found was that the democracies did better."=20
After the takeover craze of the 1980s, companies scrambled to enact provisio=
ns that would help executives defend against corporate raiders.=20
Typical provisions included poison pills, which allow all pro-management sha=
reholders to buy stock at discounts during takeover attempts diluting the po=
wer of the hostile bidder; super-majority votes, which require from 66 to 85=
 per cent approval for a management change rather than a majority; golden pa=
rachutes, which give large compensation packages to executives who are fired=
 or demoted; and classified boards, whereby board members' terms are stagger=
ed, preventing them from all being ousted at the same time.=20
The stock market downturn and well publicised cases of corporate mismanageme=
nt, including this month's Enron controversy, have made investors increasing=
ly wary of such pro-management stances.=20
Last week, California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest US pen=
sion fund, won its fight to declassify the board of Metromedia International=
 Group, the emerging markets communications company.=20
This week the fund is discussing Enron. Other investors in the energy mercha=
nt have already filed law suits against company officials, alleging fraud an=
d seeking to recover their lost share value, estimated at $20bn over the las=
t month.=20
Hewlett-Packard shareholders were also asserting their rights this week. The=
 Hewlett family, which still holds a 5 per cent stake in the computer compan=
y, announced it would oppose management's plan to merge with Compaq.=20
Mr Metrick's study lists HP as one of the most shareholder-friendly companie=
s in 1990 among the 1,500 he evaluated. Companies were given one point for e=
very by-law that reduced shareholder rights. Aside from HP, those with the l=
owest scores - or highest level of shareholder power - were IBM, Wal-Mart, D=
uPont, PepsiCo, American International Group, Southern Company, Berkshire Ha=
thaway, Commonwealth Edison, and Texas Utilities.=20
The companies with the highest - or most pro-management - scores in 1990 inc=
luded GTE, Waste Management, General Re, The Limited, NCR, Kmart, United Tel=
ecommunications, Time Warner, Rorer and Woolworth.=20
=46rom 1990 to 1999, the first group outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 =
by 3.5 percentage points each year from 1990 to 1999, the second group trail=
ed the index by about 5 points. An investor who bought the pro-shareholder s=
tocks and sold short the pro-management stocks could have captured that 8.5 =
per cent difference.=20
The study also found that the pro-management companies had lower sales growt=
h and less profits than other firms in their industry.=20
However, Mr Metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation. Stron=
g management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance, nor =
do shareholder rights always lead to better returns.=20
"What we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better =
than those that didn't in the 1990s ... so maybe if the companies that don't=
 give shareholder rights gave them, their stock would do a lot better going =
forward," he said. "Maybe investors should be looking for that change. But t=
hat is the question the paper doesn't answer."=20

GLOBAL INVESTING - Putting a value on a group under siege.
By JOHN DIZARD.

11/09/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Risk arbitrageurs, the people who bet on the price and likelihood of mergers=
 and acquisitions taking place, need nerves of bomb disposal experts. They n=
eed to know more than the public about deals and potential deals that usuall=
y attract a lot of interest from the media and other analysts, which means g=
etting an edge is harder than with non-deal stocks.=20
The planned acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is a case in point. The deal is "=
subject to" the usual conditions - the SEC, antitrust authorities and, of co=
urse, the due diligence work on the valuation of the underlying assets and b=
usinesses. But buying Enron stock in the hope that the valuation will turn o=
ut to be above the present price may be a slightly ambitious strategy for ev=
en the most well informed investors.
The book value of the company is supposed to be about $11bn, which would be =
a couple of bucks higher than the current stock price. And the ultimate purc=
hase price should - repeat, should, not must - be above that book value. How=
ever, in any company where the financial managers of a week ago are not only=
 on the street but under invest-igation, you have to wonder if a "take-under=
" at a low stock price is a possibility.=20
Nevertheless, all the panic had spread from the febrile world of equities to=
 the normally less excitable one of bonds, which has created a much lower ri=
sk opp-ortunity. For example, the Enron 7 7/8 per cent bonds of 2003 were tr=
ading yesterday with bids in the high 60s and offers in the low 70s. That re=
presents a yield to maturity of 22 per cent - not bad for 18-month paper.=20
The question of the underlying value in Enron comes down to two risks: the c=
ontingent liabilities from the widely discussed off-balance-sheet vehicles t=
hat it used to swap assets for financings, and the safety of the trading acc=
ounts. The off-balance-sheet companies have already been combed over and the=
ir effects on the parent balance sheet restated, with the results reported y=
esterday. The contingent commitments do not affect the value of the assets b=
acking Enron's debt.=20
Analysing the trading books is more problematic. Rating agencies have not lo=
oked at the specific transactions that make them up; rather they have depend=
ed on ensuring that Enron's risk managers are capable and organisationally i=
ndependent of the traders they supervise. The agencies also looked over the =
risk management and valuation methodology and have found that it is the stan=
dard package for trading firms.=20
The problem is that Enron's business is not the standard trading business. A=
ll conventional methodology, such as the various value-at-risk systems, or J=
P Morgan's Riskmetrics, assumes liquid, continuous markets, where it is poss=
ible to measure historic price volatility and implied price volatility. But =
the over-the-counter gas and electricity markets that are Enron's core busin=
ess involve long-term contracts, lumpy regional sub-markets, and unstable vo=
latility measures. As one top Wall Street derivatives manager says "These re=
quire scenario analyses rather than VAR."=20
The valuation problem is complicated by Enron's gigantic market share, far l=
arger than the largest institutions have in the government bond, currency, o=
r exchange traded commodities markets.=20
Even so, it is likely that Enron's long and short positions do balance, as t=
he company says, even though the revenue recognition and profitability may n=
eed tuning. The company's earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassur=
ing, in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income stateme=
nt in the trading business. Dynegy's due diligence team and the Arthur Ander=
son auditors working on Enron's books know they had better get it right.=20
If Dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock dea=
l, you could have wondered whether they saw value in Enron as a going concer=
n. That means keeping the trading business going, although probably running =
it more carefully and transparently. Also, this is probably a "once in a cor=
porate lifetime" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companie=
s with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators. There was no chanc=
e that the Federal Reserve or any other government entity would or could ste=
p in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets. Th=
e Fed's giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low-cost way to head =
off any problem.=20
And Enron's pipelines, gas storage business, power plants, liquefied natural=
 gas facilities, and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate. =
They would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bon=
dholders have first call.=20
So Enron's $13bn of debt is most likely a good buy, and you are getting it a=
t close to bankruptcy prices. It is probably a good idea to leave the bet on=
 the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs.=20

ENRON IN CRISIS - Lure of number-one spot sparks interest.
By JULIE EARLE and ANDREW EDGECLIFFE-JOHNSON.

11/09/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's interest in Enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its H=
ouston-based neighbour's position as the number-one natural gas and power ma=
rketer in the US.=20
"The potential is staggering. If the companies combined, they would create a=
 $21bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy-marketing ski=
lls and financial resources," says Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Wil=
liams Capital Group.
Dynegy's gas business is currently less than half the size of Enron's, and a=
lso trails Duke and Mirant. It is only one-eighth as big as Enron in power t=
rading, where AEP, Mirant, Duke, El Paso and Reliant also hold big positions=
=2E=20
Like Enron, Dynegy has been a market favourite, exploiting growth opportunit=
ies in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and elec=
tricity markets in the US.=20
It has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a UK=
 presence.=20
Dynegy's online trading platform, DynegyDirect - which helped raise the comp=
any's recent third-quarter earnings 22 per cent to $286m - is seen as a good=
 fit with Enron OnLine. The two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale g=
as liquids at the click of a mouse.=20
There are other links. Chuck Watson, Dynegy chief executive, is a friend of =
Jeff Skilling, who quit as Enron chief executive officer in August. Dynegy i=
s also an important trading partner for Enron, demonstrated by the fact that=
 Enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading=
 losses.=20
That counterparty relationship may give Dynegy a powerful incentive to prese=
rve Enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets. Analysts say=
 there would be a big shake-up in the energy markets were Enron to fail, alt=
hough some say the volatility may be only short term. A takeover would not b=
e the only way for rivals such as Dynegy to capitalise on Enron's weakness, =
however. Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy are already assessing potential opp=
ortunities to pick up Enron's share of the market should it disappear. Many =
are trading partners with Enron, and some, like Aquila, have been reducing t=
heir exposure as counterparties as the Enron crisis deepens.=20
However, any Dynegy takeover of Enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny=
=2E Most analysts believe a deal could be done, but approval could take more=
 than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies.=20
Some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail-out for the=
 trading industry, and therefore welcomed by the Federal Trade Commission an=
d the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
Others, however, raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by Dyne=
gy. Although Dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitio=
ns or mergers in the US and overseas, they had not expected such a transform=
ing deal. Mr Watson told analysts in October that he was considering deals w=
hich could add generation assets, gas pipeline and storage infrastructure, e=
ntire utilities and communication assets.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, says there would be other =
concerns surrounding any deal with Enron.=20
"Strategically and culturally, the companies do not fit well together," she =
says, adding that Enron has been moving to offload units while Dynegy has pr=
eferred to hang on to assets.=20
Carol Levenson at Gimme Credit.com, an independent provider of credit resear=
ch, says Dynegy would be taking "a big risk" to its credit ratings by even b=
eing associated with Enron's liabilities: "Dynegy is utterly dependent on it=
s credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners t=
o do business profitably."=20
Analysts took some comfort, however, in the possible involvement of the newl=
y merged ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 per cent stake in Dynegy. Additional=

ENRON IN CRISIS - Rivals steady the Enron ship.
By JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/09/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

ENRON IN CRISIS - Rivals steady the Enron ship - COMPETITORS - Fears over pr=
ice and disruption lay behind caution.=20
Enron's competitors refrained from taking advantage of its weakness to steal=
 its business after the leading US energy trader started to come under press=
ure last month.
Enron acts as principal in 25 per cent of trades in those markets. It also d=
elivers commodities - and financial and risk management services worldwide -=
 while operating the largest web-based transaction system.=20
"A lot of entities have dealt with them for a long time and have a lot of ex=
posure to them," says Philip Kassin of PwC Consulting. "Any major negative c=
onsequence to Enron would affect both physical commodities prices for electr=
icity and gas as well as have a negative affect on financial energy products=
=2E"=20
Enron's demise would not only hurt the thousands with exposure to the group =
through its trading operations; it would also would have a spill-over effect=
 on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector.=20
The 50 to 100 large counter-parties that do business with Enron daily could =
continue to trade without the market's biggest participant and even its trad=
ing platform; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business. =
But without Enron, a liquidity crisis would probably ensue, disrupting energ=
y markets and undermining business for many of its competitors.=20
"There's a fair amount of incentive for counter-parties to hang in there and=
 not contribute directly into pushing (Enron) over the brink," says Christin=
e Uspenski, energy analyst at Schwab Capital Markets.=20
So the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surel=
y become a riskier market. They have continued to do business with Enron on =
much the same terms they had before October 16, when Enron disclosed a surpr=
ise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long-simmering questio=
ns about its transparency.=20
Analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions. After all,=
 with the launch of Enron's online platform in 1999, trading volumes had soa=
red as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2,000,=
 ranging from weather derivatives to coal. Enron's revenue more than doubled=
 to $101bn from 1999 to 2000.=20
Many admitted they were unsure how Enron made its money. Not only had the co=
mpany so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company=
 but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder t=
o scrutinise Enron's finances.=20
"It became a new age holding company," says Paul Kedrosky, who teaches strat=
egy and corporate governance at the University of British Columbia. "As long=
 as the company performed, people were willing to forgive what was obviously=
 horrific disclosure."=20
Those people included not only share market investors but also those in the =
business of buying and selling energy commodities. They needed goods and Enr=
on delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else, often at bet=
ter prices. It was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient genera=
tion facilities to keep the lights on for their customers.=20
They would go to the open market and purchase electricity, much of the time =
from Enron. Those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities =
obtained that through the open market as well. Many have locked themselves i=
nto long-term contracts with Enron that they cannot get out of - and they wo=
uld be the ones with most to lose if Enron went under.=20
But those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business witho=
ut Enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that Enron=
 will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past.=20
Analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable=
 throughout Enron's troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased. =
"No one knows their positions or how they're hedged in the market, or how th=
ey might have to cover their positions," one energy trader said yesterday.=20
Even though Enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets=
 to their current state of sophistication, it has been forced over the past =
few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer.=20
However, analysts say some of Enron's partners in the US and Europe are dema=
nding Enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that ca=
n be called on quickly.=20
Enron's main competitors are now able offer better prices, and - while still=
 not openly seeking to undermine Enron - are undercutting its business as th=
ey report new customers and higher volumes. But, so far, no major counter-pa=
rty has changed its terms with the company. "Out of respect for Enron's pres=
ence, my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the dou=
bt to see if they can resolve this situation," says Michael Zimmer, of law f=
irm Baker & McKenzie. See Lex.=20

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Enron rescue deal talks drag on - US ener=
gy group forced to restate accounts since 1997.=20
Enron, the US energy group, was yesterday forced to restate its accounts sin=
ce 1997 as it scrambled to prevent its confidence crisis turning into financ=
ial meltdown.
Expectations of an early announcement of a rescue deal between Enron and Dyn=
egy, a rival group, were dashed as talks dragged on through yesterday mornin=
g in Houston.=20
Enron said it was terminating the employment of its treasurer and the genera=
l counsel of one of its divisions, both of whom, it said, were involved in l=
imited partnerships that conducted off-balance-sheet deals with Enron.=20
Enron, a stock market star until this year, is fighting to restore the confi=
dence of investors, creditors, customers and regulators following last month=
's ill-explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $1.2bn ( #820m) to=
 meet off-balance-sheet obligations.=20
It tried to clarify the situation yesterday by laying out the accounting bas=
is for the shareholder equity reduction and providing more information about=
 the limited partnerships formed by Andy Fastow, Enron's former chief financ=
ial officer.=20
Enron said it believed Mr Fastow, who was replaced last month, had received =
"in excess of $30m" relating to his management and investment activities in =
the partnerships.=20
The group said it and its auditors had also decided some off-balance entitie=
s should have been included in its prior financial statements.=20
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number o=
f the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC (Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission) about these matters," said Ken Lay, Enron's ch=
airman and chief executive, yesterday, adding that the group would continue =
to respond to investors' requests for information.=20
The group's banks, due to meet today, want to secure $3.3bn in unsecured cre=
dit lines drawn down in the past month. But they may not be able to renegoti=
ate the terms unless Enron's situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a def=
ault. JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which have made $1bn in secured loans t=
o Enron, are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk, a=
s nervousness increases.=20
In a regulatory filing, Enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the=
 third quarter of this year, leading to an increase of $628m in debt for the=
 year 2000, and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year.=20
Enron's stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $8.61 - and =
stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year. The group's b=
onds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism abou=
t a rescue deal with Dynegy. Lex, Page 22 Enron in crisis, Page 27.=20

Enron=20
Enron has provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with some more det=
ail on concerns it had raised over the last three weeks, while the stock has=
 declined 70 per cent. The $1.2bn equity charge relates to losses in LJM, th=
e off-balance sheet private equity fund run by Andrew Fastow, its former chi=
ef financial officer. These, in turn, arise from a group of special purpose =
entities that LJM used to hedge risk associated with Enron's investment in a=
 bankrupt broadband company. The charges resulted when the hedges were close=
d. All clear, then?
What emerges from the filing is an off-balance sheet mess of interlinking fi=
nancing vehicles. The difficulty in unravelling it might be part of the reas=
on why JP Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney insisted that their last loa=
n should be secured with assets. No doubt other lenders would like similar s=
ecurity. More clearly, Enron admits that three unconsolidated entities shoul=
d have been consolidated. That means the earnings statements over the last f=
ive years were worthless. Enron has now reduced net income by a cumulative $=
600m for 1997-2000, not the kind of thing that reassures ratings agencies. M=
r Fastow's resignation will leave him with more time to spend with the $30m =
he received for running the LJM partnerships.=20
It is hardly surprising that talks with Dynegy about a capital injection hav=
e dragged on. Would it really be wise for Dynegy to take on risk that remain=
s very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy? Enron migh=
t look cheap, but the stock has collapsed for good reason.=20

Energy trading giant Enron Corp. disclosed yesterday that it had overstated =
its earnings by $567 million since 1997, and it fired two more company offic=
ials as questions continued to be raised over how much further the company's=
 free fall may go.=20
Enron's stock has plummeted and energy companies have avoided doing business=
 with it since Enron disclosed last month that its obligations to several pa=
rtnerships involving company officials had reduced its shareholders' equity =
by $1.2 billion. Enron is facing a cash crunch, analysts said. Its credit ra=
ting has been slashed and if it falls to junk-bond status, the company would=
 have to make accelerated payments on $3.4 billion in debt held by the partn=
erships.
As Enron made its disclosures yesterday, Dynegy Inc., Enron's smaller Housto=
n-based competitor, continued to study a possible $8 billion acquisition of =
Enron.=20
A rescue by Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., a major Dynegy shareholder, coul=
d provide Enron with $1.2 billion in cash, according to sources familiar wit=
h the negotiations. Dynegy also would take on $12.8 billion in Enron debt, t=
he sources said.=20
Enron, the nation's largest trader of electric power and natural gas, said e=
arnings from 1997 through the first six months of this year should have tota=
led $2.9 billion, not the $3.5 billion that it had declared. Enron blamed th=
e reduction on investment losses in private partnerships that it says were n=
ot properly accounted for.=20
It also fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and a division general counsel, saying it=
 believed they had made personal investments in some of these partnerships, =
whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations by shareholder=
s against senior Enron officials and board members.=20
The new disclosures were made to the Securities and Exchange Commission, whi=
ch is investigating the partnerships. They also were published on Enron's We=
b site.=20
The firings follow Enron's dismissal of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fasto=
w, who until July had also directed some of the largest of these partnership=
s with the approval of Enron's board. Enron said Fastow made more than $30 m=
illion from two of these partnerships.=20
Using capital from Enron and private investors, the partnerships purchased p=
ower plants and other assets from Enron with the intention of selling them, =
a key to Enron's corporate strategy of concentrating on trading energy rathe=
r than producing it.=20
Dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with Enron about an acquisit=
ion, but did not comment further. Industry analysts believe that Dynegy is d=
riving a hard bargain, seeking protection against the possibility of further=
 disclosures of financial problems by Enron, and against the growing number =
of lawsuits by Enron shareholders. Dynegy "has the chips," said Brian Youngb=
erg, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.=20
Another possible outcome could be a major investment in Enron by Dynegy and =
potentially other energy companies, if the right collateral can be found, so=
urces said.=20
One question is whether a Dynegy acquisition of Enron would face a drawn-out=
 regulatory and antitrust review that could block Enron's chances of recover=
ing.=20
"Dynegy and Enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading spa=
ce. It's a great concentration of power," said Raymond Plank, chairman of Ap=
ache Corp., a Houston natural gas producer. "We don't see any advantage to t=
hat."=20
If the Dynegy deal is approved, the purchase price would come to just over $=
10 per share, based on current market values. In August 2000, Enron's stock =
hit $90 a share, but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummete=
d in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed. E=
nron's stock closed yesterday at $8.41, down 64 cents.=20
Enron handles about one-quarter of all energy trades, quoting prices and buy=
ing and selling commodities. While some of these transactions set the price =
of oil, natural gas, electricity other energy products, far more commonly th=
e trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices, o=
r companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases.=20
Energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability=
 if Enron were to fail.=20
"The inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms =
length from Enron now," said Louis B. Gagliardi, an analyst with John S. Her=
old Inc.=20
Plank said traders "have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact=
 of a potential failure on Enron's part. We were able to get out of almost e=
very trade [involving Enron]. "Not everyone has been able to do it." But Pla=
nk said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks.=20
"Markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas, power and oil" if Enron ha=
d to pull back from trading, Gagliardi said. "But we'd get back to normal pr=
etty quickly."=20
Bond-rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on Enron's bonds since =
these disclosures, and its debt is now one step above junk status, by some r=
atings.=20
Analysts said that if Enron's bond rating fell below investment grade, they =
expect it to set in motion a forced sale of Enron assets held by the partner=
ships.=20
Two of the partnerships, named Marlin and Osprey, have a combined indebtedne=
ss of $3.4 billion, said Ralph Pellechia, an analyst at Fitch Inc., a bond-r=
ating firm. That debt is to investors who purchased assets from Enron, inclu=
ding a water system in Britain and other holdings.=20
If Enron's bond rating crashes, the assets presumably would be sold and Enro=
n would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by deliveri=
ng its stock to the partnerships, Pellechia said. Given the drop in Enron's =
stock price, that might not be possible.=20
"We don't believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at =
this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt," he said.=20
"Obviously there are a lot of options they [Enron officials] are exploring. =
We are watching it very closely."

Enron Restatements Don't Go Far Enough

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) still hasn't come clean on the shadowy =
deals that led to many of the company's problems.=20
The battered power giant restated more than three years' worth of financials=
 Thursday because previous numbers failed to take into account complex deals=
 with a number of affiliated entities. As a result of the restatements, annu=
al recurring earnings in the 1997-2000 period are now 10% to 25% lower than =
originally reported.=20
However, the picture could be even worse. The restatements of recurring earn=
ings left out nearly $1 billion of losses suffered by a related entity calle=
d LJM2 in 2000 and 2001. Losses suffered by a similarly structured entity ca=
lled LJM1 were factored into the restatement, while LJM2's were not. Enron d=
idn't comment, but the press release detailing the restatements appears to a=
rgue that LJM1 was too thinly capitalized and, as such, it should always hav=
e been consolidated in Enron's core numbers. The inference, therefore, is th=
at LJM2 losses weren't included because the entity was better capitalized th=
an LJM1.=20
But that explanation isn't holding water in many quarters. In fact, the excl=
usion of LJM2 could be a source of further controversy for Enron. Enron fell=
 64 cents Thursday to $8.41.=20
Pulling a Fastow?
LJM2 has received much scrutiny in recent weeks, and is primarily responsibl=
e for events that have cratered Enron stock. The entity was led by Enron's n=
ow-ousted CFO Andrew Fastow, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is l=
ooking at the transactions Enron did with LJM2. In addition, these transacti=
ons prompted a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron's equity in the third quarter=
=2E Among investors in LJM2 were Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, Gener=
al Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, according to recent reports in T=
he Wall Street Journal.=20
It appears from other public documents that LJM2 could not have entered the =
deals that led to the losses if Enron had not agreed to issue $1.2 billion o=
f stock. If so, the LJM2 deals weren't as arms length as Enron might want to=
 project right now.=20
Therefore, to get a truer picture of Enron's profitability, investors should=
 factor the LJM2-related losses into restated numbers. The result isn't pret=
ty: The $1 billion of LJM2-related losses would've reduced the restated recu=
rring earnings for 2000 and 2001 by some 30%. True, a portion of these losse=
s were included in October's initial release of third-quarter financials, bu=
t they were taken as a charge that Enron asked investors to leave out of the=
 recurring profits number that is supposed to give investors a view of core =
earnings power.=20
As a result of the restatements made Thursday, Enron said 2000 recurring ear=
nings per share was $1.33, compared with the originally reported $1.47. But =
if the $501 million of LJM2-related losses were included, Enron only made 88=
 cents in 2000. If the $453 of losses were included in profits calculation f=
or the first nine months of 2001, Enron actually made 98 cents per share, in=
stead of the restated $1.36.=20
What is the basis for including these LJM2 losses when Enron doesn't? Well, =
Enron says in the Thursday press release that LJM1 was consolidated into the=
 restatement "because of inadequate capitalization." It later says that it b=
elieves that initial capital commitments for LJM1 totaled $16 million, where=
as the "aggregate capital commitments to LJM2 were $394 million."=20
Trimming the Hedges
The LJM2 number is certainly larger, but in and of itself the equity number =
means little when you look at sheer size of the deals LJM2 and Enron did tog=
ether.=20
Enron asked LJM2 for protection against swings in the value of broadband and=
 other assets. These so-called hedging deals were struck through specially-f=
ormed entities collectively known as Raptor, according to Thursday's press r=
elease. Through the Raptor deals, LJM2 agreed to make Enron whole for losses=
 sustained if the assets declined in value, and it hoped to profit if these =
assets went up in value. Enron SEC filings show that the notional value of t=
hese Raptor hedges was a sizable $2.1 billion.=20
However, to make hedges of this size, Raptor would've needed adequate cushio=
n against potential losses. The value of the equity LJM2 put into Raptor has=
n't been disclosed. But it appears Enron took a radical step to give Raptor =
the cushion it needed. Enron seemingly created assets for Raptor to make it =
big enough to handle the hedges. From what can be pieced together from Enron=
 disclosure, the company did that by agreeing to issue stock valued at $1.2 =
billion to Raptor under certain conditions. This stock pledge essentially se=
rved as Raptor's assets; in return, Enron took a note receivable, or simply =
a loan, from Raptor for $1.2 billion.=20
As it happened, Enron benefited massively from the assets hedge. It protecte=
d itself against a $500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $453 milli=
on in 2001. These hedging gains were netted out to zero in Enron core earnin=
gs, because they were offset by declines in asset values. But without the he=
dges, Enron would've taken the losses in its expense line.=20
Vince Carter
Of course, the problem was that Raptor, and therefore LJM2, was losing from =
the hedges. That might've been tolerable if Raptor were making money from th=
e stock agreement. But Enron's stock began falling sharply in 2001, deprivin=
g LJM2 of potential profits. Meanwhile, as the stock price slid, Enron was h=
aving to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to Raptor at $1=
=2E2 billion. As the decline continued into the third quarter, and the issua=
nce commitment grew, it made sense to unwind all the Raptor deals with LJM2.=
=20
At this point, Enron took the $1.2 billion charge to equity in the third qua=
rter to reverse the equity pledge. Enron did take some of Raptor's hedging l=
osses itself, but it did so through a $711 million pretax charge, which it c=
hose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter.=20
The big question is whether LJM2 actually took any losses itself from Raptor=
=2E Why is that crucial? If Enron shielded LJM2 from losses, it was essentia=
lly dealing with itself. The SEC and investors wouldn't like that. What clue=
s are there that LJM2 didn't take a loss? Well, the Thursday press release s=
ays that Enron bought out LJM2's stakes in Raptor for $35 million. That make=
s little sense. How can LJM2 have had any Raptor equity left after the losse=
s it appears to have sustained? If Enron made LJM2 whole, then this was all =
little more than a shell game.=20
Seems like Enron still has a whole lot more to tell us.=20

Enron Reissues Financial Reports Energy: The company restates four years to =
clear questions related to a series of controversial partnerships.

Enron Corp. on Thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four =
years, shaving nearly $600 million in profit from what it previously reporte=
d.=20
The action was designed to clear nagging questions about the Houston-based e=
nergy concern's finances stemming from a series of controversial partnership=
s. Those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of Enron shares=
 and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with r=
ival Dynegy Inc.
However, the action still left analysts wondering whether further negative d=
isclosures might be coming.=20
Analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now=
, while it is negotiating to be acquired by Houston-based Dynegy.=20
Both companies confirmed merger talks Thursday. Some analysts suggested the =
deal has problems and could pose new risks for Dynegy.=20
Enron also said that it fired Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mourda=
nt, an attorney with the company. Both executives had a financial interest i=
n at least one of the partnerships. In October, Enron replaced Chief Financi=
al Officer Andrew Fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships.=20
The restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationsh=
ip between several senior Enron executives and a series of partnerships crea=
ted by the energy concern.=20
"A massive restatement like this doesn't look good. But since Enron was alre=
ady under such scrutiny, it's really not much of a surprise," said Christoph=
er Ellinghaus, an analyst with Williams Capital in New York.=20
"This would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced=
," Ellinghaus added.=20
Enron shares fell 64 cents Thursday to close at $8.41, its lowest finish sin=
ce 1992 and less than 10% of the nearly $90 high the company hit Aug. 23, 20=
00. Dynegy shares rose $3.50 to $36.50. Both trade on the New York Stock Exc=
hange. .=20
Analysts said Enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnership=
s to purchase assets such as fiber-optic lines that Enron wanted to move off=
 its books.=20
Although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balanc=
e sheets, the deals are almost always with third parties and private investo=
rs rather than company executives. The involvement of executives as investor=
s in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest, said Br=
ian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about the f=
inancial transactions between Enron and the partnerships, which were approve=
d by Enron lawyers and directors.=20
In essence, the partnerships reduced borrowings Enron listed on its balance =
sheet. They protected its credit rating, helping it to obtain favorable inte=
rest rates on its corporate borrowings.=20
However, after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures, Enron sai=
d in an SEC filing Thursday that it should have included the financial perfo=
rmance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet.=20
The filing included a restatement of Enron financial statements for 1997 thr=
ough 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001. It said its previous financi=
al documents "should not be relied upon."=20
Enron's new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net inco=
me for that nearly four-year period by $586 million, or about 20%, to $2.3 b=
illion. The biggest change was a $250-million reduction in net income for 19=
99.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing Enron at about $1=
0 a share, or about $8 billion, according to sources familiar with the negot=
iations. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns nearly 27% of Dynegy, would pour $1=
=2E5 billion in cash into Enron up front, with $1 billion to follow at the c=
lose of the transaction.=20
Dynegy would assume $12.8 billion in Enron debt, which does not include the =
off-balance-sheet partnerships, the sources said.=20
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay would remain on the board =
of the merged company but would not have day-to-day responsibilities, the so=
urces said.=20
Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson would assume those jobs at =
the combined company, and Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom would become pr=
esident, they said.=20
There is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached, and if it is, such =
a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators. Th=
e potential merger would have its problems, some analysts said.=20
Dynegy risks losing Enron's most important asset, its energy traders, who ca=
n easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the Houston area, said And=
re Meade, head of U.S. utilities research for Commerzbank Securities.=20
Dynegy, like Enron, needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell asset=
s and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses, said Carol Levenson, an=
 analyst with Gimmecredit.com. A thumbs-down by the stock market could serio=
usly jeopardize Dynegy's financial flexibility, she said.=20
Although Enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy tra=
ding and marketing business remains sound, the company's severe cash crunch =
has hurt. Enron's online trading operation has lost business in recent days.

Enron may have to sell UK assets

Enron, the debt-stricken energy trading group, could be forced to sell its m=
ain British assets under the terms of an $8bn takeover being considered by D=
ynegy, its smaller rival.=20
The two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeov=
er, which would see Houston firm Dynegy, about a fifth of the size of its ta=
rget, pay a "fire-sale" price worth about a tenth of Enron's $70bn value a y=
ear ago.
The outcome would be a humiliation for Enron, Amer ica's largest energy trad=
er, which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the Republican=
 party and the presidential campaign last year. It has been forlornly courti=
ng cash injections from groups such as Shell in the past few days to keep it=
 afloat.=20
Enron's shares have lost 90% of their value this year, going into free fall =
in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director Andrew Fastow for unusua=
l partnership transactions carried out off-balance sheet. These forced it to=
 take a $1bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $1.2bn.=20
Two other senior officials, including Enron's treasurer, were fired yesterda=
y following their involvement in the murky Fastow deals, which are being inv=
estigated by the securities and exchange commission.=20
Pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today be=
tween Enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was=
 forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four year=
s, amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status.=20
ChevronTexaco, the oil group which owns 27% of Dynegy, would inject up to $2=
=2E5bn if the deal goes ahead. Enron, also based in Houston, owns Wessex Wat=
er, for which it paid pounds 1.4bn in 1998, and gas-fired power stations in =
Britain, including the high-performing 1900MW Teesside plant. It recently an=
nounced deals to run the energy management operations of Sainsbury and Guinn=
ess.=20
Dynegy is paying pounds 421m for BG's gas storage business, a deal expected =
to be concluded next month, but, renowned for its "stingy" financial managem=

Enron restates earnings as company confirms merger talks
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - Now that Enron Corp. acknowledged it overstated earnings for=
 years and its stock price has been punished accordingly, a much smaller riv=
al, Dynegy Inc., is in talks to possibly buy the nation's top energy trader =
on the cheap.=20
Houston-based Enron has become inexpensive after investors pummeled its stoc=
k price over concerns that serious financial problems were being hidden from=
 shareholders through business partnerships now under investigation by the S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission.
In an SEC filing Thursday, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through=
 the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that outside busines=
ses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in t=
he company's earnings reports.=20
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, fro=
m $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. In addition, the company revised its debt =
upward in each year from 1997-2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10=
=2E86 billion, $628 million more than previously reported.=20
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger c=
redit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations=
 - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets.=20
And while Enron kept certain details about its finances secret, the company'=
s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew.=20
Investors from Wall Street to Main Street sought a piece of the action as En=
ron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would suc=
cessfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well, in=
cluding steel and broadband communications.=20
However, after a decade in which Enron firmly established itself as the nati=
on's No. 1 natural gas and power marketing company, things have not gone acc=
ording to plan lately and the former high-flyer has experienced a remarkably=
 fast fall from grace.=20
Enron's stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent hi=
gh-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum =
was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers =
in India.=20
Then, in the past three weeks, Enron's share price plummeted fast and furiou=
sly as the company announced a $618 million third quarter loss, ousted its c=
hief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for ca=
sh to remain an independent entity.=20
Several news organizations were reporting that Dynegy was negotiating to buy=
 Enron for $8 billion in stock, but that the tentative deal could still fall=
 apart.=20
Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Ele=
ctric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.=20
On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were =
in talks, but declined to provide any details.=20
The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Houston Chronicle, among=
 others, reported Thursday that Dynegy is considering paying about $8 billio=
n in stock for Enron, citing people familiar with the matter. ChevronTexaco =
Corp., which has a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, would provide Enron an immedi=
ate cash infusion of $1 billion, the papers reported.=20
Enron's Lay would not be given any formal management position in the combine=
d company, although he would have a seat on its board, the Journal reported.=
=20
Enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could "appropr=
iately value the strength of our core businesses."=20
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number o=
f the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about t=
hese matters," said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive=20
The company also fired treasurer Ben Glisan and a lawyer, Kristina Mordaunt,=
 on Thursday. Last month, Enron ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow=
, who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the SEC.=20
Jeff Skilling, Enron's former chief executive who left in August, has been c=
alled to testify before the SEC, although it's unclear when.=20
Wall Street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of Enron=
, but said a merger with Dynegy would help improve Enron's credibility.=20
Still, Prudential Securities analyst Carole Coale remained puzzled as to "wh=
y Dynegy's management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential =
liabilities associated with a merger with Enron."=20
Christopher Ellinghaus of Williams Capital in New York said Enron's accounti=
ng "shenanigans" are legendary in the industry.=20
"I'm not willing to say it's fraud yet," Ellinghaus said. "Enron just likes =
to be fancy. They may have been too fancy for their own good."=20
Enron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net =
income of about $96 million in 1997, $113 million in 1998, $250 million in 1=

Before its stunning fall from grace, Enron Corp. was a genuine market darlin=
g, with a throng of adoring investors, analysts and academics who held it ou=
t as a model of how to turn a sleepy, Old Economy company into a true star o=
f the fast-paced New Economy. Even after the puncturing of the market bubble=
, the critics who had long questioned the Texas company's aggressive growth =
strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old-fashioned=
 cranks.=20
Now, in no small part because of its executives' own highhandedness and dism=
issive treatment of those same investors and analysts, Enron's reputation is=
 in tatters, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing billions=
 of dollars worth of off-balance-sheet transactions, its once high-flying st=
ock has tanked, its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for trouble=
d junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast.
About the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in=
 investing and long espoused by the likes of Warren Buffett: Never buy anyth=
ing you don't understand and don't touch a company whose finances are so mur=
ky as to defy description.=20
There's no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less inves=
tors know about their true financial state, the better. The dot-bomb rubble =
is littered with them. They include Nortel Networks, Cisco Systems, Lucent T=
echnologies, Amazon.com, JDS Uniphase, Qwest Communications, Motorola, Volks=
wagen and even Starbucks.=20
In these bearish times, most companies acknowledge, albeit reluctantly, that=
 they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested int=
erest in their future.=20
Here is what Joe Nacchio, defiant boss of troubled Qwest, told a conference =
last month: "You all think we cheat and lie and steal, obviously, and theref=
ore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue a=
nd great growth should be traded. . . . We'll just let the numbers speak for=
 themselves on Oct. 31."=20
So along comes that fateful day, and we pass the mike over to Mr. Nacchio: "=
Some of you will recall that at a recent conference I said the results will =
speak for themselves. The reality is they do not speak clearly for themselve=
s without some interpretation, given the current economic conditions and the=
 effects of merger and other one-time charges." You can guess what happened =
to Qwest's credibility and its stock price.=20
As for Houston-based Enron, which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to sh=
ore up its vast energy-trading business and keep its credit rating from bein=
g slashed below investment grade, the company confirmed yesterday it's in ta=
lks with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy. Several published accounts have sa=
id the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $2-billion and an e=
ventual merger.=20
Faced with the SEC probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits, Enron also reve=
aled that its profit statements since 1997 aren't worth anything. The compan=
y is restating earnings through the first half of this year, mainly to refle=
ct a $1.2-billion (U.S.) drop in shareholder equity after the company termin=
ated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships. The deali=
ngs had enabled Enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge wha=
ck of debt on its balance sheet, which would have affected its ability to ra=
ise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline=
 utility to global energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Such transactions are common and practical. But Enron's were unusually compl=
icated, and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itse=
lf.=20
Disclosure has never been this company's middle name. The former CEO once us=
ed a seven-letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to a=

approval, two partnerships had been set up, to considerable personal profit,=
 by Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Faston. He walked the plank =
on Oct. 24, and the company has been scrambling ever since.=20
Opaque accounting doesn't necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot. =

Enron Meets Indian Lenders on Power Plant Stake Sale (Update3)

Enron Meets Indian Lenders on Power Plant Stake Sale (Update3)

     (Adds lender's comments in ninth paragraph, detail on IDBI's
exposure to Enron in 11th.)

     Singapore, Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, is meeting lenders about its sale of a
stake in a $3 billion Indian power project as it seeks to raise
cash and forestall a possible credit downgrade.

     Enron, which lost 89 percent of its market value this year,
had its long-term credit rating cut as low as one notch above junk
status this week and would have to repay $3.3 billion in bonds
early if its rating is cut below investment grade.

     Dynegy Inc., which is in talks to buy Enron for about $8
billion in stock, is concerned about a downgrade after Enron
yesterday restated its earnings for more than four years to
include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior
executives, people familiar with the situation said.

     ``Restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of
fraud, which in itself is justification for a downgrade,'' said
Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the Harris
Insight Equity Fund. ``I'd be surprised if they're not
downgraded.''

     The decision by Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay to reduce earnings by $586 million since 1997 is part
of Enron's efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by
the stock's plunge this year and a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation into how the company accounted for
partnerships it sponsored.

     Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, a
lawyer for an Enron division. The company said it now believes
Glisan, Mordaunt and two other employees no longer working for
Enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by
former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     Enron ousted Fastow last month after revealing an accounting
error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted
in a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third
quarter. Arthur Andersen LLP was Enron's independent auditor.

                               India

     Enron wants $1 billion for its 65 percent stake in an Indian
power plant unit, Dabhol Power Co. Potential buyers Tata Power Co.
and BSES Ltd., which are at the meeting with lenders in Singapore,
said that's too much.

     ``Tata and BSES are keen to buy the project but much will
depend on the terms Enron sets,'' said V.K. Saxena, chief general
manager at Industrial Development Bank of India, or IDBI, the
country's second-biggest lender. ``I'm positive'' on the outcome
of the talks.

     Enron on May 19 gave six months' notice to cancel sales to
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the only customer of
Dabhol Power. Dabhol's owed $64 million for bills that are 10
months overdue. The contract to sell the plant's electricity will
be canceled on Nov. 19.

     IDBI and the State Bank of India are among the local lenders
meeting Enron in Singapore. Indian banks, which have loaned $1.4
billion to Dabhol, have the most at stake if a buyer for Enron's
stake isn't found. IDBI alone has lent more than $400 million.

     The $600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc. and other overseas banks are covered by government
guarantees, while Indian bank's loans are not.

     Still, not all investors in the local banks are worried by
the prospect of loans turning bad if talks with Enron and Tata and
BSES fail.

     ``This deal is too complex, too big to fail,'' said Rajat
Jain, who oversees 15 billion rupees at IDBI-Principal Asset
Management Co., a unit of the country's second-biggest lender.
``There's a lot of money at stake here. All parties, including
lenders, will have to take a hit but the deal will go through.''

     Jain's stock funds had 1.23 million shares of ICICI Ltd. at
end of September after selling 25,813 shares. ICICI is India's
biggest lender and one of Dabhol's key creditors.

     The meeting started yesterday and bankers that attended the
meeting said the talks will end today, Saxena said.

Canadian Pwr, Gas Mkts Benefiting From Enron's Woes
By Dina O'Meara

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- Canadian natural gas and power exchanges are gaining s=
trength as market unease over U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financia=
l woes increases and traders look to alternative vehicles, insiders said Thu=
rsday.=20
Buyers and sellers are turning more to Alberta's power and natural gas excha=
nges as they shun the increasingly wobbly Enron.
"We see this as an opportunity to capture some of the market EnronOnLine had=
," WattEx president Sheldon Fulton told Dow Jones Newswires.=20
"It has also resulted in reinforcing the need for transparent pricing mechan=
isms and forward price curves," he said.=20
Enron, a Houston-based market-mover accounting for a quarter of North Americ=
an power and gas trades, has seen its credit ratings downgraded and its shar=
e price slashed since mid-October over uncertainty about its complex financi=
al structure.=20
In response, energy companies in Canada have changed their strategies. Some,=
 like PowerEx, British Columbia Hydro's marketing arm, reduced Enron's credi=
t limit on day trades and dropped any long-term financial deals with the tro=
ubled company.=20
Others are keeping their strategies to themselves, commenting only that Enro=
n's position as a major player makes it important for the entire industry to=
 see a positive resolution to its woes, and maintain market liquidity.=20
"We continue to do business with Enron," said Jennifer Pierce, manager of pu=
blic affairs for Duke Energy in Houston. "We will continue to monitor activi=
ties as they go on and deal with credit guidelines that are established with=
 them."=20
And some are not dealing with Enron at all.=20
"We are not doing anything with (Enron)," a trader with a major natural gas =
pipeline said. "There are a lot of players out there."=20
Spot deals on Alberta's Natural Gas Exchange hit 1.6 billion cubic feet Thur=
sday, volumes that were up but not record-breakers, NGX vice-president Gary =
Gault said.=20
"It's tough for us to tell if the increase is due to Enron's problems," Gaul=
t said. "But there is no question there are credit issues in the market righ=
t now over them."=20
Alberta's NGX and Enron recently started joint submissions of near-month and=
 daily traded volumes on a real-time basis to the NGX-owned Canadian Gas Pri=
ce Reporter Index. The move created a more realistic view of the Alberta mar=
ket, traders said, as Enron's near-month volumes were consistently higher th=
an the Canadian exchange.=20
"This has obviously created a lot more interest in other trading vehicles," =
one source said. "But this is just like when a big bank gets into trouble - =
the whole economy is affected."=20
Enron confirmed it is in talks with rival energy company Dynegy Inc. (DNY) i=
n a US$7 billion to US$8 billion paper deal in stock.=20
The embattled company also restated nearly five years of earnings Thursday.=20

Uncertainties Cloud View Of An Enron-Dynegy Combination
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/08/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- It's not clear yet how formidable an energy compan=
y would emerge if Dynegy, Inc. (DYN) were to step out of embattled Enron Cor=
p.'s (ENE) shadow and acquire it.=20
Energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment, though: a merger =
may be the only way to keep Enron from going under and possible harming U.S.=
 energy markets overall.
Enron and Dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in =
the U.S., and meshing Enron's trading expertise with Dynegy's power plants w=
ould seem the recipe for success.=20
But there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on=
 the topic, analysts and energy companies said.=20
"They're in the same business and they know each other really well," said St=
even Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER). "But until I see te=
rms of the deal and more important conditions, I'd be cautious on making any=
 judgements."=20
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy and Enron are in t=
alks that could lead to a merger in a stock swap worth $7 billion to $8 bill=
ion. The talks are aimed at stabilizing Enron's finances. The Houston energy=
 giant's credit ratings have been downgraded and the company's stock price h=
as plunged 75% following the mid-October disclosure of a $1.2 billion writed=
own of shareholder equity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is in=
vestigating Enron partnerships associated with the writedown.=20
Dynegy confirmed that it's in talks with Enron for some sort of deal. It's n=
ot yet clear, however, whether that means a merger or just a capital infusio=
n.=20
Enron has been turned away by a number of firms where it sought to secure fi=
nancing. A merger, according to a number of sources, would help prevent big =
troubles for many energy companies.=20
"Enron is such a large player and they're so important in terms of maintaini=
ng liquidity of the markets," said Sandy Fruhman, a spokeswoman for Reliant =
Inc. (REI), a large energy company. "We see this [the potential collapse of =
Enron] as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry."=
=20
Dynegy, like Enron, is a leading marketer of natural gas and electricity. It=
s Houston offices are a stone's throw away from Enron's in what's known as "=
Energy Alley," where other companies like Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and El P=
aso Corp. are also housed.=20
Dynegy, however, is more focused on hard assets. Dynegy owns and/or operates=
 19,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. and sells about 11 bill=
ion cubic feet of natural gas per day. It also has joint ventures in power p=
lants with NRG Energy Inc. (NRG).=20
Its market share is far smaller than Enron's. But with Enron's pipeline asse=
ts, Dynegy's power plants and both companies' electricity and natural gas ho=
ldings, some analysts say a combined company would corner the market.=20
In some ways, it would be a natural fit. Dynegy has modeled its business, pa=
rticularly its natural gas and electricity trading operation, after Enron's,=
 said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York.=20
"Dynegy has generally followed a lot of the moves Enron made over the years,=
" Meade said. "Not surprisingly, they have a lot of the same business. Their=
 trading and online platform are similar. Ideally, they would combine the tw=
o. They both nearly have the same loss from their broadband business. Dynegy=
 wants to expand in Europe and Enron is already there."=20
Kevin Boone, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York, said the Top 20 energ=
y companies in the U.S. wouldn't likely be able to encroach on Enron's forme=
r share in the marketplace if Dynegy and Enron merge.=20
But big companies including Williams Cos. (WMB), Reliant and Duke Energy Cor=
p. (DUK), could still easily compete if such a merger took place, he added.=20
Chevron Texaco Corp. (CVX) holds a 29% stake in Dynegy and would likely want=
 to keep that share if the two companies were combined.=20
ChevronTexaco, which recently completed its own merger, may contribute about=
 $1.5 billion to push the deal with Dynegy and Enron forward, according to p=

Enron Earnings Drop

ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, BUSINESS UNUSUAL: The energy trading giant Enron (=
URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is restating its earnings downward. This announ=
cement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into it=
s off balance sheet deals. Those are deals that push the company to reduce s=
hareholders` equity by more than $1 billion. Fred Katayama has this report.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Enron delivered another bom=
bshell on a day when Wall Street was anticipating a merger announcement. The=
 tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include los=
ses from partnerships now under investigation. Enron is reducing its net inc=
ome since 1997 by nearly $600 million. The company said it is consolidating =
the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet. =
Enron would pump assets into a partnership, then have the partnership borrow=
 money so that the debt was kept off of its books. Consolidating the partner=
ships also boosted Enron`s debt by more than $2.5 billion.=20
RON BARONE, UBS WARBURG: If they lose their investment grade on their debt, =
the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $3 billion either =
in cash or Enron stock.=20
KATAYAMA: Enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had investe=
d in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow =
(ph). The SEC is investigating the two partnerships set up by Fastow. Chairm=
an Kenneth Lay said in a statement, we believe that the information we have =
made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by o=
ur shareholders and the SEC about these matters.=20
ANDRE MEADE, COMMERZBANK SECURITIES: The disclosure probably raises as many =
questions as it answers and what Enron, what Enron`s trying to do is or what=
 Enron has done.=20
KATAYAMA: Enron stock slumped further and Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com=
/) rose on the news. Investors were disappointed because they had hoped Dyne=
gy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
KATAYAMA: Now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal. Dynegy will=
 have to recalculate Enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for =
those restated numbers, it may not be the last of those restatements. That`s=
 because, in this current case, today`s disclosure concerned only three enti=
ties. Enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships. Ali.=20
VELSHI: Fred, tell me about these partnerships. Is this common?=20
KATAYAMA: Other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference=
 is the scope of Enron. Say it deals with more than 30 of them. Plus they`re=
 extremely complex. Even Wall Street analysts said they couldn`t figure them=
 out. And you don`t have a chief financial officer of your company running s=
ome of these partnerships that are doing business with your company.=20
VELSHI: Let`s talk about Enron stock. This used to be a darling stock. It`s =
trading $1.40 off its 52-week low. In fact at this moment, it`s one tenth of=
 its 52-week high.=20
KATAYAMA: Right. You know, that stock used to be as you say, a darling of Wa=
ll Street. It traded almost like a tech stock. Because here was this pipelin=
e company in Texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics, was into broa=
dband and it traded like a tech stock. It also fell like a tech stock. That =
stock is down 73 percent over the last month, down 89 percent year to date a=
nd was down 10 days in a row in October.=20
VELSHI: Let`s talk about Dynegy. Last night on this show the news came out t=
hat Dynegy was going to pump some money into Enron and that over the course =
of the next 12 hours, that became discussions on a merger and a partnership.=
 I don`t want to use the word partnership. Tell me what`s likely to happen t=
here.=20
KATAYAMA: Well, the thing is, Wall Street was really anticipating, based on =
yesterday`s build up, that we get an announcement today saying the two compa=
nies would merge, that Dynegy would buy Enron, possibly for 7, 8 billion. Bu=
t a lot of analysts say one, Dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based=
 on those restatements and two, even if there is a deal, Enron will get zero=
 premium or very little because there`s very little negotiating room. It`s g=
ot $13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it.=20
VELSHI: Any indication of when we`re going to hear about this restating and =
what we`re going to see happen out of it? That`s always bad news when you`ve=
 got to restate for that far back.=20
KATAYAMA: And it always hangs on a stock. You remember it happened to Cendan=
t (URL: http://www.cendant.com/) . You remember it happened to Sunbeam (URL:=
 http://www.sunbeam.com/) . The thing is, it`s probably going to unravel ove=
r weeks and it`s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any de=
al may be dragged down. That`s a problem, because what are Enron`s assets? T=
raders, human capital. And in times of uncertainty, human capital goes to ot=
her companies and Texas has a lot of energy trading companies.=20
VELSHI: Fred, thanks very much for being with us.=20

Enron Curtails Activity In US Power,Gas Mkt Thu -Traders

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. power and natural gas traders reported that Enron=
 Corp. (ENE) pulled back its presence in some of its core markets Thursday.=20
Enron, which typically accounts for about a quarter of the volume of trade i=
n U.S. power and gas markets, significantly limited its bids to buy and offe=
rs to sell power and gas on its Internet-based trading system EnronOnline, w=
here it does the bulk of its business, traders said.
EnronOnline posted bids and offers for Gulf Coast and Northeast natural gas =
for only about an hour Thursday morning, compared with about three hours usu=
ally.=20
"They put their postings up, then they pulled them back off," one trader sai=
d.=20
Enron also posted a slim market in western U.S. gas and power early Thursday=
 morning, a western power and gas trader said. EnronOnline posted a normal m=
arket later that morning, but by afternoon had sharply reduced its electrici=
ty market offerings, presenting bids and offers only for hourly products.=20
Postings in Northeast power markets were normal, a trader said. Another trad=
er, however, said EnronOnline was posting much lower bids and higher offers =
on many liquid products than those presented by voice brokers or competing o=
nline platforms - the equivalent of pulling itself out of the market.=20
Enron spokesman Eric Thode didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday =
afternoon. Earlier in the day, Thode said transactions on EnronOnline totale=
d an above-average 6,200 on Wednesday. Volume estimates for Thursday weren't=
 available then.=20
On Thursday, Enron confirmed reports that it was in talks for a cash infusio=
n from and possible acquisition by competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN).=20
Thursday morning, Enron said it was restating its financial statements from =
1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit repo=
rts were unreliable for all those periods. The company also fired its treasu=
rer and general counsel.=20
The company's share price has fallen by about 75% and its credit ratings hav=
e been downgraded in the past three weeks, following disclosures of losses i=
n shareholder equity related to transactions with partnerships headed by Enr=
on's former chief financial officer.=20

IN THE MONEY:Enron Debacle Could Push Accounting Changes
By Carol S. Remond

11/08/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron =
Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidati=
on of financial results.
Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its re=
lationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial stat=
ements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its =
results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, low=
ering them by a collective $586 million.=20
Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate lo=
ss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping=
 those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statem=
ents).=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a pro=
ject that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one=
 of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board=
 first started considering the issue.=20
"This is an area where FASB is struggling" to set new criteria, said Alan Br=
omberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of=
 Law of The Southern Methodist University.=20
FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and i=
t has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majori=
ty ownership.=20
The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on anot=
her arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliat=
ed outsiders.=20
Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an E=
merging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a mi=
nimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualif=
y for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since.=20
According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investmen=
t of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on t=
he credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status.=20
Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by =
some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was c=
onsidering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to =
qualify for non consolidation.=20
Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor=
 since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and rec=
ent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm "contin=
ues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution =
to this matter."=20
The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regul=
ators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million t=
o settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Su=
nbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went int=
o Chapter 11 bankruptcy.=20
The accounting firm and three partners were fined $7 million by the SEC earl=
ier this year over their audit of Waste Management Inc.'s financial statemen=
ts, the largest SEC fine ever against an accounting firm. The SEC held that =
Andersen overstated Waste Management's pre-tax earnings by $1 billion.=20
The SEC has launched a formal investigation in the Enron matter. The Arthur =
Andersen spokesman said the SEC had not notified his firm that it is the sub=
ject of any investigation.=20
