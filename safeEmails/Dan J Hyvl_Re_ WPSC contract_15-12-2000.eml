Kim,
 I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing=20
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I=20
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron=20
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you=
=20
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contac=
t=20
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been=
=20
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be.=20
 If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution=20
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC. =20
 Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy=20
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

Dan-

Please confirm that you have received the executable copies of the Wisconsin
Public Service contracts and Enron Corp guarantees.

Also, could you please give me an estimated date that Enron will mail the
partially executed contracts and executed guarantees to WPSC?  We would
appreciate them being sent by overnight mail.

Thanks,
Kim
