We didn't really cover the role you intended to play with EES and EBS as far=
=20
as Doorstep is concerned when we met with Causey/Buy.  (Or I just can't=20
remember.) May we include EES and EBS in the scope of our one Doorstep=20
project, and continue to work with Shona, also coordinating with Wanda and=20
Barry when EES and EBS are involved?  Things like the event below might make=
=20
us re-consider our need to visit "origination" offices.  I don't think this=20
office was on any of our lists.

Subject: Bankruptcy

LTV Steel, a counterparty of Clinton Gas, which is a subsidiary of EES went=20
bankrupt. EES exposure is ~$6 million. This transaction has not been approve=
d=20
by the Credit group and it seems that they have little clue about Enron's=20
processes and procedures. I believe Clinton Gas is located in Dublin, Ohio=20
and suggest that it be included on the Door Step list.
