Cooper,

There is a great Indian buffet a couple blocks from here.
I suggest that we go there for lunch.

Do you want to see the new offcies before or after lunch?
We can always decide in the morning depending upon how the=20
day is going.

How was the weekend?

I was in Canmore and the weather was great!
The climbing was a bit shakey...

Craig
