David,

Just a question as to whether Dynegy has been notified that we are amending =
the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing =
with performance bonus memo?  We may want to send a brief email confirming t=
he discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files.

Thanks.

Michelle
