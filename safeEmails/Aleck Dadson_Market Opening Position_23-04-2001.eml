Eric, we are pretty sure the announcement will be that they will open the=20
market by May 2002.  Today, senior political and bureaucratic staff in the=20
Ministry of Energy have gone out of their way to stress that the announcemen=
t=20
is designed to leave open the  real possibility of an earlier opening (i.e.=20
in November 2001) if that is feasible.   As matters stand, I think that our=20
response should be: a) We are pleased by the reaffirmation of the gov'ts=20
intention to move forward with competition in the Ontario power market; b)=20
our understanding of the position is that it leaves open the  real=20
possibility of opening the market earlier, such as of November 1, 2001;  c)=20
we continue to believe that an opening in November  2001 is feasible and in=20
the best interests of Ontario (for the reasons set forth in Ken Lay's speech=
)=20
; and  d) accordingly, we will continue to work towards a November opening=20
and we encourage all others in the market  to do the=20
same.                      Peter Varley of GPC is going to give you a call.=20
