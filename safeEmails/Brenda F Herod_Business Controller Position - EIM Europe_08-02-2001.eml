Per my voicemails to each of you....

Jenny Latham is currently a manager in Power Risk in Houston, and is=20
interested in moving to London.  She is very well respected within Enron, an=
d=20
is a highly rated employee.  She has been with Enron for several years, in=20
various positions, and will move us far ahead in the staffing.  In January, =
I=20
met with Yvonne Scorer to identify recruiting needs to build the mid and bac=
k=20
office for the London activity for EIM.  One position identified, Business=20
Controller, is the position I have discussed with Jenny, and she is very=20
interested.  I am anxious to move this forward ASAP for a couple of reasons:=
 =20
1).  Jenny is interested, and I do not want to lose her to other=20
opportunities within the London office, and 2).  It is not too early to move=
=20
forward on the staffing of the office as it will take some time to=20
appropriately staff and transition current support from EGM.

Bruce, last week Jenny and I met with you, and we discussed that it would be=
=20
appropriate for Jenny to spend time with us here in Houston to learn our=20
current processes, commoditiies, etc.  I absolutely agree with this, but we=20
need to make a deal with her before we can start that process.   The sequenc=
e=20
of events that make sense to me and that I believe would make Jenny the most=
=20
comfortable is that we 1).  agree on the financial package (Compensation,=20
moving allowance, etc), 2).  transition her current responsibilities within=20
Power Risk, and 3).  begin training with us.  Simultaneously, we will need t=
o=20
recruit applicants for the remaining positions in Risk, Documentation,=20
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  My goal is to have everything in place in=
=20
London by the end of first quarter. =20

To meet this time line, we need to get more information and have a discussio=
n=20
with Meryl on the specifics.  Bruce, can you give Meryl the green light to=20
move forward with us?  I appreciate your help.
