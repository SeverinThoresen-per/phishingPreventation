We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us=20
anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from=20
CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom. =20
We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS=20
contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to cha=
t=20
with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why is the pipeline set up as CGAS=20
and what exactly do you mean by doing the noms via CGAS?  Does that mean tha=
t=20
we turn the noms into CGAS who then gives them to KO?  It's been a long time=
=20
since I scheduled CGAS and KO, but I remember that when I had a KO nominatio=
n=20
I use to fax KO a paper nom directly and we use to put everything into=20
autonoms under the KO matrix and not the CGAS matrix.  What makes this=20
different?  Just curious.....

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission=20
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I=20
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.=
 =20
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO=20
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on=
=20
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport=20
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these=20
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small. =20
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??
