Rick -=20

Joe Hirl is scheduled to visit the Houston office this week and I think he i=
s trying to schedule a meeting with you.  Bill Bradford mentioned that I mig=
ht want to bring you up to speed on some of the recent developments in that =
office. Though much of the background information is probably old news for y=
ou, there are some issues that might come up in your meeting.

As you know, Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets.  To=
 date, Enron Japan has not submitted proposals for new  VaR limits or produc=
ts, but I believe their meetings with the Houston management this week are t=
o determine such.  I think by the end of the week, they will have a better i=
dea of what exactly they will trade, what limits they will want trade under,=
 the systems they will need to implement, etc. =20

Last week, the commercial team discussed with me the possibilities of tradin=
g petrochemicals through  a new exchange - The Tokyo Commodities Exchange.  =
To jumpstart the Global Markets business, the team intends to be quite activ=
e on the exchange, trading Gasoline and Kerosene.

=46rom a Credit perspective, we need to get a better idea of how transaction=
s in the exchange will be managed.  The exchange is unusual in that there is=
 not a clearinghouse.  Rather, any order we post will be matched to a specif=
ic counterparty, which could be any of 80 or so "Broker Members".  Credit ri=
sk is somewhat mitigated in that each counterparty in every trade must post =
an initial margin amount to be held and used to reduce default risk.  Howeve=
r, as far as I can tell, there will be no incremental margin call when expos=
ure increases beyond the initial margin amount.  This has the potential of o=
pening Enron to significant counterparty risk with counterparties with whom =
we might not necessarily be comfortable.  The information packet I received =
does vaguely discuss a "Protection Fund" that might mitigate default risk.  =
I will follow-up on this issue, but for now, protection is unclear.

=46rom a market risk perspective, I will make sure the team has the appropri=
ate approvals in place for VaR limits and products to be traded prior to tra=
nsacting.  I will also make sure the right systems are in place to capture t=
ransactions, volumes, etc. - and have these aggregate into the daily RiskTra=
c reports.

=46rom an Underwriting perspective, there seems to be one transaction that i=
s worth mentioning (others are still in preliminary stages).  Jeremy Thirsk =
is working on a large ($40-50MM) Methanol prepay agreement with Nissho Iwai =
- a struggling Japanese counterparty.  Though the DASH is still being drafte=
d, it is worth noting that this transaction not only carries significant cou=
nterparty credit risk, but the methanol purchases will take place in Indones=
ia  - adding operating and country risks into the equation.  Jeremy and I di=
scussed various actions we could take to mitigate risks  - taking liens on a=
ssets, credit default swaps, insurance, and corporate supply obligation agre=
ements.   I have not heard back from Jeremy this week, but thought you might=
 need to know this is out there in case it comes up in your meeting with Hir=
l.=20

The commercial team in the process of shifting gears right now, and I am not=
 sure how long it will take for them to have things in order enough to trans=
act.  I will keep everyone posted on their progress. Please let me know if y=
ou would like to see anything in further detail.
