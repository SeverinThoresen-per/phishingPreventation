As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently look=
ing at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 200=
2.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where service=
s (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a =
usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets =
in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices=
 to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the =
proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident =
that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of E=
nronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about yo=
ur plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look fo=
rward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter
