Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus=20
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into=20
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract=20
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into variou=
s=20
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to=20
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport=20
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether=20
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then,=20
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are=
=20
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered=20
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the=20
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be=
=20
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas=20
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I=20
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the=20
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enoug=
h=20
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.
