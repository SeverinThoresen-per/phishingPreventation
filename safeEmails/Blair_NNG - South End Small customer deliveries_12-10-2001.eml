	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow=
 this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at "small customer=
 delivery points"
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few id=
eas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, bu=
t we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with u=
s to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Univ=
erse.  It can still be
	     required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is t=
oday.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to =
do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cove=
r these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could w=
e get Oneok to agree to=20
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from th=
e Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn
