Along the same lines as my previous request for Intratex's company=20
dissolution, I would like to verify the status of HPL Resources Company and,=
=20
if it is also dissolved, would request a copy of the dissolution.

I am making filings to the State's Comptroller's office for payment of=20
suspensed moneys and the form requires this type of information and=20
documentation.

Thanks, and would appreciate this information at your earliest convenience.

Candy
