Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem =
to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my stat=
ement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conver=
sation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed.=20

I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each me=
eting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the =
estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with=
 Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues. =20

I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on=
 an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status=
 of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in C=
alifornia (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).=
  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some o=
f the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company. =20

I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over din=
ner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good =
group.  --Sally=20

How are you doing? Still with us in the little boat? :)

Have you and Jim talked about setting up the infrastructure?

Regards

I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.   I have an eye doctor's ap=
pointment at 9:30, so it is also unlikely that I will be able to call in, un=

ial in number with me to the appointment in the event that I am somewhere in=
 the process that allows me to dial in.  --Sally=20
