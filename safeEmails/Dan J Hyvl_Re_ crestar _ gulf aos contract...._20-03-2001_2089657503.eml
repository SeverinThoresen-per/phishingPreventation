Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to=
=20
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the=20
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the=20
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to=20
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 t=
o=20
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we ca=
n=20
discuss.

I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to=20
BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the=20
entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.=20
