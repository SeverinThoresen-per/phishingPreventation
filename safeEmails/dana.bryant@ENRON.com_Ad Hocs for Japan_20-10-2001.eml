Alison,
The employment agreements for the Japan employees state in the vesting sched=
ule [for the stock options granted as a signing bonus]:
vesting for the options will be as follows:
-One third on the first anniversary of date of employment
-A further third on the second anniversary date of employment
-The final third on the third anniversary date of employment

The options can not vest on the anniversary of the date of employment, rathe=
r it is supposed to vest on the anniversary of date of grant.
Michelle,
Correct me if I am wrong--we can still go ahead and grant these for the Nove=
mber 1 grant date, but we need to get an amendment to change that wording.
Thank you
Dana Bryant
