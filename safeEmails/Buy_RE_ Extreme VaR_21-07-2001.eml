Subject:	Extreme VaR


The Extreme VaR functionality is now operational on the RaC website.  The te=
sting phase is completed, but ongoing calibration and fine-tuning will conti=
nue.  Extreme VaR represents a complement to Regular VaR, but concentrates o=
n the Extreme Tail regions.  The default shown on the screen is at 99.7%.
It can easily be set up for any portfolio of interest and at a user-specifie=
d confidence level.

The following document summarizes the procedure to invoke it from your websi=
tes.

Let me know if you have any questions.
