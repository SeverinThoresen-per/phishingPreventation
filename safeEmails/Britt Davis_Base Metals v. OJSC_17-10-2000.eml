PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:   ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT

Gentlemen:

You will shortly receive two proposed documents:  a letter from MG Metals to=
=20
the Court, agreeing that quasi-in-rem jurisdiction exists for the time being=
,=20
to the extent (and only to the extent) of the funds currently in the escrow=20
account, and a proposed order for the Court to sign, which vacates the escro=
w=20
account and gives you the right to immediate possession of the funds in that=
=20
account.  Please let me have your authority by close of business tomorrow in=
=20
London to send these drafts to opposing counsel, in order to comply with the=
=20
Court's time-table.  I will be in the office the rest of the afternoon, but=20
will likely not be in tomorrow until around 10:00 a.m. Houston time, given a=
=20
doctor's appointment early in the a.m.

I and our outside counsel (including Mark Gately, who is no longer with Mile=
s=20
& Stockbridge, but who participated in the telephone conference with the=20
Court yesterday), recommend that you authorize us to send these drafts to=20
opposing counsel immediately, as we were instructed to do by the Court.  If=20
we cannot reach an agreement on the language of these two documents with=20
opposing counsel, we will file them with the Court by the end of the week,=20
with the comment that we were unable to reach such an agreement.

In our view, the Court is doing all this in order to force Base Metals to pu=
t=20
up or shut up.  At the telephone conference yesterday, the Court made clear=20
it thought MG Metals was solvent and thought little of the objections Base=20
Metals had raised to our previously-filed proof of such solvency.  However,=20
before ordering the escrow account dissolved, the Court wanted to give Base=20
Metals some time (and we anticipate that it will be not more than about 10-2=
0=20
days) to file a suit directly against MG Metals in this Court if MG Metals=20
thought it had the facts to do so; hence, the request by the Court for a=20
letter from us regarding MG Metals' amenability to quasi-in-rem jurisdiction=
,=20
at least until the escrow account is dissolved.  In so many words, the Court=
=20
made clear to us that we better be sending such a letter if we wanted the=20
Court's cooperation in getting the escrow account dissolved quickly.

The proposed letter to the Court does not, in our view, agree to anything=20
that is not already true as a matter of law.  It stops short of saying that=20
there is no quasi-in-rem jurisdiction after the escrow account is vacated;=20
however, either there is or is not, depending on the law, so again, we are=20
not giving up anything.  My sense is that if Base Metals for some reason=20
waits until after the escrow agreement is vacated to file suit directly=20
against MG Metals in this Court, the Court will not be pleased.  I also thin=
k=20
that this Court already thinks more of us than Base Metals, and I would not=20
be unhappy to have to litigate in this Court.

I await your response.

Britt
