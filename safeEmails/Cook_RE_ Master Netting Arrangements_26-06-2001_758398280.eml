As noted in the "checklist" for the draft master netting form, the current f=
orm of the document does not include any crossborder issues/review, but just=
 highlights the issue.  The master netting arrangements crossborder would ne=
ed to be scrubbed for insolvency/preference/safe harbor etc. rules, as well =
as tax matters.  We were able to get comfortable to cross into Canada on the=
 PGE transactions, but there were extra matters that had to be handled in re=
spect of Canada/US tax issues.  I cannot offhand remember the resolution.  S=
uffice to say, if the credit benefit warrants an aggregation of contracts cr=
ossborder, then due diligence for legal and tax would need to be undertaken.=
  ISDA opinions may be helpful, or at least a place to begin.

(Mark, now there is no demarcation in Outlook to distinguish the Mark Taylor=

Mary:
Looks like credit wants to begin putting in place Master Netting Agreements =
with some of our major counterparties.  In most cases, we will be dealing wi=
th multiple entities on both sides that are organized in the US, UK an Canad=
a.  Assuming that all of these entities have entered into Master Agreements,=
 how comfortable should we be in including all of the entities under one Mas=
ter Netting Agreement?  Are there consideration, preference etc. issues that=
 we need to be concerned about and has our outside counsel analyzed this for=
 us?  Would we be better off grouping all of the US entities under one and d=
oing the same for the Canadian and UK entities?

I would appreciate hearing from anyone that may have some thoughts about thi=
s as credit would like for these to be [put in place by the end of the 3rd q=
uarter.  Thanks.
