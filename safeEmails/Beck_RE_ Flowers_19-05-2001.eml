Thanks for the details on the flowers.  That should be enough for us to prod=
uce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer. =20

David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called=
=2E  Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the t=
ime. =20

We really enjoyed your visit as well!  Thanks for supporting Amanda in her m=
usical efforts.  --Sally  =20

Sally, I called last night and talked to David briefly, as I was going to =20
give you the information on Dad's and my flowers in our wedding.  We think =20
that Dad had a red carnation in his lapel-no color, so that is what we =20
guessed.  Here is the description of my bouquet.  "She carried a formal =20
bouquet of white orchids  encircled with lillies of the valley with tiny =20
satin ribbon showers."  Primarily one sees the baby orchids iin the black an=
d =20
white picture.=20
We surely had enjoyed our visit with all of you.=20
Love,=20
Mom=20
