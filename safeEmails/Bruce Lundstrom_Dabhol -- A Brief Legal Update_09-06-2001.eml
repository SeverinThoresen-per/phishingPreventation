Gentlemen -

A few brief updates:

The hearing before the Bombay High Court regarding MERC jurisdiction is stil=
l=20
on for Monday.  We are still not sure whether or not there will be anything=20
substantive discussed at the hearing.  Gail Brownfeld and Christopher Walker=
=20
are flying to Bombay just in case.  I just spoke with Jim McCartney and he i=
s=20
planning to try to attend as well. =20

There was no unified "message" from the lenders at the conclusion of the=20
Singapore lenders meetings.  Our Finance guys are pretty confident that the=20
offshore lenders will not cure the construction contract defaults this=20
month.  The Indian banks may or may not cure.  If no one cures, the=20
construction contracts will terminate in mid-June.=20

We received a copy of a very interesting letter from the Chairman of MSEB to=
=20
the India Central Electricity Authority and copied to GOM dated January 11,=20
2001 (less than three weeks before we were first accused of misdeclaring). =20
The Chairman states: =20

"The high price of Dabhol power today was perhaps not accurately anticipated=
=2E=20
=2E . .DPC Phase II trial runs are to commence shortly. . . .It is a fact th=
at=20
we have not been able to fully absorb even DPC phase I power at 90% PLF. . .=
=20
=2E[O]nly on MSEB projections and certification DPC have invested a huge sum=
 in=20
Phase II.  Can we ask them to stop now?  Poor off-takes of DPC power are not=
=20
just because of low demand, but also on account of the high price and the=20
poor financial condition of MSEB.  We would be grateful for Government advic=
e=20
in the matter."

It appears to me that the "advice" was to charge that DPC was misdeclaring=20
its availability and to demand huge offsets as a result.
