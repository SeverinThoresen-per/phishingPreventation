Nicole and Bob:

 I have had some preliminary legal research done on whether Enron Metals has=
=20
a pre-litigation duty to contest the various allegedly unpaid bills received=
=20
from the various ICTS-related carriers, in order to preserve its legal=20
defenses if litigation is filed by one or more of those carriers.  It does=20
appear that in order to preserve its right to contest these bills in a later=
=20
legal proceeding, Enron Metals should send a notice in writing to each of th=
e=20
carriers who have sent it unpaid bills, simply stating that Enron Metals=20
contests them.  This should be done such that the carrier receives the notic=
e=20
of contest within 180 days after MG Metals has received the unpaid bill.=20
Telefax appears to be a legally sufficient means of communicating this=20
notice. =20

 However, this is not the end of the strategy consideration.  It also appear=
s=20
from our preliminary legal research that Enron Metals may in fact be=20
secondarily liable for the unpaid bills, even if Enron Metals already paid i=
n=20
full in advance to ICTS, its shipping agent.  This may apply even if ICTS=20
mistakenly failed to request sufficient payment from Enron Metals to begin=20
with; i.e, a situation where ICTS thought it could get a carrier to transpor=
t=20
a load for $100, and asked for and received $100 in payment from Enron=20
Metals, but had to agree to pay $150 to get the load transported.  Last, I=20
believe Bob mentioned that there are in fact unpaid carrier's bills for whic=
h=20
Enron Metals has not paid ICTS at all, given the realistic fear that once=20
ICTS has Enron Metals' money, that money may not get repaid to the carrier.

 In other words, assuming that the bills are in fact factually accurate, wer=
e=20
timely billed, and were accurately calculated using the applicable tariff=20
rates (all of which may be important potential defenses that I have not=20
investigated), then Enron Metals may not have any legal defenses, and sendin=
g=20
the 180 day notice to the carriers may ultimately do nothing to help Enron=20
Metals if the carrier elects to file some legal action.  Worse, if Enron=20
Metals has not already sent out such letters, doing so now may attract=20
attention by these carriers, who otherwise may have back-burnered these=20
claims.  On the other hand, sending such letters may (and I repeat, may)=20
deter some of the carriers, if the carriers are aware of substantial problem=
s=20
with their bills. =20

I will have my secretary, Deborah Shahmoradi, call each of you to arrange fo=
r=20
a telephone conference for tomorrow or Monday to discuss this.=20

Britt

P.S.--Richard, this is just FYI; you don't need to be in on the telephone=20
conference.
