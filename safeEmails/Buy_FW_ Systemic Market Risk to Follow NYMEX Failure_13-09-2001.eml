Rick:=20
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned ab=
out the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX=
=2E A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried=
 that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow=
=2E  In this scenario, Enron=B4s large NYMEX position could put it in jeopra=
rdy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX cle=
aring falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYM=
EX payment performance?????
