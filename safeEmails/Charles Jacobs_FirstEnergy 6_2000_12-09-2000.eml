Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick=20
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found=20
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  W=
e=20
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deal=
s=20
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007=20
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes=
=20
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come=20
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in=20
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us=20
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where=20
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an=
=20
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be=
=20
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he go=
t=20
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two=20
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 =3D 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me=20
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you=20
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that'=
s=20
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon=20
would be convenient for you.

Thanks,
=2E..Chuck
