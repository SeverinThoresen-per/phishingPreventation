     As many of you know, I have been working at the Enron Body Shop since t=
he fall of 1991.  Way back then, I was fresh out of college with lots of ide=
as and no experience.  But working here has given me more experiences than I=
 could ever have imagined!  I truly believe that it has helped make me the s=
trong, confident, successful woman I am today.  As Enron has high expectatio=
ns of you, its' employees, so did you have high expectations for me at the B=
ody Shop.  For these past 10 years, I have strived to meet and surpass these=
 expectations.  I'll never forget those first classes I taught here when my =
group exercise teaching skills still needed a little "fine-tuning"? okay, a =
lot!    As I watched some of you pick up your benches and stomp away long be=
fore class was over, I vowed to one day be one of the best instructors you h=
ave ever had.  In this, and many other ways, you have inspired me to greater=
 heights in my career and life. =20
     Now it is time for me to seek new challenges.  Last Thursday, I accepte=
d a position as manager of a fitness center of my own.  My last day at the E=
nron Body Shop will be Thursday February 1st.  Although I am looking forward=
 to the changes and new challenges, I will always look back at the Body Shop=
 with so many fond memories and good feelings.  But most of all, I will miss=
 you, my favorite members!  And although you have all been "challenging' and=
? well? downright demanding at times , I am so proud to have had the pleasur=
e of knowing and working with each and every one of you.  You are all such i=
mpressive individuals with a dedication to fitness that I do so admire.  Sta=
y healthy and live long happy lives!  I feel so satisfied knowing that the p=
rograms and expertise I am leaving behind will help you all to do so. =20
May God's richest blessings fall upon you today and every day!
Sincerely,
Ann Patrice Mora
