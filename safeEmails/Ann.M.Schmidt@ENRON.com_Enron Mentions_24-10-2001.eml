Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or mo=
re during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment veh=
icles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional =
Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.=20
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the =
company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by =
those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. Th=
e notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- kn=
own as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osp=
rey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 mon=
ths.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of th=
e notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactio=
ns also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed =
by Enron.=20
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the =
end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from t=
he previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility un=
it. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002.=20
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceed=
s" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue =
equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much=
 as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstand=
ing.=20
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the=
 drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite tr=
ading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again o=
ne of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. =
Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.=20
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more t=
han 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, =
resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.=
2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of ter=
minating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was h=
eaded by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow=
 ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by =
analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities=
 and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fa=
stow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference=
 call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to=
 reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said whi=
le "we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses =
are performing very well." Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequ=
ate liquidity to meet its needs.=20
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. B=
ut neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-r=
elated partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said t=
he SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangemen=
t, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others=
=2E Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to =
discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was "very concerned about=
 the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about." He added "we conti=
nue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."=20
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fe=
llow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital=
 increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets=
 and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SE=
C filings.=20
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enr=
on fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement an=
d the company's often opaque financial reports. "There's the appearance you =
are hiding something," said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. "You need=
 to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealin=
gs are above board."=20
Mr. Lay responded, "We're trying to be as transparent as we can."

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday=
 as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs st=
emming from unusual financing activities.=20
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's=
 stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defe=
nded the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of=
 interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with par=
tnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition,=
 Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have suffic=
ient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any question=
s about it.=20
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stoc=
k Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of th=
e beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon bega=
n falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.=
62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high=
 set by the stock in the summer of 2000.=20
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating e=
arnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy m=
arkets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involvin=
g off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised c=
oncern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on M=
onday.=20
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analy=
st at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron h=
ad to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that yo=
u are hiding something,'' he said.=20
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in=
 a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to under=
stand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in exp=
laining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending =
the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total=
 shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at t=
his company, there is tremendous value here.''=20
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on=
 the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fas=
tow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to ha=
ve the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''=20
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron=
's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called M=
arlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns =
Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no =
write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highf=
ields Capital Management, a money management firm.=20
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guarant=
eed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enro=
n had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public sharehold=
ers and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman=
 asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on =
that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfie=
d through the issuance of Enron shares.=20
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Even=
tually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock pri=
ce down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let'=
s move on to the next question.''=20
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper a=
nd had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.3=
5 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next M=
ay if it is not renewed.=20
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when =
his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a c=
onference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction wo=
uld have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with th=
e earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releas=
ing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises=
=2E=20
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, =
and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of =
the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectiv=
ely keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to loo=
k into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.=20
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron=
 if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that w=
ere set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the compa=
ny ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by t=
he ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace st=
ock holdings and to ride any rallies.=20
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board =
Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-=
month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, o=
r VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely=
 watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity=
 put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session=
's end, the ratio was at 0.49.=20
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switc=
hing equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letc=
o, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of J=
anuary 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 share=
s of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock M=
arket trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell =
10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contrac=
ts traded at the Pacific Exchange.=20
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as t=
he energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their co=
ncerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is lookin=
g at the Houston company.=20
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to=
 sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and exp=
iration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich=
 premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller =
Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Sto=
ck Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an in=
vestor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of=
 buying stock.=20
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the=
 stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in ei=
ther direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddle=
s if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket pr=
emium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chi=

Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday.=20
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over=
 Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, =
LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and h=
edging arrangements with Enron.=20
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an=
 "informal inquiry" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships=
=2E=20
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions.=20
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday i=
t dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79.=20
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Stree=
t that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and =
that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performa=
nce.=20
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for i=
nvestors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns.=20
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questi=
ons during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credib=
ility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in hi=
s power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard.=20
"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand=
 and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions," he said.=20
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships becau=
se of the SEC inquiry.=20
He did say Enron was aware an "inherent conflict of interest" would result f=
rom its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing busine=
ss with Enron.=20
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followe=
d, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised.=20
"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron," he said, adding that Enron=
 wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was i=
n Enron's best interest.=20
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the "highest faith and confidence" in=
 Fastow, he added.=20
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from=
 Wall Street.=20
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships.=20
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' =
equity by $1.2 billion as a result.=20
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues.=20
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to =
carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles,=
 Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest i=
n certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the inv=
estments.=20
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commi=
tments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that wou=
ld cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who fol=
lows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some =
new information about Enron's lines of credit.=20
"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call," he said.=20

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the compa=
ny thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicl=
es it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal re=
ported in its online edition on Wednesday.=20
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those =
investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby =
diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were=
 sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming du=
e during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trus=
t II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, =
the report said.=20
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sol=
d to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report sa=
id. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward re=
paying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron.=20
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise a=
t least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002.=20
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceed=
s" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. "But if we are =
wrong, we will issue equity."=20
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve iss=
uing as much as $1 billion in stock.=20
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concern=

he company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billio=

Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesti=

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient marke=
t largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements.=20
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the comp=
any issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but al=
so issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors res=
ponded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb,=
 for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1=
=2E40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38=
=2E17.=20
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in re=
action to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50=
, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25.=20
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after i=
ts third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from s=
everal analysts.=20

 eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."=20
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices rec=

Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices h=

Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated cir=

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG ind=
ustry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a cris=
is of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn.=20
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of =
the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand,=
 which might emerge later than scheduled.
"The issue is timing," Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based inve=
stment bank First Securities told Reuters.=20
"Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about si=
x months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"=
 he added.=20
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen =
by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairp=
lay.=20
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of =
the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a shar=
p fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year.=20
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen,=
 said that a sustained economic downturn could have "consequences."=20
"I wouldn't be surprised by project delays," he told Reuters. "This could re=
sult in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."=20
"I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic =
than before," he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of wh=
ich have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas.=20
STOP AND THINK=20
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historical=
ly bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the pro=
blem.=20
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under=
 construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have =
firm future employment.=20
"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and th=
e amount of ships ordered," Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters,=
 "The only risk is things might be delayed."=20
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it wa=
s also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of the=
m.=20
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditi=
onal approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little a=
s possible to chance.=20
"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under off=
er for the (Qatari) RasGas tender," Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told R=
euters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron.=20
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agr=
eements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship or=
ders.=20
"It's a good time to wait," said Saverys.

BG Offers ONGC Brazilian Assets to Get Managing Rights in India
2001-10-24 01:12 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- BG Group Plc has offered Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. a stake in exploration projects in Brazil if
India's biggest oil producer allows BG to run the oil fields it
bought from Enron Corp. in India, the Economic Times reported,
without citing any officials.

     BG's purchase of Enron's 30 percent stake in the three oil
and gas areas in India is contingent on winning the right to
manage the developments. Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70
percent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to
run the oil and gas fields.

     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator
after Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites
in Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian
interests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to
resolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.

     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in
the Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63
percent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The
assets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
partners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest
refiner, Indian Oil Corp.


House stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats =
present alternative
By CURT ANDERSON
AP Tax Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that =
would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House =
Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous t=
o companies and does too little for individuals.=20
Seven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative =
minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legisl=
ation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum inco=
me tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions a=
nd credits.
IBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressio=
nal Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million an=
d General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include en=
ergy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chai=
n Kroger, $9 million.=20
In addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that cou=
ld total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million.=20
Counting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in =
tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the=
 bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firm=
s doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief=
 over 10 years.=20
The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in th=
e House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the=
 measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administr=
ation also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly.=20
"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is," said Sen. John =
Breaux, D-La.=20
For individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate ch=
ecks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27=
 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than unde=
r the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates fro=
m 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment w=
rite-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid f=
ive years earlier.=20
The primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in =
a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislatio=
n "is a shot of adrenaline" that will help restart the economy while not tri=
ggering inflation.=20
"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy," wrote=
 Thomas, R-Calif.=20
While bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats hav=
e been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who l=
ose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Commit=
tee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment=
 benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health i=
nsurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid.=20
The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar =
to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative min=
imum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2=
002, far below the House GOP level.=20
"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this=
 nation get back to work and recover quickly," said Baucus, D-Mont.=20
Other Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Com=
mittee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 bil=
lion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food i=
nspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccine=
s.=20
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulu=
s bill laden with additional spending.=20
"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative," Grassley said. "There =
needs to be more done on the investment side."=20
