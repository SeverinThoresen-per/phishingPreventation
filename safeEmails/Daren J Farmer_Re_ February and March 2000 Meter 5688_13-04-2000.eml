Daren,

Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I=
=20
was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL. =20
This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch.

Thanks

Jackie:

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract=20
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert=20
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily=20
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and=20
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Fred
