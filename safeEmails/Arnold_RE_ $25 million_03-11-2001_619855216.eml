We just finished doing the xpit that they asked for.  They have agreed to se=
nd the money immediately after that was done.  We should be getting the mone=
y very soon.  Hold off on the letter right now.

Legal drafted a letter demanding that EDF return the $25 million they withhe=
ld this morning.  I want to send it to EDF to preserve our rights under the =
customer agreement and to discourage them from this behaviour in the future.=

Did you ever hear back whether EDF was going to send this to you if you move=
d the short 1660 May 2002 futures positions?  If you have already resolved t=
he matter and gotten EDF to agree to return the money, I might hold off on s=
ending this.  Sarah
