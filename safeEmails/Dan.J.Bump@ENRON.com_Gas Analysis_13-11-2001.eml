Could you find out if Patina has performed a gas analysis on the zone to be =
completed at your new well.  If/when you receive a gas analysis, our operati=
ons guys like to review this data for all new interconnects (obviously, this=
 information is kept confidential).

Thanks. =20

he first half of December), let's get together with Mark Whitt to discuss an=
d coordinate gathering and marketing strategies.
