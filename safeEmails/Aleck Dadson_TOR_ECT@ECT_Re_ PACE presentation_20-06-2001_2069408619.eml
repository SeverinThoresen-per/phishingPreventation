  Re: PACE presentation=09




Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
=20
                         a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a "native load" preference).
=20
                              b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering  lets say  $1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external  load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will    be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
=20
                                                                  c)
Remember also that the scope for  economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff  ($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately  $4  MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh),  plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
=20
                                                                  d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost).  Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.)  Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners.  (In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
=20
                                                                  Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE.  Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck:  Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
=20
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south.  As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power.  However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated.  If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below).  Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance.  Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
=20
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market.  Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening.  Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
=20
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
=20
Thanks,
=20
Dave
