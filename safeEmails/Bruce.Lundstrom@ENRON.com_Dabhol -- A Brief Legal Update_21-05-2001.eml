Gentlemen -

On Saturday, we received the consent required from the lenders to serve Prel=
iminary Termination Notices (PTNs) on MSEB under the PPA.  The consent allow=
s us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian count=
erparts to date.  We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for fut=
ure bad acts.

On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts u=
nder the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA.  There are a few more P=
TNs that will be served on MSEB in early June -- the underlying defaults for=
 these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and thes=
e notices were served in early April.

Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he receiv=
es 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his apartment.  On=
 Sunday, our service of the PTNs was the lead story in all 4 newspapers.

Bruce
