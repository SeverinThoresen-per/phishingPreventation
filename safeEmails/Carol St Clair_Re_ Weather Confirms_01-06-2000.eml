I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of ou=
r=20
confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather=20
Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and=20
have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/=
=20
him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording.=20

One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have=20
included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in=
=20
mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special=20
wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of=20
confirmation.=20

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten th=
e=20
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master t=
o=20
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is=20
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Sara and Jason:
Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather=20
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could=20
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used=
=20
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would=20
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already=
=20
set forth in the Master?
