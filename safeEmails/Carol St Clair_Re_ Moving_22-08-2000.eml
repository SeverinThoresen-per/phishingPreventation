I don't know what's going on!  I keep hearing different days.  I've got a=20
voice mail into Mark Taylor now.  I wish they would hurry up and get their=20
act straightened out. =20

You've got an Ansel Adams photograph up here with a card.  Must be a gift. =20
Do you want it up here or at home.  It's wonderful.  Are you familiar with=20
Ansel Adams?  He took black and white photographs of Yosemite in California.=
 =20
This probably cost a pretty penny.  I'll take if if you don't want it.  haha

I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us tha=

the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase=20
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August=20
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully=20
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for you=

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of=20
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that. =20

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How=20
are you doing?
