Jon, can't say it on the desk in front of  Matt.  I had nothing to do with t=
hat trade.  I cover your line so I  had to make the call.  I am not out here=
 taking garbage about Enron or  anything like that.  That's why I called Bri=
an in London to call you.   Please beleive me.  That was arranged between th=
em.  I work neither  Phibro or EKoch.
