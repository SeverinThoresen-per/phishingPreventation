Subject: Beginning Hang Gliding

I don't want anyone to feel left out and please let me know if you don't wan=
t=20
to see emails of this type in the future.  There is a beginning hang gliding=
=20
class this weekend.  The class is offered through Leisure Learning=20
Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, clic=
k=20
on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll=
=20
down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out=
=20
more.

Here is the schedule;
Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th &=20
5th.

The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The=20
outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere.

Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending=
=20
on which option you select.

Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up!
