When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balan=
cing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposal=
s.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure =
that I understand what is involved in complying.

In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern=
 is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB =
rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense =
of having different posting formats for our different pipes.=20
"Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting format=
s on its electronic bulletin board,
consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. "=20

Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?
