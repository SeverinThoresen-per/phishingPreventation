SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Here is a line of argument which we might consider using to muzzle the PX. =20


1. Section  19.3.1 of the Tariff  requires the PX to keep  sensitive=20
information given to the PX by Participants Confidential. =20

2. Section 19.3.3 says no PX Participant has the right to review any  ....=20
information... that another PX Participant  has designated as confidential. =
=20

3.  Section 19.3.4 says that if the PX thinks it has to disclose=20
information,  it has to let the Participant that will be affected by the=20
disclosure have time to challenge the alleged disclosure requirement.

4. PX Tariff Schedule 10  (Dealing with Sanctions)  says that the terms of=20
Section 19 apply in Sanction situations. =20

 5.  Schedule 10 is silent about whether or not the PX is required or=20
permitted to broadcast Sanctions to the market. =20

There may be a legal argument based on the Tariff  that the PX has to keep=20
quiet about sanctions.  Are they required or permitted to broadcast to the=20
whole world their  findings?  =20

Another line of reasoning based on the Tariff which might be worth exploring=
 =20
is as follows:   if this event had occurred now,  with the new sanction part=
=20
of the  tariff in effect, the PX would have had to have conducted an=20
investigation in accordance with Section 5.4 which requires the basis of a=20
finding to be given and, if after this relatively  fair looking due process=20
section was followed, we were found guilty,   we would have received a Level=
=20
1 Sanction,  which is a Formal Warning which "shall take the form of a=20
written letter identifying the PX Participant's infraction. "   and nothing=20
more.  Therefore,  why is the PX seeking to solve a problem it had before th=
e=20
Tariff was brought up to date  on Sanctions with a  Kangaroo Court process =20
that is more draconian than its newly approved FERC sanctions?   It is rathe=
r=20
ironic that we have escaped sanctions because they were't organized to impos=
e=20
them when the actions in question occurred, but had the present Tariff been=20
in effect then, we probably would not have been treated so shabbily.  Someho=
w=20
this has to be able to be turned into a legal argument in our defence. ---cg=
y

These are preliminary thoughts which I think merit further pursuit. =20
---cgy   =20
