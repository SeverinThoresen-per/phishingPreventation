Here is information taken from the City's website.   From my interpretation,=
 MWBE participate is a consideration and encouraged, but not necessarily req=
uired. =20

 Request for Proposals (RFPs) - Request for Proposals are used to solicit eq=
uipment, goods, and services of a highly technical nature.=20
RFPs are taken in accordance with State law provision under Vernon's Annotat=
ed Civil Statutes (V.A.C.S. =A7 252), which is a unit of the Texas Legislati=
ve Council's statutory revision program authorized by the Texas Local Govern=
ment Code. As an example, the City will solicit requests for proposals for i=
nformation processing equipment, software and hardware used in conjunction w=
ith information processing equipment, telecommunications, radio and microwav=
e systems, electronic distributed control systems and technical services rel=
ated to this equipment. RFPs are also reviewed for MWBE opportunities.
Formal Bids - Written solicitations exceeding $15,000 for goods and nonprofe=
ssional services.=20
These bids are taken in accordance with State law. Bids are advertised for t=
wo consecutive weeks in the Houston Business Journal and minority papers, th=
en received by the City Secretary's Office on the advertised bid due date, o=
pened and publicly read in the City Council Chambers (unless place of openin=
g has been transferred in accordance with Section 15-3 B(5) of the City of H=
ouston Code of Ordinances.) The City Purchasing Agent recommends awards for =
formal bids to City Council. Prior to issuing a bid invitation estimated to =
be in excess of $100,000, Strategic Purchasing reviews and researches each f=
or the purpose of determining subcontracting possibilities. When it is evide=
nt there is MWBE subcontracting potential, a goal is assigned to give certif=
ied MWBE suppliers additional opportunity to participate in City business.

Construction - Projects involving improvement to City facilities amounting t=
o $500,000 or less.=20
Sealed bids are taken in accordance with State law for various construction =
projects amounting to $500,000 or less. Bid Bonds are required on all Constr=
uction Projects. Projects exceeding $25,000 require bidders to submit a paym=
ent bond and those exceeding $100,000 require a payment and performance bond=
=2E The City Purchasing Agent recommends award of contracts to City Council.=
 Certified MWBE's are encouraged to bid as prime contractors.
