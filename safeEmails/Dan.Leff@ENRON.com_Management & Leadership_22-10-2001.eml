Ken, Greg, Mark -=20

Thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and this morning. =
 We appreciate it.

Following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments f=
rom this morning:

The leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility =
to lead our businesses.  Everything we say & do - including all written, ver=
bal and "body language" - are signals.  We must communicate and lead all day=
, every day. =20
As an organization, and as part of our culture, we lead with our chin - alwa=
ys have and probably always will.  We are going to take our share of bumps a=
nd bruises.
We have some great businesses here....and we are fortunate.  We have grown t=
he size and profitability of our core businesses substantially, and in a mar=
ket where many companies have not been as successful.
Most of our wounds are self - inflicted.  We can and should do a better job.
I believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the f=
ollowing areas:
Vision -  define what we want this company to be in the next 3-5 years
Value -    as part of building the World's Leading Company, my vote is that =
we dedicate our energy towards building long term, sustainable value.  This =
is not about just creating value in the eyes of Wall Street - this is about =
creating real value, perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus=
 the real cost of capital".  Market cap will follow this type of economic va=
lue creation.  We need to measure it and incent people this way.
Teamwork - we are a leadership team.  I don't feel as though everyone buys i=
nto that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of re=
sponsibility to lead across the business.  I would like to discuss how we im=
prove as a team.  Many of our employees (at an average age of 33 years) have=
 never been through:=20
an economic downturn
a global military conflict
problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at Enron
We need big time leadership now....from all who are around that table
Clear Demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees, cust=
omers and shareholders
People - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employe=
es that add value to Enron everyday.  These people need to believe - with ou=
r actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an envir=
onment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short, medi=
um and long term.
The ball is in our court.  We have to lead and be perceived as credible lead=
ers.  We've got to dig deep and get down the road - together.

If you wish, I would be pleased to discuss this further.

Thank you again for your leadership. =20

Regards - Dan
