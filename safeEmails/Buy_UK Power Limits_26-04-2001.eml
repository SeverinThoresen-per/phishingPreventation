We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board =
for approval. I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don=
't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limi=
t can add to the danger. My understanding is that there is an IT and backoff=
ice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to =
complete. Please keep the pressure on over there to get the infrastructure w=
here it needs to be. Thanks, Rick
