I have just spoken with my lawyer.  Basically, USVI does not work.  I could
be easily "carded" on the way back in.  Apparently, it is well tried and
therefore well patrolled way of entry into the US.

We are going to try and get INS to speed the process, but basically I am in
a difficult position.  I no longer have the first job under which the first
application was submitted, so I cannot call and say I need the travel permit
for business reasons, and although my cheques have been cashed (I think) the
travel permit is delayed somewhere.  I have no news at all on the second
application.

Do you know of anyone that you may want to take along instead?  One or two
spots going....whichever is easiest to fill.
