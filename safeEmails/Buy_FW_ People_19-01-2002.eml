Janet - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not goi=
ng to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMah=
on about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to co=
ntinue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function wi=
th RAC as well (to be determined more definitively).=20

Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have=
 which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his fl=
oor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit fi=
les on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that r=
equire large secure space.

My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my =
situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and g=
et remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone i=
s looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people.=20

I hope this addresses your issue.

Rick

Hi Rick. Hope your holding up. We are going to have all of the "on-going con=
cern" activities here in the old building on the 30-31-32 floors. We will be=
 splitting the estate infrastructure into two functions: on-going activities=
 (contracts/assets we will continue to serve and perform under) and wind-up/=
liquidation activities. Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and =
I believe he is staying in the new building for now.

We need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the=
 on-going concern function. I'd prefer that we continue to have them located=
 near our floors vs. move to another location (as I hear through the grapevi=
ne). Could you suggest the folks that would be available to focus exclusivel=
y on on-going concern activities, and do you want them to stay on the 28th f=
loor or move onto 31 with us?

Thanks.
