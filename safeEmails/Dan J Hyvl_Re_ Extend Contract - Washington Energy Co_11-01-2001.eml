Bridgette,
 To the best of my knowledge, we are not working on a contract with=20
Washington Energy.  Has anyone asked the gas trader assigned to that account=
=20
about any contract drafts that the gas trader may have received and not=20
forwarded to legal. =20

Jeanne,

As I explained to Terry on Monday or Tuesday, according to the notes within=20
Global Contracts database, K#96030149 is an unexecuted contract and it=20
currently has a status of expired .  Because of these factors, we suggested=20
that the deal be re-entered and a GTC attached to it until a contract can be=
=20
negotiated and executed. =20

Unfortunately Global Contracts database is inoperative this morning so I=20
cannot give you any further information regarding any other notes for that=20
particular K#.  Please let me know if the suggestion that has been made is=20
feasible.=20

Dan- to the best of your knowledge, has there or will there be a contract=20
drafted for Washington Energy?

Regards,
Bridgette

Bridgette  -    Please extend global contract #96030149  with Washington=20

Thanks.

Extend the deal as a month to month ( that would be the default of the=20
assigned CES contract).  Price is 100% CGas Appalachian Index (no fixed=20
price).  Gathering stays the same.

one:

The deal ticket (#226330)  for Washington Energy Company for purchases from=20
meters 602368 and 602467 on CGAS was only set up through 10/31/00.    It had=

still purchasing this gas in November ?   What is the pricing structure=20
?      I was reluctant to have Global contracts extend the existing contract=

with the fixed price without your approval.

Please let me know via email what the terms of this purchase deal should be=20

If you need to call me,  I am still working from home   281-286-7153     ( I=
