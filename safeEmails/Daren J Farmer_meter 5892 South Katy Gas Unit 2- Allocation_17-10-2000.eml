Daren---

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error. =20
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due t=
o=20
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o=
=20
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the=20
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not ou=
t=20
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if=20
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Mark

t=20
of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper!
