The meeting with Enron on April 6 will be by conference call at 8:30 am
Pacific time, 10:30 am Central time.  The agenda will be approximately what
has been distributed previously.  This format will permit Kim to include
several of her colleagues in the meeting, and will give CalPeak more time to
establish the appropriate credit relationships.

The call-in numbers are:

1-888-550-5969
Access code: 140108 followed by the pound sign

If there are any problems getting into the call, phone the CalPeak number
shown at the top of the agenda, which is 619-239-1212, or my mobile phone
503-539-4022.
