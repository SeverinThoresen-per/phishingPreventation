Kevin,

Good summary!

I think in addition to putting together the three cases as you discussed=20
below, I
think we may also want / need to show how the FJ's "savings target" that the=
y=20
told
us we had to meet was constantly changing over the two years (from $100k=20
annually
to $225k to $500k to $1mm then my latest project from $1.5-2mm).  I think th=
is
correlates to what you are depicting in the cases.  It almost appears=20
everytime we
had a potential project which may be able to reach X dollars in savings to F=
J=20
they
would raise it.

Please provide questions or comments.  Thanks.

Regards,
David Barr
