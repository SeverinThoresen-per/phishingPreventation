Subject:	Clean Sweep today

Gas Structuring is starting its "Clean Sweep" process today at 3:00 PM on th=
e 32nd floor.  Clean Sweep is the process that the move coordinators have in=
stituted to eliminate unnecessary storage of outdated material in the new bu=
ilding.  So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM today=
 and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an urgent =
matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get to us=
 in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this notice=
 to the persons on your respective teams.  If you have any questions, please=
 ask. =20
Thanks,
Ed

PS  The move "regulators" are reported to be providing refreshments and snac=
ks for this event.  As such, we are seeking proposals to "pass through" thes=
e "incentives" to any person or persons who would like to "outsource" our sw=
eep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We reserv=
e to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may not neg=
otiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All sweep out=
sourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any change in mo=
ve regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoyed by Gas=
 Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Structuring wh=
ole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will be governe=
d by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(ies) our co=
ntract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes to the cont=
ract will be allowed since the move regulators have already approved the agr=
eement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or number of files t=
o be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the size or number of=
 files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity of snacks and ot=
her such data from public sources.  We will accept cash above all other form=
s of consideration.     =20
