401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are=20
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to=20
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enro=
n=20
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these=20
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay=
=20
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you=20
leave.=20

Does this help?

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was=20
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the=20
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. =
I=20
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I=20
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a=20
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in=
=20
advance for your time.

Kate
