Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Ga=
s Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be with=
drawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me th=
eir confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 200=
1.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 =
US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that M=
arch withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee=
 but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able=
 to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that=20

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business w=
ith in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will=20
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas an=
d doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are th=
ere any special tax issues to address?
