Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at=
=20
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example=20
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay=20
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed=20
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for=20
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a=20
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn=20
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is=20
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would=20
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow. =20
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have=
=20
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.=20
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum=20
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of=20
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and=20
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take=20
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the=20
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,=20
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.
