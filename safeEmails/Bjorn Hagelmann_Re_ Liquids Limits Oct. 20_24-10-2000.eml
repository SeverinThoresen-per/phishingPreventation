show the risk in the books. At this point and time it can be derived, but=20
only if you know what to look for. I would appreciate if you had some time t=

looking at these numbers i think the VAR model must be waaaaaaaaaay over=20
calcing something, most likely the spreads. the net and outright product=20
position are negligible. Seems it would take one hell of a daily move to=20
