in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create=20
some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect t=
o=20
our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we=
,=20
for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC? =
=20
Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial=20
transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just=
=20
didn't know how extensive they were.
