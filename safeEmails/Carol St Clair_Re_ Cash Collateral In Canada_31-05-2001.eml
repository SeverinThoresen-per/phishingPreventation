		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral In Canada

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T.=20
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes=
=20
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not=20
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although=20
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including=20
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by=20
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a=20
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although=20
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not=20
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinat=
e=20
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken=
=20
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this=
=20
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely=20
unknowingly).    =20

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at=20
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.=20

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for=20
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions=20
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the=20
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of=20
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registratio=
n=20
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance=20
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior=20
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,=20
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and=20
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. =20

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is als=
o=20
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit=20
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my=20
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has=20
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of,=
=20
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral=
=20
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash=
=20
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask=20
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?
