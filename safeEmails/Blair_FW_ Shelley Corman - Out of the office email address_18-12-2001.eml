        FYI.  Just to let you know, Shelley is trying to minimize emails she=
 gets to preserve space on her
        Blackberry.  But wanted to keep you in the loop in case you needed t=
o send her something.  Thanks. Lynn

Shelley requested that I send an email asking that you send all email corres=
pondence to her Compuserve email account while she is out of the office for =
the next couple of weeks.  Accessing her Compuserve account is much easier a=
nd faster than accessing mail.enron.com.
