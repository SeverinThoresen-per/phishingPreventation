Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Enterg=
y-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only pos=
itive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can se=
ll us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they =
will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, in=
forming their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise t=
o keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA o=
r 2) I've run out of customers to call.=20

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy =
gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't t=
hink PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell =
different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling the=
m first thing this morning. =20

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing g=
as for the weekend.=20

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply th=
e City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative bur=
den and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott=
 Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become ou=
r new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the f=
ollowing conditions,=20
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily v=
olumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify EN=
A until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.
