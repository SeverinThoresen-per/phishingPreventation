I think this works.  What is the best way to incorporate this into the plan?

Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will=
 accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be a=
dopted by the Committee.=20
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit =
under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance wi=
th the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed =
on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of emplo=
yment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the s=
everance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a ma=
nner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of=
 pay received by such employee during such period. =20
