Just between you and I, I think there may be an issue here of a couple perso=
nalities. We can't have that in your group or mine. I'll watch carefully.

On the subject of timing, we should probably have a standard to shoot for. T=
ime to read contract, run model, review results and communicate. I'll talk t=
o Bill about this.

On the issue of the hotline, we do not have everyone trained in running mode=
ls for EES deals. We are working on getting more people up to speed. Thanks,=
  Rick

Hey guys, I know we're all drinking from a firehouse here, but we've got to =
figure out how to streamline some of our processes.  I hear it's still takin=
g way too long to get our credit reserve numbers (i.e.- IBM- 2 1/2 days) and=
 it really is effecting our dealflow. People know about the credit hot line =
# but the consistent response is that the individuals that pick up this # ar=
e of varying experience levels and they still have to clear everything throu=
gh Denise anyway. Please help me on this.

Also, we have to verify our process around incorporating an evaluation on an=
 accounts receivable (late payment) for a customer when doing a credit check=
=2E Who is responsible for this now and how does this work within ENA for ex=
ample?

Let's talk on Monday. Thanks.
