I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a=
 good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calg=
ary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed com=
ponent and a transaction-based component. =20

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada,=
 West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in exc=
ess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappr=
opriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is mor=
e that generation/
