Not done - but good progress:

We reached agreement with the water bank late last night on the definitive a=
greement.  The members of the bank are going to their respective boards toda=
y and tomorrow and are saying that they are prepared to sign tomorrow.  They=
 have flaked on us in the past, so there is still a decent chance we dont ge=
t done soon, but in general we are pleased that they moved so quickly during=
 the past week.

Calpine started being difficult yesterday re the timing of closing, water (t=
hey now want the Azurix agreement with a guarantee) and taking the gas trans=
port.  We played hardball - told them Azurix is out and that we dont need th=
e transport.  The outcome of that position is that we will not assign our tr=
ansport to them and we will opt out of our transport precedent agreement.  C=
alpine indicated that they have their own transport and if we dont close, th=
ey would assign us 50MMCF/Day.  I am not sure if this is their final answer =
but it is clearly better than them having a put back to us for 100MMCF/Day.

I suspect this will change - some for the bettter, some for the worse, but I=
 will keep you posted.

Chris
