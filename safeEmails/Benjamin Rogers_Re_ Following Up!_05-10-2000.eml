 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U=20
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer=20
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was th=
e=20
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at =
U=20
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business=20
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there. =20
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben=20
