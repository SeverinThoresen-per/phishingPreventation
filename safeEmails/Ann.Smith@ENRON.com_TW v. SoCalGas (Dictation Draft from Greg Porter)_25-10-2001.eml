DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC=
's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both par=
ties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) t=
hat both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  A=
fter discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.=
  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby par=
ties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlemen=
t) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Mil=
es will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating=
 discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without=
 resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, =
Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert=
 to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desi=
re, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend t=
he Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential da=
tes for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Onc=
e additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you=
 have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
