What the hell happened this weekend?  All I can say right now is thank you
to everybody who showed up and made this weekend one of the most fun
memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

- Bryan

ps  If anybody has seen my Carolina shirt, my cell phone charger, my
American Express card and/or my voice, please bring them to my wedding, too.
