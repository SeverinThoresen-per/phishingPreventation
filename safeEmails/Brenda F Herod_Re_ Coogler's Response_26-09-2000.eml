Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additiona=
l
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Rick

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all =
of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs=
=20
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers=
=20
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the=20
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though=20
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBT=
U.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas f=
or
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and a=
re
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will th=
e
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quit=
e
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any =
of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If=20
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone an=
d
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew
