Testing process began approx Feb 7th after the link was in:
They are able to login, get an weblogic session id, Request Prices, I have y=
et to see a Post Price request or Attempt Transaction.
Basically they are testing on receiving data back from us from their browser=
 or their scripted programs.


One issue on going is making a connection to their server, which would cause=
 an issue on Posting prices to their server.   We just received their server=
 connection info (IP address, ports etc..) yesterday, thus we should be able=
 to post prices to them once we complete our setup today.

 The product control group was very responsive with regards to answering bus=
iness questions from Linda Bradley@Houstonstreet.=20

If you need more detail let me know.  Hope this helps.
