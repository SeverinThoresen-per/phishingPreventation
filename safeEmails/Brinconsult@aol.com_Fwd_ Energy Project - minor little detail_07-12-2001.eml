Hi, Rick---If you don't mind, Lyn's asked that you join him at The Hyatt (am=
 thinking the bar might just come in handy)---in front of the escalator in t=
he lobby.  As I indicated, he's 6'3", has reddish hair, and is purported to =
be rather muscular.  Hope you're preparing a description for me---will call =
you shortly to confirm.  (He's aware that you're suitless---and the resume's=
 not even remotely an issue.)  Talk to you soon---thx!   mb
