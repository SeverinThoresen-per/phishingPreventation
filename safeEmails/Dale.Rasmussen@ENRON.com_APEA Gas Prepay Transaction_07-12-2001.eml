I have gotten a call from Roger Mock, CEO of American Public Energy Agency, =
regarding a series of transactions.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12=
-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery o=
bligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ,=
 NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal. =20

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State)=
, City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department=
 (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.=
  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt =
lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of t=
he documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifyi=
ng APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allow=
s for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be=
 better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious=
 to work out alternatives, if possible.=20

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.
