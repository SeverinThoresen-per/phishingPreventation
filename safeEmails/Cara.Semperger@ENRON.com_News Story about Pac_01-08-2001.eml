Utility Pushes Panel for Rate Hike in Utah=20

By Steven Oberbec, The Salt Lake Tribune -- July 31=20
PacifiCorp Chief Executive Judith Johansen on Monday told the Utah Public Se=
rvice Commission (PSC) her company was devastated by the Western power crisi=
s last year and needs a $118 million rate hike in Utah to help it return to =
financial health.=20
=09
Utah Power's parent company requested the rate increase in January and the P=
SC will hold hearings through Friday to consider the company's request.=20
PacifiCorp wants the $118 million -- about $7 per month for an average Utah =
customer -- to cover the millions it spent last year to buy electricity on t=
he wholesale market. The power was needed to meet its Utah customers' demand=
 during peak usage periods.=20
Johansen said PacifiCorp's power costs are almost double what it is allowed =
to charge its customers under existing rates. Without the increase, the comp=
any's credit rating may suffer.=20
Credit-rating companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poors "have a very ke=
en eye" on PacifiCorp rate cases in Utah and other Western states because th=
ey are concerned about the company's cash flow and overall liquidity, she sa=
id.=20
A decrease in PacifiCorp's credit rating could make it more difficult and ex=
pensive for the company to finance new power plant construction needed to me=
et the growing demand for electricity in its operating territory.=20
Yet throughout most of the past decade, PacifiCorp generated more power than=
 it needed to serve its residential customers. It sold the excess electricit=
y under long-term wholesale contracts.=20
Those long-term contracts benefited the company's customers to the tune of $=
1.3 billion over the past decade, said Stanley Watters, managing director of=
 wholesale energy services at PacifiCorp.=20
Critics, however, contend the company at the same time adopted a business st=
rategy to increase its wholesale power business and entered into long-term p=
ower supply contracts while relying on the spot market for the electricity.=20
The strategy worked until the spot-market price for electricity soared last =
summer when PacifiCorp suddenly got caught in the squeeze.=20
The question of who should pick up the tab for the company's wholesale power=
 strategy lies at the heart of the rate case now before the PSC.=20
"Their [wholesale] business strategy exposed ratepayers to enormous risk," s=
aid Dan Gimble, who serves on the staff of the Committee of Consumer Service=
s that represents residential energy users and small businesses in utility r=
ate cases.=20
PacifiCorp, though, contends it wholesale market strategy was prudent and be=
nefitted its retail customers by helping lower the cost of a kilowatt-hour o=
f electricity 30 percent from 1985 to 1999.=20
"Absent the high market prices we've seen, I don't think any of us would be =
here today," Watters said.=20
Utah Power's customers will be able to tell the PSC what they think of the c=
ompany's rate hike request at 5 p.m. Wednesday.=20
