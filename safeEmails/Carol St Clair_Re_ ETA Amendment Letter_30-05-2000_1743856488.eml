I've talked to John this morning and am working to finalize my agency=20
language.  FYI, my preference is to set up GPU with 3 separate passwords --=20
GPU Service Inc. as agent for Met Ed, GPU Service Inc. as agent for Penn, an=
d=20
GPU Service Inc. as agent for NJ.  Pending resolution of Enpower bridging=20
issues this afternoon, I intend to precede along this path since GPU is=20
amenable.  Do you think we should have GPU execute 3 separate ETA Amendments=
=20
in each capacity separately or do you think we should have them sign 3=20
password applications and execute one ETA Amendment relating to all three=20
capacities.

Thanks,
