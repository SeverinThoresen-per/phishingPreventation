Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest. =
 You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that o=
ff of Ventura or Harper or both.  =20

Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a b=
id for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will =
work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ve=
ntura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also=
 with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is try=
ing to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, poten=
tial dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like a=
s the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).   =20

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA =
- Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible bas=
is.

Call if you guys want to discuss.=20

regard,  BT=20
