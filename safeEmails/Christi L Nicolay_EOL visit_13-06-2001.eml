We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primaril=
y=20
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different=20
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the=20
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding=20
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk=20
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the=20
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the=20
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the=20
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to=20
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)=
