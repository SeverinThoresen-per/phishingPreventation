Stephanie, =20

Prior to the execution of the ISDA Master, LD had crossed out some stuff on =
their confirms (ex. governing law) and stuff on the Annex - and we have been=
 unable to fully execute these outstanding deals.  So... since any outstandi=
ng deals are now covered by the Master, what do we do about the ones that we=
ren't fully executed and had markups? =20

Celeste,
Can you remind me what the problems were?  If they were related to confirmin=
g trades, all trades should now be confirmed under the Master Agreement and =
all trades that were confirmed prior to the execution of the Master will als=
o now be governed by the Master.

Hey Stephanie.  Now that they have signed this ISDA for Louis Drefus Energy =
Services, LP, how does that effect the confirmations that have been sent out=
 in the past?  We are assuming this ISDA addressed the problems that were se=
nt up to legal a few months ago (Frank Sayre) and we now need to know how to=
 move forward and get our existing confirmations executed.  Can you confirm =
if it did address the issues we sent to legal and how we need to proceed to =
get these outstanding confirmations executed? =20

Thanks.

FYI, we have confirmations in 'Sent to Counterparty' status since December 1=
3, 2000.
