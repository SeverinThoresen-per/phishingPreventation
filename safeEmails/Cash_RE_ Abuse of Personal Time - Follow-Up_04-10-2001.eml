Kathy Cook talked with Ben Herman about the problem employee who was abusing=
 personal time, sick time, etc.=20

They decided that since she has used more than her  allotted sick leave, any=
 future time off will be charged as vacation or at no pay.

No need to call Kathy Cook back unless you have something additional to tell=
 her.
