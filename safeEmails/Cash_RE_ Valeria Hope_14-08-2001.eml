Michelle;
I have been working quite closely with Valeria these past few weeks on many =
difficult HR issues.  I wanted to let you know, that she is wonderful to wor=
k with.  Her calm, professional demeanor is a real asset in these times. =20

Valeria has a difficult, but critical role here at Enron.  I consider her a =
true partner to my generalist duties.

Thanks
Judy
