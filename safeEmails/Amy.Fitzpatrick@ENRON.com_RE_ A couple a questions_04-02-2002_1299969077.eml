I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS i=
s that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day=
 or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see w=
ho does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will gi=
ve you a call to fax.

I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into=
 the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case =
something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have=
 for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what=
 to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my =
new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wai=
t by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)
