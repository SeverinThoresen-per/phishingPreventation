Michelle -

Just got off the phone with Jeanie and wanted to see what we needed to do re=
garding folks who had original contracts under co code 0413 and have now tra=
nsferred to co code 1596 (this company code is called Wholesale EES).

The following people transferred to 1596 effective 10/16.

Rogers Herndon
Narsimha Misra
Berney Aucoin
Edith Cross
Oliver Jones

Timothy Coffing has been in 1596 since 8/6/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).

Gordon Savage has been in 1596 since 8/1/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).

Dale Furrow was hired into 1596 on 9/24/01.

Let me know if you thing that we need to do something for these folks - I th=
ink the concern is whether or not they can argue that their non-compete time=
 started at the point they left ENA.

Thanks!
Amy
