CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas=20
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is=20
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new=20
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the=20
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal=20
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange. =
=20
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.=
 =20
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the=20
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to=
=20
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment=20
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it=20
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES=20
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who=20
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks
