California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling

California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling

     Pasadena, California, Nov. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Power Exchange, the marketplace where the state's three investor-
owned utilities must buy electricity, is on the brink of losing
its monopoly following this summer's power-price surge.
     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week proposed
eliminating a state rule that PG&E Corp., Edison International and
Sempra Energy purchase almost all their power through the
exchange, which cost California consumers more than $100 million
to create. FERC expects to issue a final order by year-end.
     Under the proposal, the utilities could buy electricity
through other exchanges or directly from providers such as Enron
Corp. and Dynegy Inc. FERC said the move would help fix
California's ``seriously flawed'' market, where supply shortages
forced utilities to cut power to some customers this summer.
     ``The role of the power exchange is going to shrink,'' said
Josh Rokach, an adviser to FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert. ``People
will rely more on bilateral contracts'' between utilities and
generators, he said.
     Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group, went further:
``It's quite possible that the exchange will wither away if we
follow everything FERC has ordered.''

                         Expansion

     Others aren't so sure. Though intended to serve only
California, the exchange now handles one-fourth of the power
delivered in the Western Systems Coordinating Council, whose
members supply 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts
of Mexico.
     Further expansion into areas such as Nevada, Arizona and
Alberta, Canada, will offer local electricity buyers and sellers
``a well-developed market operator ready for competition,''
exchange President George Sladoje said in a statement.
     California lawmakers established the nonprofit exchange in
1996, as part of the deregulation of the state's electricity
market.
     The utilities buy 80 percent to 90 percent of their
electricity on the exchange, based in Pasadena, California. The
three utilities together supply about 75 percent of the state's
power, with the rest coming from cooperatives and municipal
agencies.

                         Long-Term Contracts

     The exchange is a day-ahead market, where buyers and sellers
set prices for power to be delivered the next day. The California
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's grid,
sells electricity in the hourly market, which fills last-minute
needs.
     FERC wants to give the utilities the opportunity to lock in
prices for power through longer-term contracts known as forwards.
Arranging supplies in advance would reduce the amount of power
that utilities must buy during periods of peak consumption, when
prices can soar, FERC says.
     Though the exchange has operated a forwards market since July
1999, the utilities until recently were prohibited from using it.
Even now, they must receive approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission to enter such contracts, and the amount of
electricity they can buy is limited.
     By comparison, municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power can freely enter into long-term
contracts and don't pay the transaction fees charged by the
exchange.
     Even if PG&E, Edison and Sempra are allowed to obtain
supplies through alternative means, the exchange isn't likely to
go away, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Sacramento-
based Independent Energy Producers, a trade group that represents
about 50 power producers.
     ``There will continue to be a need for a place for people to
do day-ahead transactions,'' Smutny-Jones said.

                         Transparency

     The exchange's ability to compete would depend in part on
whether rivals such as Enron and Dynegy, which sell electricity
throughout the U.S., are required to list prices openly, exchange
spokesman Jesus Arredondo said.
     ``Those folks don't have transparency right now,'' he said.
``If there isn't a level playing field, we're going to be at a
disadvantage.''
     Yet transparency on the exchange hasn't kept prices low.
During this year's hottest months, as demand for air conditioning
soared, the prices utilities paid for electricity through the
exchange and the California ISO more than quadrupled from a year
earlier.
     Utilities weren't able to respond to the price jump by
cutting their purchases because they needed the power, noted Bob
Levin, senior vice president of planning at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, one of the exchanges hoping to attract
business from California's utilities.
     ``FERC's proposal is a good way to start improving the
market,'' Levin said.
     Not everyone thinks allowing companies to buy outside the
exchange is without risk. State Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat
from El Cajon who co-wrote the state's 1996 deregulation law,
worries that oil and gas companies, big users of electricity for
their refineries, might draw up supply agreements in secret and
keep consumers in the dark about the terms.

                        Monopoly's End

     He warned in an Oct. 3 letter to FERC Chairman James Hoecker
that eliminating the exchange in favor of bilateral contracts
``would be disastrous, particularly for small commercial and
residential consumers.''
     Keeping California power prices a secret would be difficult,
even without the exchange, some industry observers say.
     Publishing companies such as Platt's, the commodities
division of Standard & Poor's, Financial Times Energy, and
Bloomberg LP report energy prices from around the world.
     They would be expected to begin collecting more information
in California as well if the market requires it, said Mark Palmer,
vice president of communications for Houston-based Enron Corp.,
the world's largest trader of electricity.
     ``You'll probably see California price indexes,'' Palmer
said.
     Spokesmen for Rosemead, California-based Edison and San Diego-
based Sempra said their companies wouldn't comment on future of
the exchange or their power purchases until FERC issues a final
order. PG&E, based in San Francisco, is reviewing the agency's
report, a spokesman said.
     Whatever FERC's decision, the exchange's future ultimately
should be decided by the market, not the state, said Richard
Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission.
     ``If the exchange is operating efficiently, it will survive
on its own,'' he said. ``Not as a sanctioned monopoly.''

The $6-billion wrecking ball that is waiting to slam either California=20
consumers or the utility industry is back in the control of state officials=20
after a federal commission this week failed to even address the problem.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission declared Wednesday that California=20
has defects in its deregulated electricity market and proposed sweeping=20
changes, but declined to deal with one of the most serious problems.
The summer's electricity crisis forced the state's three investor-owned=20
utilities to purchase wholesale electricity costing $6 billion more than wha=
t=20
they could charge consumers under existing rates.=20
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric now want consumers to=20
pay the full cost of those purchases in the form of monthly surcharges over=20
the next five years--a plan that would push into the distant future any hope=
=20
that deregulation would bring relief to the high-cost California electricity=
=20
market.=20
But state officials and Wall Street experts doubt the industry has any=20
realistic chance of collecting all $6 billion. Despite their confident publi=
c=20
stand, the utilities will likely settle with consumers.=20
"I'd say the chances of utilities being made whole is zero, and the chances=20
of them eating all the undercollections is zero," said Steve Fetter, an=20
analyst with debt raters Fitch of New York. Fetter is former chairman of the=
=20
Michigan Public Service Commission.=20
A high state official who asked not to be named said a majority of the Publi=
c=20
Utilities Commission believes that utilities are not entitled to the $6=20
billion under current law. "The commission has interpreted the law the same=20
way five times in a row," the official said. "So if anything is to change,=20
the legislature will have to write new law."=20
And yet division within the PUC has been evident lately, adding to the=20
confusion. Despite repeated PUC declarations that SCE and PG&E cannot raise=20
rates under the current deregulation law, the utilities were encouraged when=
=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch said on Oct. 17 that "the basic assumptions=20
underlying AB 1890 are ripe for reconsideration."=20
The electricity cost issue is a political hot potato that California=20
politicians and regulators clearly hoped the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission would handle by declaring costs "unjust and unreasonable" and by=20
ordering generators to give back profits.=20
But FERC said it found no evidence of specific market abuses and that it=20
lacked the legal authority to order refunds of federallysanctioned wholesale=
=20
rates in the absence of market-power evidence.=20
Early next year, after a new state Legislature is sworn in and Gov. Gray=20
Davis appoints his third of five members on the state Public Utilities=20
Commission, lawmakers, officials and stakeholders will have to hammer out an=
=20
agreement, which will probably require a new law. Wall Street is already=20
signaling its impatience.=20
"Our position has been that it is an unsettled situation as far as utilities=
=20
are concerned," said Richard Cortright, a director at Standard & Poor's=20
debt-rating service that downgraded its outlook on California utility debt t=
o=20

Consumer groups on the one side are clamoring for the utilities and power=20
companies to pony up for the costs of a failed experiment in a free market=20
for electrons, while on the other side the utilities who want full=20
restitution from customers for the electricity they dutifully delivered at=20
going market rates.=20
"What FERC effectively did was say to California: You guys have to choose=20
between utilities and consumers," said Douglas Heller, consumer advocate at=20
the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's up=
=20
to Gov. Davis and the Legislature to do the right thing and stand up to thes=
e=20
utility companies."=20
FERC's proposed order "really passed the buck" and left the PUC with clear=20
jurisdiction over the utilities' transition costs, said Bob Finkelstein, a=20
lawyer with The Utility Reform Network.=20
The San Francisco consumer group has proposed that the PUC require the=20
utilities to use sharply increasing profits earned through deregulation, suc=
h=20
as from the sale of power into the market, to pay off the cost of electricit=
y=20
that they have not been able to pass along to customers.=20
Utilities will argue just as strenuously that to make them absorb the=20
unexpected costs of a vital service is unfair and would impinge on needed=20
investments in electric infrastructure.=20
PG&E and SCE have each petitioned the state Public Utilities Commission for=20
permission to begin collecting those billions of dollars by approving rate=20
increases. In SCE's case, the proposed rate increase would be no more than=20
10%, which would add about $5.50 to the typical monthly residential bill.=20
Although wholesale electricity rates have risen dramatically, SCE and PG&E=20
customers are still protected by a rate freeze until utilities pay off costs=
=20
related to "stranded assets" such as nuclear, wind and other noneconomic=20
assets, or until March 2002.=20
San Diego Gas & Electric got out from under the rate freeze after paying off=
=20
its stranded assets early in 1999, and began passing along wholesale=20
electricity costs directly to customers. But the state legislature imposed a=
=20
rate cap last summer after wholesale rates doubled and tripled, causing a=20
political firestorm.=20
Steve Baum, chief executive of SDG&E parent Sempra Energy, said Thursday tha=
t=20
he was disappointed that the FERC did not open the way for refunds from the=20

"This is going to make Wall Street less than happy," Baum said. "They say=20
