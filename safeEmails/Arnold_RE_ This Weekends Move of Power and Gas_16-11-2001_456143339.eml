GAS TRADING TEAM

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people tha=
t can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Du=
e to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to en=
sure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning. =
=20

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify sys=
tem problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the m=
ove team on the floor finishing installations etc. =20

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday). =20

Thank you!
Tammy
