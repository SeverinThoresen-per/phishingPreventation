Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference=20
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at=
=20
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions=20
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference=20
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial=
=20
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. =20

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits=20
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we=20
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be=
=20
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect tha=
t=20
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small=20
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies=20
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.
