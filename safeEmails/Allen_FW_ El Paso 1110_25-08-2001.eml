Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Wa=
lsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues.=20

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1=
110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources a=
t El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected =
to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on =
the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before=
 it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant=
 the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on Septe=
mber 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to h=
ave this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you hav=
e any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 3=
9510.
