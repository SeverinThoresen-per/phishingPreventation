That is fine with me.  Are we OK with this?

Subject: New CTPY Name - Sierra Pacific Industries

I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name "Sierra Pacific Industries=
,=20
Inc." in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along=20
through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on=20
4/10.)

I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name=20
we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then =
I=20
spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off=20
of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary=
,=20
I changed the deal from it's "new counterparty" status.

Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.

Thanks,
