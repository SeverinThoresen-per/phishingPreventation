DETM is on the hunt to add more staff here in SLC!
If you know of any good Enron talent, who would be willing to relocate
here, please pass along my name to them.   We are looking for (1)
senior-level traders (physical, forward financial and options), with 3-7
years of experience, and (2) middle office risk management talent
(modeling, forecasting, hedging, portfolio analysis).   I may also have a
few upper level positions to be posted in the next few months, as well.
Bottom line is, we are looking to grow our business in the West and I'd
love to network for some talent!   Folks can contact me by:
