Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well=
=20
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedul=
e=20
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go=20
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting=
=20
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you=20
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a=20
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the=20
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in th=
e=20
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but=
=20
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were=
=20
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we=
=20
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were=
=20
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like=20
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both=20
Monday and  Wednesday.  =20

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the=20
"total body conditioning class"  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it=20
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the "total=20
body conditioning class" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it=
=20
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if=20
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you=20
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That=20
would be wonderful.   =20

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an "ab lab" clas=
s=20
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?  =20

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out=
=20
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class =20
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is=20
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set=20
up?  =20

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons. =20
