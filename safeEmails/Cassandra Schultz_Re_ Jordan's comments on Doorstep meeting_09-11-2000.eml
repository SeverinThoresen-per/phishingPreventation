Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try=
=20
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the=20
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed=20
and "gut reaction" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I=20
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from=20
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly=20
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of=20
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on=20
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=
!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to=20
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion=20
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

Ted
