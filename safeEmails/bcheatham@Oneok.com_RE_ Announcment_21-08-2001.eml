Suggested changes to the announcement:
ONEOK WesTex can only offer interruptible 311 transportation to and from the
TW interconnect. I am not suggesting this be included in the announcement
but I wanted to clarify with you the contractual arrangement ONEOK can offer
shippers on our pipeline to and from the interconnect. =20
Please include in your announcement the following contact names for ONEOK-
Butch Cheatham(918)588-7876 for gas transportation on ONEOK WesTex and
Hayley Nealis(918)588-7667 for gas storage opportunities on the ONEOK WesTex
system.      =20
