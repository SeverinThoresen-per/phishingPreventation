Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were=20
notified 1 month after the effective flow date.  Comments?

Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk. =20

Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity.

Angie/Chris

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be=20
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we=20
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening=20
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut=20
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was =
a=20
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notifie=
d=20
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August=20
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn,=20
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days =3D=
=20
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 =3D $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this=20
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this=20
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume'=
s=20
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service=20
Verification at present. =20

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been=20
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I=20
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris German=
y=20
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is=20
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about=
=20
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely=20
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue=20
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger=20
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week=20
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie
