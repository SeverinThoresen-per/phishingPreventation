I believe John Milar works for Eric Gadd.  He has spoken with a couple of my=
 guys about developing a LM2500 at one of Transwestern's compressor stations=
=2E  Despite what I told Eric a couple of months ago, they seem to be moving=
 forward.  They have received pricing from EEOS and asked Bill Williams in o=
ur Tech Services Group to check the EEOS numbers.  I will look into it furth=
er and report back.
