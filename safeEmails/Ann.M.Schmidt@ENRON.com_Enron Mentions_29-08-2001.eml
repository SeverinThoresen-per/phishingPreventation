CEO Taps Duo To Help Him Manage Enron

Two weeks after his hand-picked successor quit, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth=
 Lay tapped two veteran managers from Enron's wholesale-services unit to hel=
p him run the energy company.=20
Mark Frevert, 46 years old, was named vice chairman and Greg Whalley, 39, wa=
s named president and chief operating officer. Mr. Lay, who has extended his=
 employment contract by two years through 2005 after the surprise departure =
of Jeffrey Skilling, said he will remain chief executive for at least four m=
ore years while he works to restore the company's sagging stock price.
Mr. Frevert and Mr. Whalley were traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached=
 for comment. But Mr. Lay said he picked the pair because "they're very capa=
ble leaders with a lot of experience throughout the company."=20
Mr. Frevert is one of only a handful of people who have been at Enron, Houst=
on, since its creation in 1986. Prior to that, he worked in strategic planni=
ng at Houston Natural Gas when Mr. Lay was its chairman. Most recently, Mr. =
Frevert headed Enron's wholesale-services unit, which is the primary driver =
of its earnings and has been instrumental in a strong push into energy marke=
ting and trading activities in Europe.=20
The wholesale-services unit is responsible for commodities trading and the m=
anagement of Enron's unregulated power-generating assets.=20
In its second-quarter earnings, Enron said natural-gas volumes doubled and e=
lectricity sales grew fivefold in Europe from the second quarter of 2000. Eu=
rope now accounts for one-quarter of Enron's total trading volume. The compa=
ny doesn't currently disclose the percentage of earnings attributable to Eur=
ope, but Mr. Lay said "this may be something we'll be doing by year end," in=
 keeping with his emphasis on releasing more detailed financial information.=
=20
Mr. Whalley, who has worked at Enron since 1992, most recently was president=
 and chief operating officer of Enron's wholesale-services unit. Before that=
, he was completing graduate work at Stanford University and served as a U.S=
=2E Army officer.=20
Mr. Whalley was partly responsible for Enron's Internet-based trading platfo=
rm, Enron Online, and served as its "senior sponsor" within the corporation.=
 "Greg is a strong proponent of technology to gain a competitive advantage,"=
 said Mr. Lay.=20
Analysts believed the pair of managers were front-runners. But Mr. Lay said =
there's no guarantee either will succeed him as chief executive. "Either cou=
ld be CEO, but there are three or four others" that are in the running as we=
ll, he said. "They need to become more familiar to the financial community. =
We're in no hurry."

Two Are Promoted as Enron Seeks Executive Stability
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

08/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Aug. 28 -- With its stock still suffering after the unexpected depar=
ture of its chief executive, the Enron Corporation today promoted a top offi=
cial in its core energy-trading business to be the company's No. 2 executive=
 as it begins finding new leadership.=20
Greg Whalley, 39, was named president and chief operating officer. Also, the=
 company promoted Mark A. Frevert, 46, to vice chairman. Both will join Kenn=
eth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, in an office of the chairman.
The moves come two weeks after Jeffrey K. Skilling, a longtime protege of Mr=
=2E Lay who was the architect of Enron's wholesale energy-trading business, =
quit unexpectedly after just six months as chief executive. Mr. Lay, 59, has=
 reassumed the role of chief executive and has extended his commitment to st=
ay at the company until the end of 2005.=20
Mr. Skilling's departure, which he said was for ''purely personal'' reasons =
that he would not disclose, stunned investors, and the company's shares fell=
 14 percent in the next two days. In trading today, shares of Enron rose 40 =
cents, to $38.16, after peaking at $90 a year ago.=20
Mr. Whalley was president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Ser=
vices, the energy-trading unit that provides most of the company's operating=
 income and revenue. A former officer in the Army, Mr. Whalley joined the co=
mpany in 1992. He will ''be somewhat more kind of the operations person on a=
 day-to-day basis,'' Mr. Lay said in an interview.=20
Mr. Frevert was previously Mr. Whalley's boss as chairman and chief executiv=
e of Enron Wholesale Services. He started with a predecessor company to Enro=
n, Houston Natural Gas, in 1984, and is completing a doctorate in economics =
from Rice University.=20
The announcement today clearly makes the two men, in particular Mr. Whalley,=
 leading candidates to become chief executive, but Mr. Lay asserted that oth=
ers at Enron, whom he declined to identify, were also potential successors.=20
''Obviously, these would be two of the people on the list,'' Mr. Lay said, b=
ut he said others include ''various people depending on how they do the next=
 two to three years.'' Finding a new chief executive, however, may take as l=
ong as four or five years, he said. ''The main thing I need to convey is tha=
t I and the board are not in a big hurry on that.''=20
In the interview, Mr. Lay said no one from Enron's board ever voiced disappr=
oval of Mr. Skilling or in any way played a role in his departure, and Mr. L=
ay said that on several occasions he had asked Mr. Skilling to reconsider hi=
s decision to leave. He also said Mr. Skilling's personal reasons for leavin=
g, while not health related, were ''things with fairly short time fuses on t=
hem'' and were ''something he can't wait two or three years to address.''=20
An immediate test for both Mr. Whalley and Mr. Frevert will be winning the r=
espect and confidence of investors after the sharp slide in Enron shares thi=
s year as analysts questioned whether the company can continue to improve ea=
rnings as prices for natural gas and electricity -- its two biggest products=
 -- have declined. The stock has also been hit by fallout from a number of m=
issteps, including the troubled Dabhol power plant project in India and an e=
xpensive and unprofitable foray into trading telecommunications bandwidth.=20
Andre Meade, head of United States utilities research at Commerzbank Securit=
ies, said a chief problem was that energy trading and marketing account for =
a far bigger part of Enron's market capitalization than they do at other unr=
egulated energy companies, but Enron's financial disclosures largely do not =
break down this business to show the profitability of different products and=
 different regions.=20
''All that is compressed into one set of numbers, and it's really hard for a=
nalysts to determine where they are making money in a given quarter and wher=
e they are losing money,'' Mr. Meade said.=20
He added that Enron's having so much of its market capitalization tied up in=
 a business that is so difficult for investors to understand ''is really dis=
concerting.''=20
Neither Mr. Whalley nor Mr. Frevert were available for comment, an Enron spo=
kesman said. In the interview today, Mr. Lay, reiterating comments made to T=
he Wall Street Journal, said he would try to make Enron's financials and bus=
iness model more easily understood to investors.=20
''Analysts have expressed some concerns about that, and we're addressing tho=
se concerns,'' he said, though he added that ''they'll probably never get al=
l the information they want.'' Enron will break out more information on busi=
ness segments and geographic results, he said, but he also said the company =
would probably not provide profit and loss numbers for natural gas and elect=
ricity -- by far the biggest products it trades.=20
He also confirmed that Enron has ''unwound'' a series of complex deals it ha=
d entered into with partnerships that included Enron's chief financial offic=
er, Andrew Fastow. The transactions had been done for hedging and tax reason=
s, he said.=20
Enron's financial statements include other complex transactions. For example=
, the most recent 10-K states that Enron might be required to issue new shar=
es of common stock if the price falls below levels ranging from $28.20 to $5=
5 because of ''certain financial contracts.'' Enron's stock has been below $=
55 for the last three months, but the company has not had to issue shares, a=
 spokesman said. Enron may end up not having to issue any shares, he said, a=
nd any that are issued are already accounted for in diluted earnings per sha=
re.

Kenneth Lay, head of US energy giant Enron, took the first step toward repla=
cing Jeffrey Skilling as chief executive with the appointments yesterday of =
two senior executives to the chairman's office.=20
Mr Lay chose Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer of Enron Wh=
olesale Services, and Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive of Enron Wh=
olesale Services, from his shortlist of five candidates.
He has said the men chosen would be in the running for chief executive once =
he steps down, although he would continue to consider other executives who s=
how potential.=20
In line with their appointments, Mr Whalley has been promoted to president a=
nd chief operating officer of Enron, while Mr Frevert has been promoted to v=
ice-chairman of the company.=20
"In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective =
26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played k=
ey roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in Nor=
th America and Europe," Mr Lay said.=20
Mr Whalley, 39, holds a bachelor's degree from the United States Military Ac=
ademy and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.=20
His fellow appointee, Mr Frevert, 46, has a bachelor's degree in economics f=
rom Albion College in Michigan. He has completed all the requirements except=
 the final dissertation for a PhD in economics from Rice University.=20
Mr Lay plans to take his time to ensure he has the right person for the job =
and told the Financial Times last week that he has agreed to stay on as chie=
f executive until at least the end of 2005, and would stay even longer if ne=
eded.=20
His predecessor, Mr Skilling, left after just six months in the job, citing =
personal reasons. His exit, following the departures of several other execut=
ives, has left analysts wondering about the remaining depth of talent at the=
 company.=20
Mr Lay said Enron's senior management committee of 25 executives has an aver=
age age of 41 and an average tenure of 11 years.=20
"You've got some that have 15 to 20 years service, and you've got others tha=
t have six or seven, but I think they are a very experienced team and very c=
apable of continuing to lead this company."=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, on Tuesday promoted Greg =
Whalley and Mark Frevert to the office of the chairman, making them the top =
candidates for the chief executive's job Jeffrey Skilling left two weeks ago=
=2E=20
Whalley, 39, was named president and chief operating officer. He had held th=
ose titles at Enron Wholesale Services, the energy- and commodity-trading un=
it that brings in most of Enron's revenue. Frevert, 46, was chairman and chi=
ef executive of Wholesale Services. He was named vice chairman.
Chairman Kenneth Lay said the two executives will help run the company while=
 he selects Skilling's successor.=20
Investors pushed Enron's shares down more than 14% in the two days after Ski=
lling quit.=20
Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments.=20
"They'll be looking at all of the businesses--the wholesale unit, government=
 affairs. Anything that affects Enron," Lay said.=20
Shares of Enron rose 40 cents to close at $38.16 on the New York Stock Excha=
nge. They have plunged 56% in the last year as Enron's plan to trade space o=
n telecommunications networks collapsed along with the fortunes of Internet =
companies, and investors questioned whether Enron can continue to post huge =
gains in energy-trading sales and profit.=20
Skilling helped Lay transform Enron from a natural-gas pipeline company into=
 the top competitor in energy trading. Before Tuesday, they were the only ex=
ecutives in the office of the chairman.=20
Skilling became chief executive in February as Lay, 59, held on to the chair=
man's title. Skilling said Aug. 14 he quit for personal and family reasons, =
though he later said worry caused by the recent stock price decline contribu=
ted to his decision. Lay, who has taken over as chief executive, has had his=
 employment contract extended to 2005.=20
Lay has been meeting investors and analysts to calm fears the firm may be hi=
ding bad financial news, and that he will have a difficult time finding a ne=
w chief executive.

Two Top Executives Named to Join Enron's Office of Chairman

Reporter (TM)

Enron Corp. named the two men in charge of its wholesale business Tuesday to=
 join Ken Lay in the office of the chairman.=20
Both are considered candidates to take over the chief executive officer's ro=
le, which Lay, Enron's chairman, reclaimed two weeks ago when Jeff Skilling =
unexpectedly resigned.
Greg Whalley, 39, president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale S=
ervices, was named president and chief operating officer of the company.=20
Mark Frevert, 46, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices, was named vice chairman of Enron.=20
The wholesale business, which includes marketing and trading of energy and o=
ther commodities such as metals, is Enron's core operation and main profit d=
river.=20
For the first six months of 2001, wholesale services brought in nearly $97 b=
illion in revenues. Enron itself reported $100.2 billion in revenues for the=
 first half of the year.=20
Both Whalley and Frevert played key roles in boosting the company's deliveri=
es of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe, Lay said.=20
"They share a number of things in common," Lay said. "They are good leaders.=
"=20
The two will work with Lay in the chairman's office to run the company and s=
et its strategy.=20
Both were traveling on business for Enron Tuesday and not available for comm=
ent.=20
Tuesday's announcement was set in motion when Skilling surprised Wall Street=
 by saying he was stepping down for personal and family reasons after only s=
ix months in the chief executive's job.=20
Lay stressed it's not automatic that Whalley or Frevert would eventually tak=
e over as chief executive. A few other Enron executives are potential CEO ca=
ndidates.=20
"These are the two best-qualified candidates right now to work with me in ru=
nning Enron," Lay said. "Time will tell whether these two or one of a few ot=
her people will become the CEO to replace me someday."=20
It could take two to four years before a replacement is ready, and Lay pledg=
ed to remain at the helm until then.=20
At the end of regular trading, shares in Enron closed up 40 cents at $38.16.=
=20
Andre Meade, an analyst who follows Enron at at Commerzbank Securities, who =
follows Enron, said the announcement contained no surprises, "which is a goo=
d thing."=20
"They are two senior managers that had significant roles in the real growth =
businesses at Enron, which are the wholesale businesses both in the U.S. and=
 Europe," Meade said.=20
Whalley, who joined Enron in 1992, has a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Mil=
itary Academy in West Point, N.Y., and an MBA from Stanford University's Gra=
duate School of Business.=20
His past Enron jobs include heading the European commodity merchant business=
, chief executive of global risk management and chief executive of Enron Nor=
th America.=20
Frevert, who joined Enron predecessor Houston Natural Gas in 1984, has a bac=
helor's degree in economics from Albion College in Michigan. He must finish =
his final dissertation to get a Ph.D. in economics from Rice University.=20
Frevert was in charge of both North American natural gas marketing activitie=
s and international energy service operations. He also was chief executive o=
f Enron Europe.=20
Lay doesn't plan to name replacements for Whalley and Frevert to head up the=
 wholesale operation. Instead, to streamline, the individual wholesale busin=
ess segments will report to the office of the chairman.=20
Other organizational fine-tuning is expected.=20
Enron's stock traded as high as $82 at the end of January and was later batt=
ered for a number of reasons, including the collapse of the company's broadb=
and business, fallout from California's energy crisis and continuing dispute=
s surrounding a power plant project in India.=20
Investors and analysts also have been asking Enron to release more detailed =
financial information -- something Lay recently said he would do.=20
"The core thing that Ken Lay needs to do is restore some confidence in the s=
tory," Meade said, including following through with data disclosure.

MUMBAI: Domestic FIs are planning to have an out-of-court settlement between=
 Enron and MSEB on various issues as part of their exercise to complete the =
second phase of the project.=20
The FIs have initiated this exercise due to the apprehension of funds availa=
bility in the current escrow account, especially since the loan repayment to=
 the institutions is due in September and the pre-termination notice from En=
ron is applicable from November.
The interest payments for the loans will dry up by September and Enron will =
not be able to service either the interest or the principal since the first =
phase has been shut down due to differences over the PPA between MSEB and th=
e US utility major.=20
"Currently we are not looking at any buyer for the project, but finding ways=
 to complete and run it," a senior FI official familiar with the negotiation=
s said. "An early solution for Enron is to find a buyer who is acceptable to=
 us, since they wanted to quit India," he added.=20
Enron has valued the equity of the project at $ 1.1 billion.=20
A senior level committee with representatives from IDBI, ICICI Ltd, SBI and =
IFCI has been set up to ink an action plans to resolve the imbroglio.

Pooling Point Oper Names New CEO, Part Of Strategy Change
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

08/28/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A company founded on the promise of bandwidth trading =
two years ago named a new chief executive Tuesday as part of its ongoing cha=
nge in strategy.=20
LighTrade Inc. named Kathleen Perone, the company's chairman of the board, a=
s chief executive. She replaces Ted Pierson, who founded the company to prov=
ide neutral pooling points for the nascent bandwidth trading market.
The change is part of the company's ongoing switch from serving the moribund=
 bandwidth trading market to doing longer-term contracts for connections bet=
ween telecommunications carrier networks.=20
"Whether or not any sort of trading market develops, the carriers can utiliz=
e us now," Perone told Dow Jones Newswires. "The downturn in capital markets=
 has created significant problems for the telecoms."=20
Among those problems are the inability to fund interconnections between netw=
orks. Perone also suggested that, with consolidation among carriers expected=
 in the next year or so, they may consider using LighTrade's pooling points =
to interconnect newly acquired networks quickly.=20
Pooling points are network interconnections where ownership of bandwidth is =
transferred from one company to another. They are also used to monitor quali=
ty of service.=20
Perone, 48 years old, has 23 years of experience in telecommunications. She =
is a managing director of Acappella Ventures LLC., a venture capital firm an=
d one of the original investors in LighTrade. She will continue in that job =
as well.=20
Pierson and Perone said the change was made as the company switches from the=
 startup phase to the operational phase.=20
"It's a natural evolution," Pierson, now vice chairman of the board, told Do=
w Jones Newswires. "I'm a starter and an entrepreneur. I'm not an operationa=
l CEO."=20
Pierson described Perone as well-known in the telecommunications industry an=
d "a superior marketer and salesperson."=20
Perone said LighTrade will also call upon her knowledge of venture capital m=
arkets. The private company is projected to be cash-flow positive in 18 mont=
hs, but it doesn't have financing on hand to reach early 2003, she said.=20
"We are funded for the time being," Perone said. "We can go long enough."=20
LighTrade is the only company offering neutral pooling points. Enron Corp. (=
ENE), Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) all hav=
e bandwidth pooling points in the networks operated by their telecommunicati=
ons units.=20
Those pooling points, however, may be unappealing to potential customers. To=
 deliver bandwidth, the pooling point operator must know who the customer is=
, raising fears that it could use that knowledge to steal the customer.=20
LighTrade, with eight pooling points compared with Enron's 22, offers a non-=
competing alternative to the energy companies in the bandwidth market. LighT=
rade doesn't trade bandwidth.=20
But the company faces increased competition from network exchange centers, a=
n industry analyst said.=20
Companies like Universal Access, a subsidiary of UAXS Global Holdings Inc. (=
UAXS), operate exchange centers where a number of network providers can inte=
rconnect, creating "virtual pooling points," Yankee Group Analyst Seth Libbe=
y told Dow Jones Newswires. "They're fulfilling the promise of the virtual p=
ooling point," he said.=20
A virtual pooling point is a series of networks connected to each other for =
traditional telecom business, not for bandwidth trading purposes. Some carri=
ers say that virtual pooling points could be used for bandwidth trading.=20
Physical pooling points like the ones LighTrade operates are only attractive=
 if they are neutral and connected to large numbers of longhaul and metropol=
itan network carriers.=20
"LighTrade's a victim of what's going on in the bandwidth market," he said. =
"There's a lot of action in trading, but not a lot of capacity being transfe=
rred."=20
LighTrade plans to increase the number of pooling points it operates to 15 b=
y first quarter 2002.=20

HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. may have scaled down its broadband t=
elecommunications plans, but it will continue to pursue opportunities beyond=
 its traditional core wholesale natural gas and electricity markets.=20
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in an interview Tuesday th=
at recent ventures into the wholesale marketing and trading of paper, coal a=
nd steel looked "very promising.".
"We'll continue to do those," he told Reuters. "Those are becoming very sign=
ificant businesses. Particularly this year we've had really strong growth in=
 pulp and paper, in coal and in weather derivatives and some of the other ne=
w activities."=20
Enron expects to get its broadband business on a sound footing, even though =
the potential market for buying and selling broadband capacity, also know as=
 bandwidth, now appears to be much more modest than Enron and others had pre=
viously assumed.=20
"We still think we'll develop a very nice business there over the next two o=
r three years," Lay said.=20
Enron also continues to see good opportunities for its energy services busin=
ess, which takes care of energy purchasing and management for customers such=
 as retailer J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and drug firm Eli Lilly & Co.=20
Lay was speaking after Enron said two long-time employees, Greg Whalley and =
Mark Frevert, will join Lay in the office of the chairman, strengthening the=
 senior management team after the surprise resignation of Jeff Skilling as C=
EO on Aug. 14.=20
PLEDGE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION=20
Lay said Enron will do a better job of explaining its finances and operation=
s to investors and analysts in the future, starting as soon as the company's=
 third-quarter earnings report.=20
"I've heard that criticism, I'm listening to it and yes we will address it. =
We will start providing more detailed information," he said.=20
Shortcomings in this area are one of several factors cited for a sharp drop =
in Enron's share price from levels of just over $90 a year ago to recent lev=
els in the mid-$30s.=20
Lay said Enron will continue to sell off physical assets around the world su=
ch as pipelines and power plants and focus on the knowledge-based marketing,=
 trading and risk-management activities that it regards as its true strength=
=2E=20
"We will certainly continue to emphasize monetizing some of the internationa=
l assets, particularly in developing countries, and bring that cash or capit=
al back into the company, either to redeploy it in these faster growing and =
higher return businesses, or to buy in shares or pay down debt," he said.=20
Enron recently sought to disengage from India, offering to sell its majority=
 stake in the Dabhol power plant project project for $1 billion to extricate=
 itself from a long and bitter dispute over payments for the power generated=
 by the plant.=20
Lay said recent comments he made about the Dabhol project in an interview wi=
th the Financial Times were "mischaracterized" as a call by Enron for retali=
atory U.S. sanctions against India.=20
"We've not asked for sanctions and it really got blown out of proportion," h=
e said.=20
Lay declined to comment on an idea floated by Indian lenders to buy out Enro=
n's stake in the Dabhol project if the cost of the electricity produced by t=
he plant can be lowered, saying only that Enron was continuing to talk to al=
l parties involved.=20
"It's still problematical as to where that may be headed," he said of the Da=
bhol project.
