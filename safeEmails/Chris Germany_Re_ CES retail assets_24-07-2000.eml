Yo buddy!!  I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES=20
officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also=20
told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total=
=20
by Pipeline.  Get back with you soon.

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline=20
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the=20
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it=20
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
 =20
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for=20
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike
