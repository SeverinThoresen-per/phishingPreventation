Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not=
 being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply V=
erifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals sho=
uld be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these dea=
ls.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have=
 a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & =
A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have req=
uested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the =
system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are =
setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables is=
sues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as inte=
rest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you =
what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the =
better.

Thanks,
Marlo=20

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the f=
irst I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is.=
 Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer w=
ould be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be p=
ossible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, =
we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balance=
s left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional in=
formation that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of res=
olving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soo=
n as possible.


Thanks
Darla Saucier
