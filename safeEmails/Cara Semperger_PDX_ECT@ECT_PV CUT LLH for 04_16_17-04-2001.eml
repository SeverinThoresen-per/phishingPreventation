We had a very strange cut today starting HE 1-6. Tag # 016370L where the gen=
 is EPE- E-CISO-PACE   happened to be a cancelled tag and none of the counte=
rparties including us did not know anything. After spending hours on the pho=
ne with CISO and PAC John @ PACE found that this tag had been replaced by ta=
g 16381N   but none knew anything about it. This tag was for 78 MW and it wa=
s done by a PACE prescheduler.  We were trying to find a new sink in the mea=
ntime so before this new tag was found the following went RT

HE 01 78 MW to APS  (APS took the power)
HE 02 sank with LADWP @ $0. I agreed with John at PACE that we are going to =
charge PAC for HE 1-2 LDs
Then for HE 3-6  the power was sent to PACE for the original deal price at P=
V.

John at PACE was going to leave good notes to his prescheduler about this cu=
t. I did not do anything HA to manage the cut (in enpower, Lotus notes ) as =
JOhn at PACE did not consider this a HA cut but a DA cut that nobody knew ab=
out. We left it up to the preschedulers to agree on this cut.

if you have questions ask me,
Monika
