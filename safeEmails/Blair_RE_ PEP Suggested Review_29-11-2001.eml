Lynn,

This does cause me a good deal of concern.  Kathy does not know that much of=
 what I do and we do not share customers as Harry & I have done.  She is als=
o new again to scheduling, so all those facets of my performance would be mi=
ssing.  I might add that at midyear Harry was also unavailable for my review=
, and yet because of our close proximity, he knows better than anyone on the=
 team how I spend my days.  At the end of the day, none of this may matter, =
but it is a concern today.

Thank you for your consideration.

Janet
