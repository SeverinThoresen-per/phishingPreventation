We all realize these are difficult times and we must all adjust and work tog=
ether but I would like to make you aware of the recent support changes that =
pose some issues for Logistics.  We are told that the Solution Center is not=
 available after 7:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday nor are they available on =
the weekend.  We are continuing to schedule gas in Logistics albeit on a lim=
ited basis during these after hours so is there anyway IT can manage to prov=
ide some level of support?

We appreciate your efforts to work with us to develop a solution. =20
