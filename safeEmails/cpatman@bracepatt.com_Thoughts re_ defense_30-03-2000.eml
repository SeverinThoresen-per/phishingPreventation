CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/ATTORNEY AND ATTORNEY/CLIENT=20
COMMUNICATION

My review of files on Dow Waiver has made me recall some important facts in=20
support of the program's legality.

First, the 1978 Dow Waiver Program (which involved only wells in the Evetts=20
Field) was instituted, at least in part, because interstate pipelines' takes=
=20
from split-stream wells in that field were resulting in imbalances.  The=20
intrastate producers were concerned that their fair share of the production=20
was being siphoned off by the interstates.  Takes to redress that type of=20
situation fall exactly within the meaning of "just and reasonable"=20
discrimination, according to Don Ray (and that makes sense).

Second, the 1984 Dow Waiver Program, which began in August 1984, resulted in=
=20
virtually no discrimination at all, since all other producers were offered=20
the opportunity to participate in Panhandle in March, 1985.  The price=20
offered by Panhandle was the lesser of (i) 90% of Panhandle's resale price o=
n=20
the spot market, or (ii) the producer's base contract price.  Most producers=
=20
accepted the Panhandle offer.  Dow Waiver and Panhandle producers' gas was=20
taken at rates of 100% of what the wells could produce.  Thus, at least as o=
f=20
March 1985, everyone had the opportunity for the same deal -- 100% of volume=
s=20
taken at the lesser of the base K price or the 90%-of-resale price..  The Do=
w=20
Waiver volumes were already being taken at the base contract price, which=20
generally was lower than the Panhandle price; Panhandle producers' gas was=20
being taken at the lesser of base K price or Panhandle price.  So even=20
leaving aside the issue of the Panhandle volumes having been released from=20
the base Ks, there was no discrimination.  The RRC was aware of the terms of=
=20
the Panhandle "lesser of" price offer and raised no objection.  Nor did any=20
producer complain to the RRC that a "lesser of" offer was illegal.  Thus, th=
e=20
Dow Waiver Program cannot have resulted in illegal discrimination as to=20
producers who entered the Panhandle Program as of March 1985.
