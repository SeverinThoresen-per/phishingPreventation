SOCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  VEPCO and CP&L have proteste=
d=20
SOCO's filing stating that they perform interconnection studies differently=20
than SOCO in this aspect:

VEPCO and CP&L state that they perform studies by modeling the transmission=20
system with the loads in the base case unchanged and the output of existing=20
and higher queued planned generators that serve load ratched down to allow=20
the grid to accept the full output of the new generator "at the point of=20
receipt."

SOCO performs the studies using the "extension cord" method -- models the=20
transmission system with load ratched up in an amount equal to the output of=
=20
the new generator.

While a generator customer is still not assured that it will get=20
"transmission" until it makes a separate OASIS request, VEPCO and CP&L state=
=20
that their method provides some "assurance" (ie, no guarantee) that the=20
customer would not be denied transmission later due to no ATC at the point o=
f=20
receipt (generator).  I think that their method might also possibly result i=
n=20
higher "network" upgrades to be charged to generator.

EPMI has not protested SOCO's interconnection filing for other reasons. =20
However, this may be something of concern to us in these regions and others.=
 =20
Let me know any concerns.  I think FERC will address this issue when it=20
issues an order on SOCO's filing (which could be this month or several=20
months--most likely before summer).  Thanks.
