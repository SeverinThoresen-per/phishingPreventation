I give all void requests to Claudette Danials.  She enters all voids and sto=
p=20
payments for the AP department now.  We cannot void MSA checks in SAP.  What=
=20
we do is a journal entry to reverse the original expense (converted to SAP=20
coding) and outstanding checks.  Lupe and the Wire Team do enter their own=20
voids when it is a wire, but since this one was a check, Claudette should=20
have it.  I do remember seeing the Goldman Sachs void request and I discusse=
d=20
it with Lien Nguyen on our wire team before she gave it to Claudette.

Ben,

As per a voicemail I left you today, one of the Enron Global Markets Teams=20
(Global Risk Markets) is awaiting the reversal of a check (to Goldman Sachs)=
=20
that was wired out instead.  Kortney Brown and Dana Davis had worked with yo=
u=20
and Lupy Spencer on this before.  Last anyone heard, it had made it to your=20
desk.

I was checking to see if that was the case and if there would be any=20
difficulty in voiding a legacy MSA check on the new SAP system.  Please let=20
me know what you find or if you need any further information.


Stephen=20
