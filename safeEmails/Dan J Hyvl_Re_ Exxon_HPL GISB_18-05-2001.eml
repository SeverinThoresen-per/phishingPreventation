Cheryl,
 I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the=20
deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I kne=
w=20
that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period pos=
t=20
of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or=20
Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with th=
e=20
confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting=
=20
you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group=
=20
has already indicated that they did not have it.

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg=20
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal coverin=
g=20
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed=20
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958=20
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a=20
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of=20
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB=
=20
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the onl=
y=20
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print th=
e=20
confirm out of Tagg.=20

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no=20
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing=20
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that. =20
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note: =20
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have=
=20
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could=20
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard=20
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able=
=20
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split)=20
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
SBR
