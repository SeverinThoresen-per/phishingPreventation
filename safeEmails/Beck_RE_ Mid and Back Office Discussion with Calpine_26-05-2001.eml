The afternoon of the 5th works good for us.  We'll be in San Jose on the
4th.  How does 4:00 work for you?  Let me know.

   Paul,

   Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work
   and responsibility these days.

   Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great
   application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever
   increasing transaction flow.

   In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would
   like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team
   what we mean by "outsourcing" your mid and back office functions to our
   "ProsessCo/ServiceCo."  I think we have identified what types of
   services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically,
   you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation,
   nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and
   cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it
   hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to
   accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from
   scratch.

   I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on
   security/neutrality, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the
   ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all
   that as well.

   I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

   Let me know your thoughts.

   Piper
