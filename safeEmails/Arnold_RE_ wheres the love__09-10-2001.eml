For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, =
and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with c=
ash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the =
fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come =
off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at set=
tlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer will be a=

ldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some room to go up, b=

d before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend.  Seems li=
ke the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry.  All the winter m=
onths might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing to be short is jan. =20
