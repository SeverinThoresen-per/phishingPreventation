Kristian,

	I finally grew some balls and had my meeting with Murray. It went really we=
ll, a lot different than I expected. I now have to meet w/ Tim so that he ca=
n lay out what opportunities he thinks exist on the floor. That should be in=
teresting. I will get in early tomorrow, and give you a call to give you an =
update. I have not sent my accomplishments b/c I wanted to hear what Tim had=
 to say as far as opportunities on the floor. The last thing I want to do is=
 have Paul take the time to go pass around my resume and me not follow throu=
gh on those potential offers. Talk to you tommorow.

								Chris
