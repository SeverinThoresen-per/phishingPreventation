John:
I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the=
=20
ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you=20
were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the=20
Schedules:

1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure=
=20
I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of=20
the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part o=
f=20
the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?

2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.

3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement whic=
h=20
makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of=20
Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?

4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusua=
l=20
ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services=20
that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this=20
additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I=
=20
don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigge=
r=20
for that to go to zero is something else.

5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a=20
Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.

6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I thin=
k=20
is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.

7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.

Please call me when convenient to discuss further.
