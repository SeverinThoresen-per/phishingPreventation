I just got off the phone with Kjell and he said the problem was in a coil in=
 the superheater.  They are in the process of blinding off the coil and esti=
mate being back to full speed within 7 hours of right now (right now being 1=
:30 pm our time).

With this in mind, their new ETA to the Lake Charles buoy is 10:00 on the 9t=
h.  That would put them at the dock approximately 16:00 on the 9th.  I would=
 guess that the ship tour could not begin until approximately 6:00 to 8:00 p=
m on the 9th given this schedule.  This schedule is still tentative and I wi=
ll pass on more updates as I get them.

Doug/David- please pass this on to whoever is coordinating the trip for the =
people from the Bahamas.

Dan
