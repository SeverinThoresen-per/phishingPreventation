FYI. update on movie trading business.=20
I change my mind. At first I though that we should focus on customers who=20
want to diversify their unique risks. But now I feel that, at this moment,=20
the "make-sense" people are not easy to find in reality. (Even myself who ow=
n=20
Enron stock, not Dynergy.) There are more risk takers than risk diversified=20
people. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business=

Thanks, Key, for the volume information. Because HSX is a fake market, I=20
think this indicates that there are lots of speculators out there in the=20
movie trading business. So I believe "speculators" might be one of our major=
=20
customers. (Like stock markets, a (big?) part of brokers' profits are from=20
speculators' commissions.)

I know the "diversification" is a good thing to do but may be hard to do in=20
reality. Even for myself, who is working for Enron and owning Enron shares, =
I=20
would not buy Dynergy stocks even if it makes sense to do that for reducing=20
my unique risk...  In stead, I buy Enron shares, so I am a speculator (risk=20
taker) myself...=20

Regarding moral-hazzard/information-asymmetry issue in the movie business,=20
the market price will reflect this risk. In addition, I think we can 1) try=20
not taking any position or 2) have a diversified portfolio of movies.=20

If we operate as a broker and maintain balanced books, one question is how=20
much we have to invest to create these markets... Thin margin can help=20
generate volume.

Key - Interesting information.  Personally, I am blown away by the large=20
membership HSX claims.   Even if they have a decent percentage of these=20
numbers, that would suggest that movies and the related industry is becoming=

sport as well as entertainment.  I guess the fact that you can already find=20
