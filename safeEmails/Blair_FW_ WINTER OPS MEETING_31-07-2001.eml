Please have your presentations for the NNG Winter Ops meeting sent to Debbie=
 Moore, who is in Gina Taylor's shop, by August 20th. Debbie will then put a=
ll the presentations in the same format. We want to be able to make copies h=
ere in Houston and ship to Kansas City rather than pay Kinko's up there to m=
ake copies which is very expensive. Your co-operation is appreciated. thanks=
