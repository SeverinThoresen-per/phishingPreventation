We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly an=
d ready to trade when the system goes live.=20

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct data=
base. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop=
 and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons).=20
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the=
 subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa =
Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to hel=
p you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond
