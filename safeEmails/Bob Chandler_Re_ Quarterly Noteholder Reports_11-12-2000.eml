Thanks for your comments below.=20

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal=
=20
for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in=20
the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there=20
are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a=20
stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end,=20
it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter. =20
In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions=
=20
in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and=
=20
we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad=20
about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I=20
otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders=20
disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the=20
noteholders reports were distributed. =20

As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on=20
Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.=20

Subject: Quarterly Noteholder Reports

I've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders.  I=20
haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have=
=20
three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of "Price Risk Management=20
Activities" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial=20
impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional=20
amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the "fair value" of the=20
trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of=20
the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember=20
right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence. =20
Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing=20
something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller=20
number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the=
=20
Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW=20
and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals=20
separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like=20
notional value and "fair value" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accuratel=
y=20
reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN=
=20
were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerne=
d=20
about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the=20
limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur=20
Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a=20
real problem. =20

Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues.  DF
