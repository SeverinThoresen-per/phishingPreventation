Carol,

I am about to be on nanny #9 since July, 1999 - I haven't had great luck and=
=20
always have a live-in.  I am presently going through Au Pair in America and =
I=20
would be happy to have them send you info - but they do live in and there is=
=20
a pretty substantial agency fee.  My assistant, Erica Braden, also found an=20
interesting website www.nanniesplus.com which seems to have a whole range of=
=20
different types of nannies who work in different circumstances (i.e. live-in=
,=20
live-out, housework, no housework, etc.) - this also involves an agency and =
a=20
smaller (but not insignificant) fee than au pair in America.  From time to=20
time Ali's school will have a posting for a nanny - I'll forward it to you i=
f=20
I see such a listing.  Good luck - may you fare better than I have!

Cynthia

=09


I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4=
=20
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can=20
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We=20
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone=
=20
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you=20
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I=
=20
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me=20
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think=20
might be able to help.  Thanks.
