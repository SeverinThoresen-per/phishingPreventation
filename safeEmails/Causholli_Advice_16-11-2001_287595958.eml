Hello Jim,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon. Tha=
t's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I woul=
d like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security. My j=
ob prospects don't look good either now that Enron was bought from another c=
ompany.  I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assi=
stantships. I am looking into all of those.=20

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ =
direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own=
 researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school. I =
have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I r=
eally don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious an=
d work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worke=
d for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I really=
 would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else=
 to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any contact in the j=
ob market I would look into that too.=20

Thanks Jim,
Monika
