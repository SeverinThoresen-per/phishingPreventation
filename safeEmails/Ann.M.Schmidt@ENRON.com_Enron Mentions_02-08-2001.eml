Fort Peck Indians File $3 Million Suit Against Northern Border Pipeline

Outcome Could Have National Implications=20
POPLAR, Mont., Aug. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- In a move that could have significant =
national implications, the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribal Nation has=
 filed suit in the Fort Peck Tribal Court against Northern Border Pipeline C=
ompany, a unit of Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NYSE: NBP), to collect mor=
e than $3 million in back taxes.
Northern Border, a partnership of Enron (NYSE: ENE), Williams Energy Partner=
s (NYSE: WEG) and TransCanada Pipelines (NYSE: TRP), owns and operates a nat=
ural gas pipeline and compression station on the 2.3 million-acre Ft. Peck R=
eservation in northeast Montana. The 1,214-mile large diameter natural gas l=
ine, which has 15 compressor, stations stretches from the vast Western Canad=
ian Sedimentary Basin near Monchy, Saskatchewan to Manhattan, Ill. It has a =
delivery capacity of 2.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). Northern Border=
's gross investment in 1999 was listed at $2.4 billion.=20
Tribal Chairman Arlyn Headdress said Northern Border officials "negotiated w=
ith us for two years" before the Tribes gave permission to begin constructio=
n to cross their land in 1980.=20
"From the pipeline completion until recently, Northern Border honored all of=
 its obligations. In fact, the lease has been fully paid, but the company ha=
s refused to honor its tax obligations for the past two years," Headdress sa=
id. "We have tried repeatedly to negotiate a resolution of all issues, but h=
ave failed."=20
Headdress said he is "baffled" by the pipeline company's refusal to work out=
 a settlement of the tribal taxes.=20
"We have had a great relationship since 1980. In fact, Northern Border contr=
acted us to help build the pipeline and compressor stations that are on and =
just off of the reservation. Yet now, they refuse to deal reasonably. Northe=
rn Border's lease to use our tribal homelands expires in 2011, and its payme=
nt of tribal taxes is the major value the Tribes receive from the Company. I=
f these taxes are not paid, the Tribes would have little reason to renew the=
 lease when it expires."=20
Headdress said the tax that Northern Border is refusing to pay represents ap=
proximately 25 percent of the Tribes' total annual revenue. The value of the=
 tax until the lease ends is approximately $13.8 million.=20
The Northern Border suit is the second court action taken by the Tribes to c=
ollect back taxes. Currently before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is a su=
it against Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. (NYSE: BNI) which operates 80 =
miles of railway on the reservation. The suit seeks to collect approximately=
 $1.2 million in taxes a year.=20
Tribal attorney Reid Peyton Chambers of the Washington, D.C. law firm Sonosk=
y, Chambers, Sachse, Endreson & Perry, said the outcome of these suits could=
 establish a precedent for commercial operations on reservations across the =
country.=20
"For the past 30 years, Congress and the executive branch have encouraged tr=
ibes to govern their own reservations and become economically self- sufficie=
nt," Chambers said. "An important part of that process involves the right of=
 the tribes to assess reasonable taxes on non-Indian businesses operating wi=
thin the boundaries of their reservations. Yet, today we are seeing court ru=
lings that some companies interpret as setting aside these rights. Clearly, =
much more decisive and definitive action is needed if the tribes are to meet=
 the goal of self-sufficiency desired by Congress and the President."=20
Under current law, tribes are allowed to collect taxes on non-Indian busines=
ses if any of four conditions exist.=20
"If there is a consensual relationship with contracts and agreements over ti=
me, if a company's activities threaten public safety and welfare, if the ent=
erprise's activity is on trust land, or if Congress has authorized the tax, =
the tribes are legally entitled to assess and collect taxes," Chambers said.=
 "For both Northern Border and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, these condition=
s exist."=20
Headdress said the suit was filed in Tribal Court because the courts have he=
ld that issues concerning Native Americans that occur on tribal land should =
first be heard in Tribal Court.=20
The Ft. Peck Assiniboine Sioux Tribal Nation consists of two related Indian =
tribes that have existed before Columbus came to America. The tribes settled=
 on the Ft. Peck Reservation in the early 1870's and today have approximatel=
y 11,000 members. The reservation has a two-year college, health care center=
 and industrial park along with cattle and buffalo ranching operations. Only=
 a small part of their revenues come from gaming operations because of their=
 isolated location. CONTACT: Peggy Striegel=20

USA: Scramble for Caribs tankers forces rates skywards.

08/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The cost of transporting crude from Mexico and Ven=
ezuela to the U.S. is spiralling rapidly skywards as cargo owners scramble t=
o lock in tankers from a fast-dwindling fleet, brokers said on Wednesday.=20
"You won't find a ship available now until August 12, so the ship owners are=
 getting very bullish on rates," said one U.S. broker. He pegged the upcoast=
 trade on Aframaxes (70,000 tonners) at W165 ($1.17 per barrel), but other b=
rokers said W170-180 was likely today.
This represents a rise of at least 29 cents per barrel in the course of a we=
ek.=20
"People are fixing further and further out, say two to three weeks, just to =
secure tonnage," said a broker.=20
"If you're in the chartering department of an oil major it's embarrassing to=
 pay too much, but its even more embarrassing to be caught without a ship fo=
r your cargo," he added.=20
The market has gained as much as 10 points a day since last Wednesday when i=
t stood at W125 ($0.88 per barrel), brokers said.=20
Oslo brokers reported on Wednesday morning that Enron had paid W165 for the =
70,000 tonner Nordgulf, loading in the Caribbean in the first week of August=
=2E Valero paid W167 for the Aegean Pride, loading August 13 in Mexico.=20
There has so far been little knock-on effect on the smaller Panamax ships (5=
0,000 tonners), which have laboured around W130 since demand slackened off d=
uring the U.S. Independence day holidays.=20
Clean tanker trades are also moving upwards, with brokers pegging the 30,000=
 tonne upcoast trade at "W265 and rising" ($10.34 per tonne).

US West Daily Power Prices Flat Despite System Hiccups

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Prescheduled power prices in the western U.S. were mo=
stly unchanged Wednesday despite unplanned outages of several major units an=
d a weather forecast calling for higher temperatures Thursday, traders said.=
=20
Two generating units at Colstrip generating station with a combined capacity=
 of 1,008 megawatts tripped off line about 90 minutes before day-ahead tradi=
ng began Wednesday, but the units returned to the grid as trading was finish=
ing.=20
The 408-MW Craig unit 3 and 170-MW Four Corners unit 2 both tripped off the =
grid late Tuesday. The Four Corners unit returned to the grid late Tuesday m=
orning and the Craig unit is expected back in service Wednesday afternoon.
The 1,250-MW Columbia nuclear generator in Washington State entered start-up=
 overnight, but Bonneville Power Administration, which markets power from th=
e unit, was seen buying balance-of-the-week supplies. One trader said this m=
ight mean a slow ramp-up for the nuclear unit. Enron was also buying spot su=
pplies, staying in front of Bonneville, traders said.=20
On the demand side, traders are skeptical of the day-ahead forecast calling =
for warmer weather and higher air-conditioning demand. As one put it: "Every=
 morning for the past two weeks, we come in and have to lower the temperatur=
es from what we put in the day before."=20
Even if the forecast does pan out Thursday, it would raise air-conditioning =
loads only to the normal level for this time of year. As a result, day-ahead=
 traders are waiting to see a price impact in the real-time market before th=
ey are willing to bid up the day-ahead market much.=20
On-Peak/MWh One Day Earlier=20
Palo Verde, AZ $50.00-$62.00 $49.00-$60.00=20
South Path 15, CA 47.00- 51.50 46.50- 54.00=20

Mid-Columbia, WA 53.00- 58.00 53.00- 56.00=20

Looking ahead, weather forecasts call for higher temperatures Friday. As a r=
esult, air-conditioning load in the Western System Coordinating Council is e=
xpected to rise to 112% of normal for this time of year Friday from 103% of =
normal Thursday, according to forecaster Weather Derivatives Inc.=20

US Exim set to move SC on Dabhol row

NEW DELHI: The US Export-Import (Exim) Bank is set to move the Supreme Court=
 in a day or two, challenging the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commiss=
ion's (MERC) eligibility to adjudicate on the tariff row between the Enron-p=
romoted Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.=20
The move, being seen as indirect US pressure to expedite resolution of the i=
ssue, is likely to bolster the special leave petition (SLP) filed by DPC and=
 applications by its international lenders for the Supreme Court's intervent=
ion.
US Exim, which is a lender, is likely to base its application on the premise=
 that since the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB clearly stipul=
ates international arbitration in case of any dispute, MERC has no role to p=
lay in its resolution.=20
It may also cite Section 52 of the PPA that makes it clear the `conferral' o=
f jurisdiction under Section 22 (1)(C) and (D) and Section 22 (2)(N) ``would=
 override the provisions of all other substantive as well as procedural laws=
 of India, including the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,=
 1996''.=20
It is also likely to take the stand that for a stable and predictable busine=
ss environment, it is essential that arbitration agreements are upheld and a=
ny party should not be allowed to frustrate this through ``collateral procee=
dings''.=20
Eleven international lenders on Friday had urged the court to hear DPC's pet=
ition against a Bombay High Court order referring the dispute to MERC. The i=
nternational lenders have a Rs 2,088 crore ($444 million) exposure, based on=
 a conversion rate of Rs 47 to a dollar, in the Rs 12,000 crore ($3 billion)=
 power project.=20
With their application, the international lenders have made it clear that th=
ey are running out of patience. They have said in their application that the=
 Supreme Court should intervene to end the uncertainty over enforceability o=
f arbitration pacts and pave the way for early resolution of the issue.=20
Enron, DPC's main promoter, has about $700 million exposure, or 65 per cent =
equity, in the project. It is now looking for an exit over a demand for rene=
gotiating the price for selling power.
