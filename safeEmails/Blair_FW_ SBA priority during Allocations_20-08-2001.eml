Gerry,

Per your request, this is a reminder to a conversation we had regarding the =
priority of SBA shippers at a given point during the allocation of that poin=
t.  It was discussed  and agreed that SBA shippers trying to pack/peak the s=
ystem should be given priority over Alternate and Interruptible during an al=
location. =20

In September, we will resume the Pack & Draft activity and it would be helpf=
ul to have this procedure  in place.  Let me know if there is any other info=
rmation that you need.

Thank you for your help in this matter.
