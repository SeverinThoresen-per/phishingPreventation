Agree with the first paragraph.

Bets get tougher from here.  Not so obvious and require much larger size to =

 we should revisit limits, particularly if we need to offer up to Lavo and c=
rew the best bet for Enron's risk capital. =20

As an aside, I think the best bet may be gas.  Regarding gas, I'm thinking t=
