Dear Amber, Alfredo and Fabio,
many thanks for the opportunity of visiting Enron in Houston.
Your colleagues provided me with a great lot of information and advice.
Rebecca Cantrell and Lynn Blair were very kind and helpful, in sparing their=
 time with me and in organizing other meetings with colleagues.
They are very fine and I appreciate.
Maybe we would discuss, should the occasion come, some of the aspects of ope=
n access in the USA and their appropriateness for the italian case.
Best Regards
Mauro Formaggio
