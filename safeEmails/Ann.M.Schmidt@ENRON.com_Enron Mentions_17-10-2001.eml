Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)
2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''
