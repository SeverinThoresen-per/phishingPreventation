I am following up on Bill's request for information related to the Southern=20

you know, ENA has an unsecured claim for $25,334.  An objection to the claim=

was filed, but later withdrawn.  First distributions were made in this=20
bankruptcy in October, but the objection to ENA's claim may still have been=20
pending at that time, so that ENA would not have received a distribution. =20
The next distribution will be in January  and the distributions will occur=20
quarterly thereafter.  If we did not receive a distribution in October, we=20
will get both our first and second distributions in January.  ENA is a Class=

principal amount of the debt paid without interest over time.

I am familiar with the Southern Mineral Corp. bankruptcy.  ENA filed a proof=
=20
of claim for an unsecured debt in the amount of $25,334.  As far as I have=20
been able to determine, no objection was filed to this proof of claim.  The=20
debtors' Chapter 11 plan of reorganization was approved by the Court on July=
=20
21, 2000.  Unsecured creditors were to receive some combination of stock and=

cash.  I have a call in to Debtors' counsel to find out when to expect=20
distributions, but I have not yet heard back.  I will let you know as soon a=
s=20
I do.

I am not familiar with the Alma Energy Corp. bankruptcy.  We looked the=20
matter up in the bankruptcy court computer records, which show that Alma=20
Energy Corp. and an affiliated company, Equinox Oil Company, Inc. filed for=20
bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Louisiana in June 1999.  The docket=20
sheet reflects that a first meeting of creditors was set for August 1999. =20
The only other entry in the docket sheet reflects that the bankruptcy was=20
closed in December 1999.  The current telephone directory has a listing for=20
Equinox Oil Company at the 10077 Grogans Mill Road address that appears in=20
the bankruptcy records, but there is no current telephone listing for Alma. =

It appears that Alma has simply gone out of business.  We did place a call t=

the lawyer who was listed as Debtors' counsel in the bankruptcy to try to=20
find out more.  I will let you know if I find anything further.

Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to mak=

get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a=20

Please advise.

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following=20
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was=20
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the=20
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in=20
bankruptcy proceedings. =20

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky
