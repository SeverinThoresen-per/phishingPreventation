Michelle:=20
In response to my firm-wide email regarding set off for WARN notice: I recei=
ved a plan that included the following language:
The severance benefits provided under this Plan (including any additional be=
nefits provided pursuant to authority reserved in [company] under the provis=
ions of this Plan) are the maximum benefits that [company] will pay.  To the=
 extent that any federal, state or local law, including, without limitation,=
 the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) and any other =
so-called "plant closing" laws, requires [company] to give advance notice or=
 make a payment of any kind to an Eligible Employee because of that Employee=
's involuntary termination due to a layoff, reduction in force, plant or fac=
ility closing, sale of business, change of control, or any other similar eve=
nt or reason, the benefits provided under this Plan shall be reduced by the =
amount of such payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to t=
he contrary, an Employee's Severance Benefits shall not be less than the amo=
unt required by WARN, and in the case of an Enhanced Severance Benefit, shal=
l not be less than the amount required by WARN plus an additional amount to =
be determined by the Employer.=20
Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if there is any big news at Enron.  Thing=
s appear to be moving fast.=20
