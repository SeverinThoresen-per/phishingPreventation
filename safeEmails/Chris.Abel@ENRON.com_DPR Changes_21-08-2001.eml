After close discussions with David Port and the RAC-Market Risk group, we ha=
ve redesigned the Business Unit and Commodity DPR's to follow the new Risk T=
rading Policy.  This new policy took effect Wednesday, the 15th of August, a=
nd required a restructuring of the Business Unit structures and associated l=
imits, along with creation of new Concentration limits on the Concentration =
DPR, formerly the Commodity DPR.

For any questions about the new format, please contact Shona Wilson, x39123,=
 or myself, x33102, in the Global Risk Operations group, or David Port, x398=
23, in the RAC-Market Risk group.

Thank you,

Chris Abel
Manager
Global Risk Controls
