Carol:
How would the following work for you --  1-1:30 pm your time tomorrow
afternoon or either 8:30 - 9:00 am or  1-1:30 your time on Thursday?  Mike
Roach and I are in different cities, so if you and Ed Sacks are able to be
at the same number, it may be easiest for me to initiate the call.

Regards,
Keith Ferguson
