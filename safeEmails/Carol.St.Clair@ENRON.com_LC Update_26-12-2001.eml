Bill and Ed:

Here's an update:

- Enserco Energy has renewed their LC.  I should be getting a faxed copy sho=
rtly and bill will receive the original.
- Kim Theriot confirmed that there are no outstanding trades with Simpson Ta=
coma Kraft Company.
- Leslie Reeves confirmed that there are no outstanding amounts due by Metro=
media Energy.  Has anyone found the LC?  I have asked Kim T. to locate the t=
rade docs.
- Leslie Reeves confirmed that The Energy Authority closed out their positio=
ns with ENA.
- Energy Production Corp.'s LC automatically renews  for 1 year periods unle=
ss we received a notice from Chase of its intention not to renew 90 days pri=
or to expiration.

Is all of this info consistent with credit's records?

That leaves Niagra Mohawk Energy Marketing, El Paso Electric, Rising Star En=
ergy LLC and LG&E Energy Marketing.  Out of those CP's, only LG&E owes us a =
payment.  I am waiting to hear back from Leslie regarding payments owed by N=
iagra and Rising Star.   I have asked Kim to sends me the trading docs from =
Niagra.


Alan Aronowitz is working with someone in credit or settlements on the Vitol=
 LC.
