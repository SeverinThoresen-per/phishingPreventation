Joe,

Since you asked for my input on the ring, I have given it some more
thought.  Perhaps it would be best if you just gave her things back and
start over.  Twelve thousand, although a lot of money, is a small price to
pay for your freedom.  I know you mentioned that you couldn't get home for
the holiday.  What days are you working?

On another note, you will be happy to know that you have left your mark on
me.  Although I haven't joined the pro golf circuit, I have developed an
appreciation for good sushi!

Hope all is well.  Have a great day!

Christine
