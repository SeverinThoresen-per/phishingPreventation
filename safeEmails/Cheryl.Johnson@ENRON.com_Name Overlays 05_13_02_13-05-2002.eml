The following name overlays were completed in GCP this morning.  I have been=
 unable to update the report in Livelink, due to technical problems, which w=
ill hopefully be resolved tomorrow, May 14.  If additional information is re=
quired in the meantime, please contact me.

These changes are as a result of a merger between PanCanadian Energy Corpora=
tion and Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd., effective 04/05/02.  The combined =
entity was renamed EnCana Corporation.

CP ID	FROM					TO				Effective Date

Please note:  PanCanadian Energy Corporation did not previously exist as a g=
lobal counterparty record.  Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd. still exists in =
that name, as a subsidiary of EnCana Corporation.  EnCana Corporation was cr=
eated as a non-trading entity in GCP under CP ID 200474.
