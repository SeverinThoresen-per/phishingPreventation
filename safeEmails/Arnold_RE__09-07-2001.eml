John:
Here is my analysis of my guys:
Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has=
 run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the yea=
r and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you ge=
t killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 30=
00 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap=
 down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have b=
een really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of=
 the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs =
low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too react=
ionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market =
making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  W=
ould like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because =
present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spe=
nd all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griffith to allow h=
im to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite po=
sition of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of =
a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.  =
Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot function without on=
e of us on the desk. =20
Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.
