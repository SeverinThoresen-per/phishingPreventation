Subject: The Plan!

We have started to contact EnronOnline customers with regard to the EBS=20
connection to EnronOnline - I am pretty sure that the strategy is as set out=
=20
below.  Please let me know if anyone thinks differently.

The connections will be T1, as opposed to larger DS3 connections.  Originall=
y=20
it had been envisaged that DS3s would be provisioned in order to then upsell=
=20
rich content.  As EnronOnline only requires a T1 or less, it has been decide=
d=20
that at this time, it would be more appropriate to provision the T1s.

EBS will contract directly for the full connection service with the=20
EnronOnline customer (eg Dynegy and EBS). =20

EBS will bill the customer directly in accordance with the cost sharing=20
arrangement which the EnronOnline team negotiates with the customer.  For=20
example, EnronOnline pays for the network portion with the customer paying=20
for the local loop and any router charges.

Customers will receive the connection in approximately 45 (+ or minus 15=20
days).

EBS currently has a list of all companies to be connected in Phase 1.  (Davi=
d=20
Mims)

EBS to furnish EnronOnline with the costs as soon as possible in order for=20
EnronOnline to agree a cost sharing arrangement with its customers.

Should work I think - we look forward to faster trading.
