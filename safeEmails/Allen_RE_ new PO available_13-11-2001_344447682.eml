Jim,

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough=
 time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show w=
hy the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am ma=
king about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are in=
correct.

Phillip

Phillip,

Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to
check out the Heritage Building.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come
back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about
30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had
designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so
today he released this one.

The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we
have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend
of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn
down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.

I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can
supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know
soon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills
