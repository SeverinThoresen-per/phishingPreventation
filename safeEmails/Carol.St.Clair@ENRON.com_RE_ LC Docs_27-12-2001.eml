Here are drafts of the Certificates and Sight Drafts for Niagara Mohawk, El =
Paso electric, LG&E Energy Marketing and Energy Production Corp. (just in ca=
se it wasn't renewed).  I have put together files for each of these that inc=
lude copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence th=
at has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the =
invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to b=
e any other special requirements.  Leslie Reeves will be faxing the invoices=
 to us.  I will be in tomorrow until around 11.  Thanks for your help on thi=
s.
