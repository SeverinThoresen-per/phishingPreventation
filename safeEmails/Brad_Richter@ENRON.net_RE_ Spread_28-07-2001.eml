I spoke to Mark and he outlined 2 potential fixes to the spread dilemma.  We=
 can leave it the way it is (with some clarifying changes to the description=
s) or we can ask either the gas or the power desk to completely change their=
 products.  Neither one is a very elegant solution.  Jay and I are schedulin=
g meetings with each of the desks over the next few weeks, and I would like =
to take that opportunity to diligence the issue in person with the traders. =
 In short, we're working on it.

Brad

We have some inconsistency in the way we are doing spreads it was OK when it=
 was US and UK but now we are doing it different ways here.   Andy will tell=
 you that this was sort of forseen.  We do need to sort out something - mayb=
e more in the short description which helps to indentify what you are buying=
 and what you are selling.

Mark Taylor is the guy to talk to .
