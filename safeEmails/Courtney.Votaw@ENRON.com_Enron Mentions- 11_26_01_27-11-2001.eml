IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no lon=
ger trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goe=
s to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that =
milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book v=
alue.=20
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may=
 mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can'=
t place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sh=
eet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving imp=
lications for any attempt to value the company fairly.=20
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about =
$4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In ot=
her words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders wo=
uld get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into =
cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left =
over to shareholders.=20
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For=
 comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades=
 at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor =
of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio =
of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. =
(CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash.=20
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that =
Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron w=
ill have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders=
 would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to =
about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge=
 premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication=
 of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its cur=
rent form.=20
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is t=
rading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel the=
y can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Thos=
e numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing E=
nron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and pric=
e-to-earnings ratios.=20
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with =
Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships =
from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the=
 ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the=
 company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind i=
ts transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five=
 years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it r=
evealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadli=
ne to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been ex=
tended until Dec. 14.)=20
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to=
 fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you =
there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way ba=
d financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks=
, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come?=20
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reas=
on Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demon=
strations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a fi=
rm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly,=
 the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum =
level.=20
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron =
because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now=
 it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify=
 its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust=
 in their accuracy.=20

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status=
 of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't =
offering its opinion.=20
"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,=
" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice pr=
esident at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition o=
f its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to d=
iscuss the transaction.=20
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to commen=
t as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren=
't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached.=20
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion =
on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday.=20
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy w=
as continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory app=
roval of the deal.=20
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering info=
rmation as part of its due diligence efforts.=20
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to =
$1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The =
company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said.=20
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recentl=
y down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1=
=2E06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer=
 price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won'=
t get completed on its original terms.=20
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685=
 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based=
 on Dynegy's recent stock price.=20
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dyneg=
y offer.=20
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement.=20
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is =
secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's=
 near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can r=
emain solvent without any added investments.=20

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14

Of Dow Jones Newswires=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week form=
alized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan=
 by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that ow=
ns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron s=
aid last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to "BBB-=
" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27.=20
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan C=
hase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate =
a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron ba=
nk loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated=
 bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured.=20
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the p=
rocess of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the out=
standing portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people=
 familiar with the matter said.=20
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties abou=
t the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy=
 Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as =
Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% t=
o $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004=
 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.=20

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to En=
ron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27.=20
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is to=
o exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may hav=
e laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap t=
ransactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if=
 Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover propos=
ed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transaction=
s that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 =
billion in Enron exposure.=20
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, En=
ron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which toge=
ther raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yos=
emite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro=
 Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million.=20
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receiv=
es the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, =
purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the =
payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic =
securities ratings at Standard & Poor's.=20
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make paym=
ents on the notes, Ryan said.=20
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The s=
ingle-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup =
in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligat=
ions. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even s=
crap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfe=
r would appear to be rising.=20
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enr=
on bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true cr=
editors of Enron.=20
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual =
Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved=
 in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that =
Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with cre=
ditors.=20
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of tripl=
e-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service.=20
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect =
the downgrades in Enron's ratings.=20
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the t=
ransactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;=20

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at=
 least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lo=
st 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enro=
n stock.=20
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who=
 filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in=
 plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees =
knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment.=20
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also cont=
ends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus.=20
If proven, the sale without a prospectus "give workers the automatic right t=
o rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest," Gotte=
sdiener said in a statement.=20
Enron "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make adm=
inistrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as =
the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far l=
arger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a p=
iece, or about $9.2 billion.=20
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less t=
han expected and shares fell sharply.=20
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84=
=2E88 a share in December 2000.=20
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harriso=
n & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hag=
ens Berman LLP.=20

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. con=
tinued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of =
the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through.=20
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmornin=
g trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per =
share for Enron.
"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going throug=
h at the original terms," said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edw=
ards & Sons.=20
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as pla=
nned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely.=
=20
"Escape clauses" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option =
to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets.=
=20
"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has al=
ready been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, ear=
nings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness," he said.=20
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week=
 because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed un=
til mid-December.=20
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the cr=
own jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings =
raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability=
=2E Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy.=20
"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decrease=
s the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place," Heim=
 said. "Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?"=20
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships an=
d creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercis=
e its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline.=20
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to sw=
ap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy w=
ere down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade.=20
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of prob=
lems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its=
 officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit =
ratings.=20
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and=
 its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000.=20
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform,=
 is the premier property it once was.=20
"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate=
 it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron=
 had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes =
heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit e=
mployee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement pla=
ns.=20
"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings =
before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amo=
unt of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener=
 asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on be=
half of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated=
 $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts.=20
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breac=
hed its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its sto=
ck at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status=
=2E=20
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5=
 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures=
 about its deteriorating finances.=20
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employe=
es' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to h=
old the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50.=20
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirem=
ent accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retir=
ement plan's administrator.=20
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 pe=
rcent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) pla=
ns offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their po=
rtfolio in that stock.=20
"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional=
 defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobb=
y, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said.=20
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "complet=
ely indefensible," he said.=20
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by of=
fering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If=
 proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he sa=

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more =
wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the perf=
ect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy tra=
ding business one to watch in 2001.=20
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and =
fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was =
followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices wer=
e headed down, not up.=20
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the =
industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high ga=
s prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stoc=
ks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about wh=
ere traditional utilities trade.=20
And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is wi=
lling to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same pr=
ice-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently =
between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time=
 before the stocks get there.=20
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the =
governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of art=
ificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the stat=
e's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron."=20
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor d=
emand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he said=
=2E "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=
ility."=20
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions betw=
een the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies =
and financial disclosures.=20
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of account=
ing issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fa=
ult of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention pa=
id to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it=
 can create.=20
Answers Elude Investors=20

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they=
 want.=20
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of =
a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at=
 the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer perio=
d. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from t=
he position might not be the same value the company calculated in its origin=
al assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of =
the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the mar=
ket for the commodity isn't liquid.=20
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their ma=
rk-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpart=
s that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patt=
erson.=20
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call fo=
r added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companie=
s with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their ma=
rk-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls comp=
ared with those in the second quarter.=20
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely refl=
ect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with the=
m than earnings that do not," he said.=20
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earn=
ings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market a=
ccounting.=20
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but b=
eing able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who mana=
ges a pension fund.=20
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the e=
nergy merchants produce.=20
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy me=
rchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading position=
s should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditiona=
l utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the gro=
wth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices=
=2E=20
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Co=
rp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings=
 multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stoc=
ks.=20
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclica=
l these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple shoul=
d be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated o=
perations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in=
 the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of t=
he replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien.=
=20
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays," =
O'Brien said.=20
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the =
lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.=20

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals," A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to "growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely."

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is "not very favorable" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay "afloat" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%=
2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but "the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal."

Heim has a "sell" rating on the stock.
