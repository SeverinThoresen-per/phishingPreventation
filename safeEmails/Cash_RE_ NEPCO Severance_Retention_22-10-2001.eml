Good luck.

I would like the message to be even stronger than that -- he is not supposed=
 to hire any outside counsel at all, for anything -- that is supposed to be =
done through legal department, per Jim Derrick's strictly-enforced rules.  H=
e knows this and continues to violate that rule.  I suggest that he must hea=
r a strong message, with disciplinary potential if he does it again.  Otherw=
ise, this will have to be escalated to Derrick, since it continues to happen=
 again despite my requests that he not do it.

In fact, he never contacts me for anything, which makes me nervous.  I would=
 suggest that you would want him to have the same processes that we have in =
the rest of Enron regarding terminations of employment, which is that they g=
o through legal if they are for any reason other than ROF.  That way, we may=
 be able to catch some of the issues before they become more significant.  S=
imilarly, I would like to be informed of employee relations issues that coul=
d bubble up into legal concerns.  I don't have much optimism for this, but s=
till would like to ask for it!

Thanks for the response.  A face to face with Mike I sounds like a good idea=
=2E  Among other things, remind him to contact Michelle Cash when he intends=
 to use an outside counsel for legal matters.  Also, I'd like to review his =
2001 and 2002 HR Budget with you when you get your hands on it.

Gary

Saw the email you forwarded......someone's lost the plot here!

I had sent an email to Mike -hinting that there should no longer be a need f=
or retention (didnt want to go into print and actually say NEPCO was off the=
 table given there's still one interested buyer in play, and I havent yet th=
ought thru the impact of bringing in a partner).

Have now left two voicemails for Mike asking him to call to discuss.


Will be talking to Brian about it today, and will probably go up to Bothell =
for a day next week (mountains and Mohammad)! Also plan on getting together =
with Aaron and Lydecker early next week.

Will keep you posted
