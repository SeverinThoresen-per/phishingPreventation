Mike,

Let me first introduce myself -- I have responsiblity for a couple of sites =
in Louisiana as part of the Generation Development Group.  We are trying to =
determine if we should continue to develop these sites (permitting and inter=
connection) or just sit on the land options.  Obviously there is more cost a=
ssociated with the permitting and interconnection activity and we are at a c=
ritical juncture in both activities (whether to proceed or stop).  I would l=
ike to discuss at your earliest convenience.  The sites are located in Calca=
sieu and St. Charles Parishes. =20

Please call me x.39298.  Thanks, Ron Tapscott.
