Lynn and Steve,
 I think you can answer this question below on the posting. The question is =
when to post.
Can you get back to us & let us know?

Thanks Ramona

Ramona,

I sent her the approximate times the TW cycles are completed last week (belo=
w).  The issue she is having now is when to post.

1.  After the cycle is complete   or
2.  After confirmations are available.=20

Today we currently generate a new posting for Operationally Available every =
15 minutes to keep it constantly updated. But if we go to 4 times daily, whe=
n does she set the time to generate and post?  I'm probably not the one to a=
nswer this.  Someone needs to make the call which of the two times would be =
correct one to post.  Another issue is when we have system problems and the =
time gets thrown off and it has a set time to run, wouldn't this skew the av=
ailable capacity numbers?


This was my e-mail to Jeanie last week..........


They are generally set times, but there are times when we are having (TMS) s=
ystem problems that the times have to be pushed up. But as a general rule th=
e times that TMS cycles run are:  (This is for TW)
Evening Cycle: Runs at approximately 6:00 -  6:30 p.m and confirmations run =
at approximately 9:00p.m.
Non Grid: Runs at approximately 8:00 - 8:30 a.m.=20
Intraday 1: Runs at approximately 10:00 - 10:30a.m. confirmations run at app=
roximately 1:00p.m.
Intraday 2:  Runs at approximately 5:00 - 5:30 p.m. confirmations run at app=
roximately 8:00p.m.
Timely:  Runs at approximately 11:30 a.m  - 12:05 p.m. confirmations run at =
approximately 3:30p.m.

Toby,
Have you already covered this issue below from Jeanne. I am thinking that yo=
u and Mary and Marketing might have already discussed. If so, can you respon=
d back to Tina & Jeanne.

If you do not know, can we meet & discuss so we can get them an answer by Tu=
esday.
Thanks Ramona

Ramona,
Operational and Design Capacity Postings to the Internet and thru EDI is alr=
eady implemented in Production and to my knowledge does not have any issues =
that I am aware of in regards to the schedules.=20

The schedule for posting that I am referring to is for Unsubscribed Capacity=
=2E The meetings that were held with regards to Unsubscribed Capacity includ=
ed what to post, for how long and and the frequency of the postings. Today, =
Perry maintains and updates his Excel spreadsheet and the Internet team post=
s the Unsubscribed capacity every hour. In one of our meetings, it was decid=
ed that we would post 4 times a day with the automated feature rather than e=
very hour. From that I am trying to determine the times so that I can create=
 an automated schedule to have this data available. The schedule really only=
 applies to the Internet postings. EDI's schedule is when the customer sends=
 in a request for data.  If you can coordinate and finalize this schedule wh=
ile Dale is out, it will help us move forward. If you have any other questio=
ns, please call me as Tina is also out of the office until Tuesday.
Thanks,
Jeanne

Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to he=
lp follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cy=
cle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is di=
fferent on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocatio=
n is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule v=
olumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confir=
ms.=20

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting U=
nsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operatio=
nal available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after ea=
ch cycle.=20
Please let me know.
Thanks Ramona

Jeanne,

Unless there is any other comment we should post after the confirmations are=
 complete,  even if the noms are late.

I will be out of the office the week of 7/30 so please send your comments or=
 question to Bradley Holmes or Ramona Betancourt.

Thanks=20

Dale,
I need to know what is the schedule for the posting of the Unsubscribed. The=
se are the times the cycles run. Do we run when these are complete? Should w=
e post based on the confirmation time? Do we follow these times even if Noms=
 is late?

Thanks,
Jeanne=20
