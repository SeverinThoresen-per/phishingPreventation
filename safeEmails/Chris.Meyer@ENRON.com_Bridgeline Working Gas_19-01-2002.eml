Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cov=
er December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million). =
 Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a =
little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given=
 our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has in=
terruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 =
MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.

Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Ag=
reement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will=
 be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the e=
vent the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may=
 be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell=
, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport =
and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it acro=
ss the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transpo=
rt fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.

Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail whi=
ch stated "he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by r=
eleasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to=
 a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer sen=
d a draft of this document to Gerald." =20

Questions:
1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?
2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?

Let me know.
