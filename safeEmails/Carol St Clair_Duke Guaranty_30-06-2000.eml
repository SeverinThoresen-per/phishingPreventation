Mary:
After reviewing heir form of Guaranty, I would prefer that we use our=20
multi-product form.  Their form is more suited to guarantees of debt.  If=20
they insist on using our form , I would be happy to mark it up but the=20
mark-up would be fairly substantial.  Let me know what you want to do.

Carol=20
