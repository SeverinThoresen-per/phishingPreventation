PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK=20
PRODUCT


 Here's an update.  I have included Janice because of the overlap of some of=
=20
the items:

1.  David Best is working on a very short draft reply to Mitsubishi's=20
recently-received position in this matter, and will speak with Matt re the=20
wording before requesting authority to send it out.  I will circulate it to=20
you for your approval once I see the final draft.

2.  We still have not been advised by Mitsubishi who their lawyer or chemist=
=20
will be in this matter.  We know that Mitsubishi recently tried to retain=20
Tony Rooth of Watson, Farland, who was conflicted out because of the role of=
=20
Watson, Farland's Singapore office in this matter.  We expect that the delay=
=20
is attributable to the internal procedures at Mitsubishi that come into play=
=20
when retaining outside representatives.

3.  Although the joint survey is tentatively scheduled for the week of Augus=
t=20
21-25, that may slide, given that ECT's chemist, Steve Jones, and the cargo=20
underwriters' chemist, Cliff Bennett of Minton's, have not finalized the=20
testing program that they will jointly submit to whoever Mitsubishi appoints=
=20
as its surveyor. I agree with David that it is critical to (a) get the=20
program right  and (b) make sure the lab (and lab technician) is capable of=20
handling this testing.  The results of the joint survey will obviously have =
a=20
significant impact on this case.

4.  Best anticipates that Steve Jones and Cliff Bennett will ultimately=20
recommend that ASTM D 3605 with and without ashing be used (I have previousl=
y=20
reported this).

5. In response to Matt's question about which testing method will prevail, I=
=20
agree with David that from the standpoint of resolution of the cargo=20
contamination case, we will not be in a position to determine this until=20
after the testing is done and the results analyzed.

6. I have spoken with Best about Janice's comments to me about the risk of=20
the substantial e-mail traffic in this case leading to inadvertent disclosur=
e=20
of otherwise privileged material.  We are both very open to communicating=20
strictly by telefax or letter (or memo, with respect to my communications to=
=20
each of you), if that does not impose an undue burden on anyone else.  Janic=
e=20
and Matt, would you let me know what thoughts/concerns  you have about this=20
concept and/or how to implement it?

7. Janice has also mentioned that in resolving the cargo contamination=20
matter, we need to be mindful of the confidentiality provisions of the FGH=20
contract.  It strikes me that we will need to introduce some evidence of our=
=20
contractual obligations to FGH and at least a specific description of the=20
accompanying specifications in arbitration in order to recover.  Under Londo=
n=20
arbitration, documents that are received in the course of discovery are=20
reportedly always treated as confidential and may not be disclosed without=20
the consent of the party who produces the document.  Janice, I'll give you a=
=20
call to discuss whether production by ECT to Mitsubishi of the terms of the=20
FGH agreement under these circumstances runs afoul of the confidentiality=20
provision.  =20

I welcome your comments and will continue to keep you advised.

       Britt
