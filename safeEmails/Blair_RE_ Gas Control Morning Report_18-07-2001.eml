Don,
Last week we talked about the Net IDD number displayed on the referenced rep=
ort and the benefits of displaying the Net PNR activity separately from Net =
Packet activity. As a follow-up to that conversation I was able to confirm t=
hat the Service Sub Type in CMS was used to differentiate PNR contracts from=
 Packets agreements in TMS.
PNR has No Contract "Service Sub Type"
Packets have a Service Sub Type of "A" (Seasonal), "B" (Backdraft) or "U" (O=
ther). The Packet activity can be combined and reported as one number.=20
In addition, I have asked Contracts to establish Service Sub Types of Tradit=
ional, Non Traditional, and Storage for Service Type: SBA Pack/Draft so that=
 Pack & Draft activity can be reported separately from the other activity. I=
t is my  recommendation that the SBA line on the subject report be changed t=
o report Peak activity (Service Type: SBA Winter Peaking) separately from Tr=
aditional Pack/Draft. The Non Traditional and Storage Pack/Draft should be u=
sed in calculating the Unanticipated Swing but should not be displayed on th=
e report.
If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please call me  =
  =20
