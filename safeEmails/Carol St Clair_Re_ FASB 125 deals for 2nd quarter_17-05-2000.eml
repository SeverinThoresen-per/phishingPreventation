As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this=20
quarter: =20

1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0=20
structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound=20
completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if=
=20
the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that=
=20
the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using=20
the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st.=20

2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in=20
the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of=20
an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close=20
around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31=20
transaction to Sara today.

That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals. =
 =20
Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any=20
other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.

Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distributio=
n=20
list for docs.

Thanks,
B
