There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked o=
ut (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there=
 is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing=
 and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to m=
e by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spe=
nd' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will =
'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. F=
or example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on th=
e Rams, and $5 on the Broncos.=20

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subt=
otal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10=
, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams=
 win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amo=
unt toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now=
, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Stan=
ding? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are al=
so thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. =
Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is int=
erested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad
