I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last F=
riday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future al=
l-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best f=
or all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have =
worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so =
that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I =
hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two =
videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enj=
oy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions=
 and have time for questions and answers. =20
