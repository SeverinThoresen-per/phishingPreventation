Subject:	Havre Pipeline Outsourcing Update


Over the past several weeks we have had several meetings regarding Ocean's H=
avre Pipeline system.  We have met with Greg Nelson, the Ocean accountant wh=
o handles all the day to day and monthly settlement activities on the Havre =
Pipeline. In addition, we have had several internal meeting to discuss this =
potential opportunity.  Ocean was interested in possibly outsourcing the sch=
eduling, balancing and other back office activities related to the Havre Pip=
eline.  Based upon these internal and external meetings the following concer=
ns and/or issues were raised.=20

According to ENN, with the sale of HPL, ENA no longer has the internal exper=
tise to manage the daily logistics and monthly settlements associated with a=
 small intrastate pipeline.   It is not a core part of ENA's back office fun=
ctions.  Obviously, Enron's GPG has the expertise to operate large interstat=
e pipelines.  I have contacted Brad Holmes to determine if GPG  has any inte=
rest in this type opportunity.
It was stated that ENA could perform the services, but since the required se=
rvices are not core to our back office that it would not be efficient for  E=
NA to perform the services.  The tasks to manage, balance and account for th=
e transactions on the Havre Pipeline currently consume only  25% to 50% of G=
reg Nelson's time.  It was thought that it cost more for ENA to provide the =
required services than for Ocean to continue to do it themselves. =20
The proposed transaction made more sense when connected to an HMS wellhead a=
utomation project.  HMS bid on installing 300 EFMs which would have been a m=
ilestone project for HMS.  However, as a standalone outsourcing transaction =
it is not as attractive.
Outsourcing the back office functions on the Havre Pipeline is not high prio=
rity for Ocean.  It was more of a "side bar" to the wellhead automation proj=
ect which has been postponed.=20
          =20
 Given that the proposed transaction is not core to ENA's back office, is a =
very small transaction and does not integrate with another component of the =
Producer One program, I do not think ENA should pursue this transaction at t=
his time.  GPG may desire to pursue the transaction.  However, based upon my=
 preliminary discussions with Brad Holmes I do not think GPG is very interes=
ted.  If Ocean decides to go forward with their EFM project in the spring, I=
 think ENA should review the potential transaction at that time. =20

ENA future opportunities with Ocean should not be impacted by our decision n=
ot to pursue this transaction.  Ocean did not initially want to outsource th=
e back office functions of the Havre Pipeline.  Ocean should respect ENA's h=
onest evaluation of the situation.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext 33541.

Thanks  ... Kevin
