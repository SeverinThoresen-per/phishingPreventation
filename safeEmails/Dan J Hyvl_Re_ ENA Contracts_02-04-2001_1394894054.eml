If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, the=
n=20
that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing busines=
s=20
with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same=20
contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.

Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do w=
e=20
have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example,=20
if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a=20
separate contract or do we use the same contract?

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done=
=20
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its=20
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract=
=20
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL=20
sale to AEP.

Dan,

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA? =20

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas=20
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle=20
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We=20
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with=20
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place=20
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts i=
n=20
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?
