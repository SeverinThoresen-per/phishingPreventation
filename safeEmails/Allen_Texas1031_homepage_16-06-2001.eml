Carlos,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your offic=
e and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly. =20

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months=
 ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July=
 18th. =20

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment o=
f a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that mig=
ht qualify.=20

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd f=
or $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the=
 land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily p=
roject.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership =
was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  An=
other investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation t=
o be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a cre=
ative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000. =
 I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope t=
o receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this=
 property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the=
 property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to =
a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece =
of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding=
 property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then=
 move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.
