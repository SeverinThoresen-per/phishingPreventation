Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It=

might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day=

to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do =
a=20
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant=20
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?
