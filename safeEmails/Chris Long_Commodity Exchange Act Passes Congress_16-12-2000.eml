Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures=20
Modernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate=20
unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities=20
falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA") and the=
=20
provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives=20
transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product=
=20
innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets.=20
Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product=20
innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal=20
certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an=20
over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic tradin=
g=20
platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.

Bilateral Transactions

Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than=20
agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on =
a=20
multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as=20
the transactions are entered solely between "eligible contract=20
participants"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital=20
thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentiall=
y=20
codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward=20
contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has=20
frustrated product innovation and growth. =20

Multilateral Transactions

In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract o=
r=20
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as=20
they the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", are=20
entered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on a=20
multi-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansio=
n=20
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal=20
requirements will have to be met.

Other Transactions

The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are=20
of interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weathe=
r=20
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet=
=20
certain legal thresholds.

This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective=20
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that hav=
e=20
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a=20
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not=20
