Thanks for forwarding the note to me.  I have asked Shona and Brent to get b=
ack with me on answers to your questions.  Shona's team did move this weeken=
d to ECS (as did I), and I am not sure how much additional chaos this has ad=
ded to her life for today!  I will follow up with her mid -afternoon on deta=
ils. =20

I agree with you that this serves as a good case study  - underscores indeed=
 that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead=
 of continuing to document problems.  By definition,  to arrive at complete =
and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to RisktR=
AC, we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets.  --Sally=20

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and th=
e need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on =
a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positi=
ons to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make correct=
ions.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this =
is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain ho=
w long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limi=
ted to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures.=20

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the=
 scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discus=
s this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how=
 long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impac=
t on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I be=
lieve it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what =
you think.

Thanks,
Wanda
