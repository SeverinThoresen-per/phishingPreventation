My comments on the floating price source language follows:

US NG     BasisSwp Chicago  The floating price is shown to be equal to the=20
"monthly average" price published in NGI's Bidweek        Survey.  The=20
floating price is more appropriately described as the "Bidweek Average"=20
price.  This        appears to be an oversight on Dynegydirect's part since=20
their description for US NG     BasisSwp         SCalBrd correctly describes=
=20
the price as the "bidweek average" price.  =20
Any Gas Daily daily midpoint price description The floating price is shown t=
o=20
be equal to the "midpoint price published in the applicable issue". =20
Gas        Daily is not published on weekends or holiday, therefore the=20
question arises as to the pricing mechanism        Dynegydirect will use for=
=20
those days.  We add the phrase to our floating price description as follows=20
to        answer that point:  "if a calendar day is not a businress day then=
=20
the price for such day will be the Midpoint        price published on the=20
next succeeding business day" =20

Leslie,

The following comments are with respect to all Basis Swap product=20
descriptions on the DynegyDirect trading web site.

1.  The reference to the "fixed price" is incorrect as it references the=20
basis spread price specified on the trading screen rather than the second=20
floating price which should be one of the NYMEX futures contracts.  This is =
a=20
structural error that was carried through all the basis swap definitions and=
=20
should be fixed to avoid ambiguity or future arguments over what was=20
intended.=20

2.  In the new definition of "fixed price"  all references should be made to=
=20
either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contracts for the=20
applicable Determination Period rather than to the "appropriate NYMEX future=
s=20
contract".   Otherwise it will not be clear which natural gas futures=20
contract is being referred to.

3.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be=20
preferable to define "Determination Period" in the product description by=20
adding the following sentence, "Each calendar month during the term of the=20
Transaction will be a Determination Period."

4.  The sentence specifying the definition of the "Price" should specify tha=
t=20
the "Price is the differential between the Floating Price and the Fixed Pric=
e=20
(or Fixed Price and the Floating Price). =20

5.  The sentence relating to payment dates should specify that the amounts=20
owed should be paid no later than "five business days after the Floating=20
Price and the Fixed Price are published."

 I would suggest that Dynegy borrow the language from our long product=20
descriptions on EOL.=20



The following comments are with respect to the  "FP Swap NYMEX" product=20
descriptions.

1.  In the definition of the "floating price" all references should be made=20
to either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contract for the=20
applicable Determination Period rather than to the "appropriate NYMEX future=
s=20
contract".   It is not clear which natural gas futures contract is being=20
referenced.

2.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be=20
preferable to define "Determination Period" in the product description by=20
adding the following sentence, "Each calendar month during the term of the=20
Transaction will be a Determination Period."



As we do not have a master agreement in place with Dynegy Liquids Marketing =
&=20
Trade I would not approve trading in the liquids financial products includin=
g=20
the "C2 Swap Fix OPIS C2 MON" and "NC4ISO Swap Fix OPIS NON MON" products=20
until either a master is agreed to or the GTC form of master is approved. =20
Please let us know if the commercial team wants to pursue trading these=20
products.


Bob has agreed to review the definitions of the floating prices to ensure=20
that they correctly identify the floating price sources.  I will forward him=
=20
copies of the long form descriptions today.  Other than having Bob check the=
=20
floating price source language I do not have any comments on the two=20
swingswap definitions.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
Brent
