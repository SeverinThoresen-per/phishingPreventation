Subject:	Weekend Events.........

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'=
m going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing=
 problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUS=
D-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called G=
D-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench repor=
t but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primar=
y/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-m=
onth curve either (OMICRON). =20

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /second=
ary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we=
 expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of h=
is positions.  But the desired results were not achieved. =20

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several di=
fferent combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do=
 not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var=
=2E  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no pos=
itions in it. =20

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices=
 associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also t=
hat AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own=
 but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AEC=
O/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes. =20

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, d=
espite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and ha=
ve gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our effor=
ts this is still a problem that needs addressing. =20

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I hav=
e to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I w=
ant us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas V=
aR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with ve=
ry few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the dif=
ferent curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to =
identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take tim=
e and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none=
 of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, m=
ost of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned par=
ties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay=
 we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this? =20

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Regards

Bharat
