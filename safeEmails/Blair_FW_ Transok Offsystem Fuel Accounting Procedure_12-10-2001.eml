Subject:	RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state "Pipelines acquiring =
upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be "at-risk" for th=
e cost of that capacity".  This means that Northern will need to track both =
the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe t=
hat in tracking the revenues we can track by contract. =20

	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transa=
ctions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system tr=
ansactions.

	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would tr=
ack the revenues thru the accounting side. =20

	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yeste=
rday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations=
, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where =
we are as things develop.  thanks MW

Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accoun=
ting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.

Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expect=
ed to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No acc=
ounting entry made to the G/L.

Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kin=
d fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occ=
urs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF =
to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recordin=
g it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas p=
urchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsyst=
em Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF wou=
ld not be affected.

Recorded in December:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 =3D $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwa=
rded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to t=
he Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reporte=
d to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements a=
re needed.

If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000=
 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3r=
d party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operationa=
l Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue tw=
o invoices.


Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind re=
placement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to=
 NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No acc=
ounting entry made to the G/L.
NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.

Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 =3D $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, =
but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes p=
lace but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).=20
