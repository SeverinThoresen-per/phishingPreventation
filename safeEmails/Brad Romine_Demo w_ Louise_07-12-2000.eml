Hey Tom and Sally,
 I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen=20
yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal=20
loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future=20
enhancements.

 Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the=20
process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help=20
make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for=20
early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process=20
rolling.
=20
 The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not=20
like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the=20
look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as=
=20
possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the=
=20
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue=
=2E

 Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually=20
said we did an excellent job.
=20
 Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical=20
Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market=20
where we could make money, where Enron has enough volume that we could reall=
y=20
relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids,=20
Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justif=
y=20
the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as=20
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP=20
data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics,=20
exporting data, and finally automatching.

Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with=20
the site and our progress to date.

Brad
