Enron Sues California Senate; Panel Urges Contempt (Update2)

Enron Sues California Senate; Panel Urges Contempt (Update2)

     (Adds committee vote in 2nd paragraph, lawmaker comment in
7th paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, July 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
the world's largest energy trader, sued a California state Senate
committee to quash a subpoena for internal documents, accusing the
panel of trying to blame the company for the state's power woes.
     The Senate panel responded by voting for a second time to
recommend the full state Senate hold Enron in contempt and impose
fines or other punishments if the company refuses to turn over the
documents. The vote was 6-0.
     Enron is fighting a committee subpoena issued last month
demanding thousands of pages of documents relating to the
company's energy trading in California. The panel is probing
whether generators manipulated the power market. Soaring wholesale
prices last year left utilities unable to buy power, and the state
began purchasing energy on their behalf.
     ``It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the
committee's actions are designed to uncover the facts underlying
the price spikes in California's wholesale market, or to create a
convenient political scapegoat,'' Enron Executive Vice President
Steven Kean wrote in a letter to the committee.
     The full Senate won't receive the committee's recommendation
until next week, giving Enron time to turn over the documents,
said Committee Chairman Senator Joseph Dunn, a Democrat.
     ``The next move is now up to Enron,'' Dunn said.

                         The Lawsuit

     Enron's suit claims that federal regulators have sole
jurisdiction over wholesale energy trading and that the Senate
subpoena is too broad, according to a copy of the suit released by
Enron. Enron also accused the committee of singling it out for
blame when dozens of companies sold power to the state.
     The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation
in the Wholesale Energy Market voted last month to hold Enron
Corp. and Mirant Corp. in contempt after they refused to turn over
documents the committee was seeking. The committee gave the
companies until today to comply.
     Mirant has already turned over 160,000 pages of documents,
said Larry Drivon, special counsel to the committee. The committee
voted to nullify the contempt charge against the company.
      California claims energy generators and traders overcharged
the state by $8.9 billion. Talks ordered by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to settle those allegations broke down
earlier this week without an agreement.
     Energy generators and traders had offered California a total
of $716 million in refunds.
     FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner asked federal
regulators to determine appropriate refunds, if any.
     California Governor Gray Davis said that if the state isn't
awarded the full $8.9 billion in refunds, it would file suit
against the energy companies.
     ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion
in refunds, we will see you in court,'' Davis said yesterday.

Enron Won't Rule Out Sale of Dabhol Gas Unit, Spokesman Says
2001-07-11 15:48 (New York)

Enron Won't Rule Out Sale of Dabhol Gas Unit, Spokesman Says

     Houston, July 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which is seeking
a way to resolve a dispute over a $3 billion Indian power project,
hasn't ruled out selling its liquefied natural gas operations
there to government-owned Gas Authority of India Ltd., spokesman
John Ambler said.
     Enron is building liquefied gas facilities to process fuel
for Dabhol Power Co., the Enron unit that owns the power project
in Maharashtra state. Enron and the Indian government have
discussed a sale of the gas facilities, the Business Standard
newspaper reported on its Web site, citing unidentified people.
The report followed a visit to India by Enron Chairman Kenneth
Lay, who has been holding talks with officials in New Delhi.
     ``In the discussions we had with the central government, a
whole range of possibilities was discussed,'' Ambler said. ``We're
definitely not on any kind of single track.''
     The Business Standard report also said the government and Lay
discussed the possibility of India's National Thermal Power Corp.
taking over Dabhol. India National Thermal would get a 16 billion
rupee ($339 million) tax break because it's a local company,
allowing it to sell power at lower rates, the paper said.
      Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power, India's largest
private foreign investment. The utility and its sole customer, the
state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board, are in the midst
of a 7-month-old dispute over 3 billion rupees ($64 million) in
unpaid bills by the board, and the price Dabhol charges for power.
     The gas terminal is part of a $2 billion expansion of the
Dabhol plant. Some contractors, saying they haven't been paid
since April, halted work on the power plant. Construction of
liquefied gas facilities wasn't affected because another crew is
handling that work.
     The Dabhol plant now burns naphtha, a chemical refined from
crude oil. Switching to natural gas will lower power prices,
Ambler said. High prices are the crux of the Maharashtra board's
dispute with the utility. The board says Dabhol charges more than
double the rates of other Indian generators.
     Dabhol has long-term liquefied gas contracts totaling 2
million metric tons a year with Oman Liquefied Natural Gas Co.,
Oman's state owned gas company, and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction
Ltd., a unit of state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. of the
United Arab Emirates.
     In a statement issued as he was leaving India today, Lay said
Enron had been ``involved in a range of meetings with political
leaders, government officials, business leaders and other
interested parties'' designed to resolve the Dabhol dispute.
     General Electric Co. and private construction company Bechtel
Group are partners in the Dabhol project, which is being financed
by loans backed the U.S. and Japanese governments, as well as
Indian lenders, Lay said. Forty ``of the world's top
corporations'' are involved in the project, he said.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 22 cents to $49 in late
trading.
