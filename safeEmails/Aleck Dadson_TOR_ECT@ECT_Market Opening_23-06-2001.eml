Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a s=
olution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit =
(515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that tim=
e.=20

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 500=
MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the On=
tario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something =
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, follo=
wing Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term she=
et to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap str=
ucture.=20

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September r=
eadiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall =
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and t=
he OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce=
 a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the =
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a positi=
on that one LDC  could halt market opening.=20

Regards
Rob
