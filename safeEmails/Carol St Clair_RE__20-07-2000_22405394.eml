Sue - Russell and I exchanged voicemails yesterday on the status. I reviewed
the revised drafts. I don't think we're at a point to finalize. Russell and
Eqt. Energy's Elmore Patterson have not reached closure on credit
provisions. I think the other changes in the draft are generally ok or need
a little clarification, e.g. I don't see the relevance of adding Part 6(g)
and (h) as we don't trade in pulp or paper. Please let me know if we need to
discuss. Thanks. Henry. (412-553-7711)

Henry:
Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we
discussed,
I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
and I
have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
the
chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity
leave
at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get
this
finalized.
