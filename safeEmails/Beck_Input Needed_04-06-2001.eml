What do you think?  I have never been crazy about the Commercial Support tag=
 myself.  Do you like professional services?  Or do you have another suggest=
ion.  Please send me your comments within the next day or so.  I would like =
to get back to David Oxley soon.  Thanks.  --Sally=20

Subject:	Proposal to Change "Commercial Support" peer group label to "Profes=
sional Services"

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider ret=
itling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestio=
n was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks a=
go. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively acros=
s the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change=
, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colle=
agues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before ret=
urning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you=
 would provide me with your views and a vote for or against?=20

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small c=
ircle of people.

David
