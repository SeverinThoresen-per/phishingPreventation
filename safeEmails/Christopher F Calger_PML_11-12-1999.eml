FYI:  The PML valuation process resulted in incremental "value" which can be=
=20
taken into income.  I told Juanita and Andrea that it would be ridiculously=20
imprudent to take any more income.  Andrea and her analytics staff tend to=20
agree with me but Delainey is on to it and will likely push to take it.  I=20
told Ondarza and Delainey that I will not sign off on it.  Without my=20
signature, Delainey may end up calling you.  ENA has a Q4 hole that Cliff is=
=20
trying to fill.  The income that ENA may try to squeeze from PML is=20
US$2-4MM. =20

On a related matter, Paul wants to take over the Board responsibilities (and=
=20
overall management) of the deal.  Paul is comfortable with the value=20
recognized to date, and agrees with us that we should not take any more. =20
Given the related income form energy management (C$500M) and financial=20
advisory fee (approx C$1,500M), I think it is a good thing for Enron Canada=20
to manage. =20
