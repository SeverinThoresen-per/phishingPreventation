Jeff - This has been a textbook "nice guys finish last" experience for over=20
one year. The project is slipping away from us as is our reputation. We need=
=20
to devise an aggressive plan immediately to get those recalcitrants at PG&E=20
and their mouthpieces to understand that Enron means business.=20
Our record with the UC/CSU contract is already marginal, and by kowtowing to=
=20
those utility-types we will blow it altogether.

Unless I am missing a bigger picture issue, you need to tell me how we can=20
escalate this issue to the highest level at PG&E and the CPUC. I can't=20
imagine a $42 billion outfit being afraid of a bunch of wire and pipe guys.=20
As a former PG&E manager I know who was given attention and it wasn't the=20
meek. I am inclined to go with a recommendation by Jim Trudeau that we start=
=20
raising hell.=20
CSU Fresno is ready to escalate to Sacramento (read President Welty,=20
Chancellor Reed, Gov. Davis) upon our command. We need a parallel effort.=20
Tom Riley and I would like to discuss with you on Friday.=20

I have some ideas.  We should discuss.  But let's be clear on thing, there's=
=20
no single, silver bullet.  Please let me know when you'd like to discuss the=
=20
situation.  I think that if there was a case where we could break a log jam,=
=20
this one's it, due to the client's background, knowledge and savvy.  But it=20
will be nonetheless quite difficult.  I hope I didn't come on too strong on=20
the call yesterday--feedback's appreciated.  Andy, please call me when you=20
get a chance.  Best, Jeff
