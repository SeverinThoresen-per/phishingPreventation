That will work for me.  I assume you will be taking tomorrow off.  Good for

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for
dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends
at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How
does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound?=20

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take
Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her --
as I have given her the day off tomorrow.
