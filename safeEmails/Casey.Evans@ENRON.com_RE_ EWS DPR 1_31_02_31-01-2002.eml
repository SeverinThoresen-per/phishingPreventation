While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us re=
porting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  P=
lease email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to m=
y attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format u=
sed for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's. =20
=20
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to usi=
ng the spreadsheets.=20
