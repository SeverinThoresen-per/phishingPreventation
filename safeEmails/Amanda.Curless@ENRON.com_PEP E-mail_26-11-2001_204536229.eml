You may have received an e-mail from out PEP system asking you to provide fe=
edback on certain employees. Please disregard. This was sent in error and it=
 is not necessary at this time to complete the evaluations. These employees =
are on vacation and entered their reviewers into the system before they left=
=2E  Since then the business has decided to postpone the evaluation process =
and the opening of PEP. Please feel free to call me if you have any question=
s. Thanks!
