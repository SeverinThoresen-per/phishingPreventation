Alma- please make the appropriate meter station remarks for both Sept & Oct =
volume statements that the down time was confirmed by Tony Simpson in case G=
as Logistics calls and says otherwise----.Our volumes look good for both mon=
ths so far and we should not be changing anything.

Mike thanks for the info. We show a few hrs on the 4th starting @ 3 AM but t=
he majority begins around noon=20

Just heard from Jim Westbrook and he confirmed that our meter is OK - the pl=
ant was down for expansion so the 0's are good.   Should start seeing some v=
olumes with the gas day of the 4th.

Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy was convinced that they had been taking gas d=
uring this time.  Tony Simpson with Exol confirmed that they had not.

Will close the ticket.
