Sally,

After some phone calls today, I learned that I was deleted from the attendee=
 list for May 16 and 17.  However, they stretched and admitted me.  Because =
of the "late" entry, the process for soliciting feedback is different than o=
ther attendees.  I provided my list today, and as I understand it, they will=
 be sending the solicitation via E-mail to you.

Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Thanks for your feedback.

Brenda
