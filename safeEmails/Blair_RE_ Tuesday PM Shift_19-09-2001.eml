Just to let you know that everything ran smoothly with ID#2 for 9/18 and the=
 evening cycle for 9/19.  We had no problems with NBPL.

ANR's nom for 9/18 for Janesville was 107,917mmbtu and gas control asked the=
m for a little extra gas.  The flow rate was between 113,000 - 115,000mmbtu.

No problem either with printing the "scheduled volumes" report from business=
 objects for gas control.
