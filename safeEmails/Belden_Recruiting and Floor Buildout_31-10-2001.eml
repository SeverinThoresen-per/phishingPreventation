During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we =
are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor build =
out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concerns a=
bout adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing=
 unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these concerns =
and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures wi=
thout a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to talk to th=
eir manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing certain=
 things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college recruiting,=
 although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.  We have d=
ecided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a pr=
esence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading s=
chools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass an=
d had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are uncerta=
in about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best long ter=
m interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest. =
 We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most scho=
ols.  We have identified the best people from each school and have already m=
ade plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  The cost =
to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we ga=
in from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants =
in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it is a hard y=
ear to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our belief that stu=
dents would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment=
 may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to emphasize the point =
that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will interview people,=
 identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions based on the needs =
of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider the potential impac=
t that it could have on people in this office and Enron employees in other o=
ffices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we don't intend to hir=
e a bunch of new people if there are people within Enron who could fill posi=
tions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk.  We ma=
y end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the sta=
te of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we s=
till think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause for =
a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on t=
his.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying=
 would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final architect=
ural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more pre=
cisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives the build=
 out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move.  Final=
ly, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to=
 do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now.  While=
 we still think that we are going to move forward with this project, it seem=
s like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now. =
 In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budg=
et numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, or delay again.=
 =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, reli=
able information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard t=
ime for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up=
 the success of this office.
