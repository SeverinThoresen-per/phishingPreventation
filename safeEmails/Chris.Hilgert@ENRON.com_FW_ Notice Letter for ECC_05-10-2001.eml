Chris,
Wanted to let you know that the investment in Kachine/Gallup is $1,775,144.8=
5, not $1,742,855.41.  This will reduce the net gain to $324,158.15.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Karen

Karen,

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to =
sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we =
should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calcu=
lations below).  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I =
will deliver you the signed letter when I get it along with the detailed cal=
culations.

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and=
 make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup an=
d Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs=
 the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and=
 upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.=
  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes =
will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled thes=
e from the agreement.  Need to verify.
