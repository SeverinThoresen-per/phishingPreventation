Jim:
At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses=
=20
the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in=20
place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online=20
group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I=20
previously sent you, namely:

1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due=20
in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.

2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any=20
reference to omissions.

I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review=20
this.
