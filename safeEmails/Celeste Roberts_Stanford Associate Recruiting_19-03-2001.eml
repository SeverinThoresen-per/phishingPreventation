I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your=20
participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts=20
resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer. =20
Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will=20
receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to=20
congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up=20
with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information=
=2E

Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be=20
sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday,=20
March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who=20
did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:

"Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller=20
number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this=20
year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hire=
s=20
between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection=20
process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the=20
full-time associate program."

We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.

Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on=20
potential future Stanford recruiting events.

Celeste Roberts
