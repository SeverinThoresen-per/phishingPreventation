Louise,

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what=
 appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  T=
he DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would t=
his be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L r=
esponsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Contr=
olling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--a=
n I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

Regards,

Chip Schneider
