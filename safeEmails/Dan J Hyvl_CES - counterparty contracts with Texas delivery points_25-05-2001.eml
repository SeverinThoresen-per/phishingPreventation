I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as=20
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back=
=20
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with=20
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I=20
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no=20
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under=20
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and=
=20
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob=20
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the=20
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.
