David and Louise:
One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the=20
existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between th=
e=20
parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of=20
employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a=20
departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this?  Also, to the=20
extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you wan=
t=20
the approval process to be?
Carol
