Good morning.

David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment ag=
reements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept th=
ose agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to hand=
le agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all emplo=
yment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group,=
 name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under =
the agreement.

We will need those segregated as follows:

Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.
Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations.
EEL employees
Employees remaining in the Enron estate.

Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I woul=
d suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and =
then share it with the others.

Thanks!!

Michelle
