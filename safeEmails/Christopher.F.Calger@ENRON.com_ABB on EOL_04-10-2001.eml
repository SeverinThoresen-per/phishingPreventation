Chris,

I have received a number of emails.  Only one (CP&L) was asking specifically=
 about the turbines.  The other two (Calpine and NRG) are more interested in=
 the turbine call option concept as a risk management tool.

I will keep you posted on the contacts.  I placed a call back to CP&L, and e=
mail reply to Calpine.  NRG call is planned for the afternoon. =20

The turbine option is not clickable yet.  My citrix server is experiencing s=
ome problems.  The helpdesk is working on it.

Steve

Silence from Chino the last 2 days.  We were supposed to hear Tuesday am.
Marine Diesel is bringing a buyer to site tomorrow.  Supposedly they are rea=
dy to go for  a project overseas with a JV between HQ and probably the main =
utility in France.  They are ready with funds for the deposit.  Of course I'=
ve heard that before, but the broker is very excited so it may have some tru=
th.
Nevertheless,  I gather you're pressuring Steve to go click live on EOL.  I =
understand we need to move on this, and just pray no one is so foolhardy to =
click until we get these other buyers sorted out (unless it's a front run of=
 these potential buyers Chino and the French outfit).
Also, Tesco is back in the game with the California Power Authority and Wate=
r District - their timing is early next week.
