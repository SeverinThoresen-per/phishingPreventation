I have another project for Bill I'd like for you to work on while I'm in=20
Gillette.  Remember the deal with Dominion?  They let some saltwater get int=
o=20
our system and it cost boo-coos of money to fix and we are recouping those=20
monies from their gas contract?  Well, there hasn't been any production at=20
that meter for about 6 months and so there is nothing to offset against.  I'=
m=20
leaving in your chair Gerald Lofton's schedule of monies still owed. =20

Would you get Bill up to speed on the facts (I think you still may have the=20
file) and have him draft a demand letter for the balance of the monies owed?

Thanks.
