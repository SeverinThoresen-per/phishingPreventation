Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.

I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

Ellen Dailey
