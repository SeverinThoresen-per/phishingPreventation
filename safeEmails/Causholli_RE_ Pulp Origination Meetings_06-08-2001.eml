Dear Team,

In the next couple of weeks, I will be scheduling meetings with the individu=
al pulp originators.  We are gathering information on the pulp business and =
the originators' individual strategies when prospecting and maintaining clie=
nt relationships. =20

To prepare for these meetings, I would like to develop an outline of questio=
ns that we would like to discuss with the originators.  I hope to get their =
views on the industry, problems, and success stories.

I will scheduling a meeting later this week to discuss the strategies for th=
ese meetings.  In the meantime, would you put down topics or questions that =
you would like to discuss?  If you have any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,

Stacey=20
