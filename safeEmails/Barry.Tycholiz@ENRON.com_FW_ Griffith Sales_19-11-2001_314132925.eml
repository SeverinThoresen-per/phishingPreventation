Kim, please schedule the appropriate people for a 15 minute discussion. I am=
 sure that this can be resolved.  Also, be prepared to discuss the "Penaltie=
s" component of our obligations to put this in perspective.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need y=
our input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the fre=
quency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walk=
ing away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow=
 in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect=
 a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of u=
pstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliverie=
s to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, th=
e reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which=
 as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contr=
act for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respon=
d to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to=
 insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issue=
s into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated. =20
