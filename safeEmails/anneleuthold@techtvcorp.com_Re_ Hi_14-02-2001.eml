did you go and sign up on that website?  there are a lot of people from our
class on there.  what is going on?  how is san francisco?  can you pay your
gas bill.  i trade energy in that area.  how is the nightlife?  are you
dating at all?  life here is hectic.  i have just been working and going
out.  when are you going home again?  i don't know when i will get back
there, but i wish i was going back to ski.  shoot me an email when you get
a chance.
