Evidently, we need to get Mike and James' consent to send someone over to=20
London....  Clara was over there working on rate & currency which has nothin=
g=20
to do with London.

I am starting to hear more and more noise about James' attitude.  It is=20
getting to the point (and possibly is already) that no one wants to work wit=
h=20
him and it could isolate London operations even further from the mainstream.=
 =20
It may be time for someone to have a heart-to-heart with him (Fernley?).

James,
Clara was there to work with Shane on some items for the London Rate &=20
Currency desk.  Clara was also working with the IT person we have in London=20
who is  working to improve the processes of how curves are loaded as well as=
=20
how cash flows are received. =20
In the prior weeks when Shane and I met with some of the groups, I had told=20
them that Clara would be over to follow-up on some of the items. =20

Sheila,

I am disappointed to say that neither Mike or I were knowingly told of=20
Clara's visit and she didn't introduce herself or explain what she was doing=
=20
to either of us. She also arrived at a time when Michael Kass was on holiday=
=2E=20
As a result of this I am concerned about the success of her trip and some of=
=20
the conclusions she may have drawn.

I would therefore appreciate it if you could arrange for a summary of the=20
purpose, results and conclusions that followed her week's work so that we ca=
n=20
all understand what the future holds.


Thanks James
