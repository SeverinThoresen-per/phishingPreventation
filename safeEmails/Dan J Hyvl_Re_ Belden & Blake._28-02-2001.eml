If the deal is to be a fixed volume, I would prefer to use the Enfolio Maste=
r=20
Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement and document the deal thereunder.  Please let m=
e=20
know.

Russell, Have you sent me a credit sheet on this?

John!

We are ok with the structure of the deal as discussed ( Purchase 4000 @ day=20
MichCon @ NYMEX + 0.21(0.20) with an option to fix the price -  APR - OCT). =
=20
However we would like to have this done under a contract.=20

Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or =
a=20
"Master Purchase, Sale". =20


Thanks
Rudwell.=20
