Good evening, everyone.  Mike Peterson, who many of you have met and who is =
working with J.C. on your case, asked me to send the following e-mail to you=
:

The lawyers for Amalgamated Bank filed an amended class action complaint yes=
terday. Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the =
original one (our comparison was "line by line" but not "word for word"), it=
 appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief a=
t the very end of the complaint - namely, "to order an accounting of insider=
-trading proceeds," "disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds," "restitution=
 of investors' monies of which they were defrauded," and "as to the section =
11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages." These=
 additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to=
 preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended compl=
aint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or a=
sserted causes of action. If you nonetheless would like your own copy of the=
 amended complaint (all 78 pages), just let me know and I will send it to yo=
u.



This e-mail and any attached files may be confidential and subject to attorn=
ey/client privilege. If you received it in error, please immediately notify =
the sender by return e-mail or by calling (713)654-7600.=20
