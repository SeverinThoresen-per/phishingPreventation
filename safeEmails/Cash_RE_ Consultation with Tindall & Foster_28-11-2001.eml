Subject:	Consultation with Tindall & Foster

Michelle:  I would like to recommend that when the H.R. Representative has a=
n exit interview with a foreign national employee who is being laid off from=
 Enron, that Enron offer them a consultation with Tindall & Foster.  This wo=
uld enable the individual to talk to the attorneys about their individual im=
migration status and concerns, after they leave Enron's employment.  I belie=
ve it would also show that we are concerned about them.

The approximate cost of this is $150 per hour.

Do you see any problems with this?
Please advise
Margaret
