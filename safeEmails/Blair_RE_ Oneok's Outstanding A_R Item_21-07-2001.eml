Lynn, I have been trying for several months now to get Onoek to reimburse No=
rthern for a credit they have taken twice (5/00 and 6/00 Commodity billing).

Northern wired Oneok $178,748.87 on 8/10/00 after netting 6/00 commodity ite=
ms.  On 2/12/01 Oneok came back an took a credit for the same items.  Two it=
ems were short paid which now leaves Oneok owing Northern $182,006.19.

Nothern also wired Oneok $26,847.80 on 6/29/00 after netting a transport imb=
alance with other outstanding items.  Oneok has taken this credit twice as w=
ell.

I have tried on numerous occasion to get Oneok to reimburse Northern but, On=
eok continues to tell me they are researching the problem and can't seem to =
locate the wires.  When I spoke with Oneok early on they found the larger wi=
re which was posted as Enron instead of Northern.  Again today they are tell=
ing me they can not locate the payment.  The reason for this memo is to get =
you assist me in getting these items cleared.  I have been working with Rich=
ard Tibbs (accounting) and Kelly Olsteen (payment), Richard reports to Randy=
 McIntosh.  I really appreciate your assistance.
