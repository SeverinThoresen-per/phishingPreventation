We are planning to have the fantasy draft on Wednesday at 7:30 (or whenever =
Kris yells out "Let's Do This") at my apartment (Archstone Memorial Heights =
#2017).  The website is established and you can check it out and change your=
 information (link at bottom).  Use this link to establish a username and id=
, then you can logon on from nfl.com and choosing fantasy.  Members have exp=
ressed an interest in learning their draft position before draft day, so we =
are planning on drawing for draft placement at 8:00 tonite at my apt. or at =
10:00 tonite at the Marquee (depending on your response).  You do not need t=
o be present, but are invited to either attend or participate via phone, int=
ernet.  Draft night will be BYOB, and when ya'll see the caliber team that I=
 will be fielding, you will want to drink heavily.  The $50 league fee is du=
e by the start of Week 3, penalizable with a loss untill it is paid.  To ent=
ice early payment, a 10% discount will be offered to anyone who pays on draf=
t night.  Email or call me with any questions/concerns/advice about the leag=
ue.
