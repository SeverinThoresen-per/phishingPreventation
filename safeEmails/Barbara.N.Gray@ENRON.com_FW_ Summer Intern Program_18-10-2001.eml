I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in t=
he Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-y=
ear law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the student=
s at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resume=
s.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for revi=
ew.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.  =

Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring prog=
rams.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students=
=2E  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensat=
ion.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has prov=
ided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If =
your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or =
if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreci=
ate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this =
 e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)
