Cooper -

I thought that you might be interested in an update to our web server activi=
ties...

Our plan (at this point) is to purchase a new production server and keep the=
 existing system as the development server and file server.

This is what we are looking at:
http://www.directpluspro.compaq.com/printconfig.asp?oi=3DE9CED&dcpqsid=3D1DM=
LAVWF98S92G2N00AKHB60TV7UA5HF&BEID=3D19701

We are planning to purchase two of these (identical of course). We plan to h=
ave one mirror the other so the we can balance the load, and also so that (i=
n the event of a problem) one can function independent of the other... the i=
dea the we can literally shut one down without the web site going down is ex=
citing... also, being able to upgrade by simply slapping in a new "pizza box=
" is quite intriguing...

Any comments that you might have are more than welcome.

Bob
