We have just obtained from the court the citation that we need to serve on M=
SN.  We now have to take it to Austin to serve on MSN's registered agent.  B=
ecause of the time of day, we will not be able to do it today.  I have instr=
ucted the process server to go to Austin and serve it first thing in the mor=
ning.  Once that happens, I will let you know and we can give MSN a call.  U=
ntil then, no mention of the lawsuit.

As I said before, as negotiations proceed, please let me know if any commerc=
ial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.


Andy
