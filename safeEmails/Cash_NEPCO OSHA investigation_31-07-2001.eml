Hi, David!

I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.

I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in=
 Houston.  Specifically, an employee named Jason Davis claims that he was fi=
red from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions the=
re.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an i=
nvestigation.

Have you heard of this?  How would you like to handle it?

We can discuss in more detail on Thursday.

Michelle
