Subject:	Emergency Contact Procedures
Importance:	High

Per Rick Buy's request, we are developing procedures so that the head of eac=
h RAC department will have a current list of emergency contact numbers for a=
ll RAC employees.  I have outlined the plan below:

The Assistant in each group will be responsible for updating home telephone =
numbers, cellular phone numbers and home addresses for each member of their =
group.  Rita Hennessy will consolidate the list for all of RAC on a monthly =
basis.
The monthly update will be emailed to the personal email address of each dep=
artment head or their designee.  This update should be stored on a personal =
computer until the next monthly update is received.
Two hard-copies of the monthly update will be maintained in a file at the ho=
me of Rick Carson and at the home of Sharon Sullo.

If this plan is acceptable to you, please let me know the personal email add=
ress to use.  Please call me with comments or questions.

Thanks,

Sharon=20
