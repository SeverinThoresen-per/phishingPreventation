Where do you stand on Broker Client?  As you can see below, some of the Euro=
pean desks are supportive of getting deals done, but I am leery of continuin=
g Broker Client roll-out if there remains a chance that we will pull back fr=
om this offering in the near future.  Also, I ran into Presto and he said he=
 hadn't yet spoken to you about his issues with the product.  Let me know wh=
at your position is and we'll go from there.

Thanks,
Brad

Brad,
It looks like I have taken back control of the TFS Europe deal.  I have rece=
ived confirmation from each of the different desks that this is something th=
ey are willing to pursue.  I went back to Alan Kurzer (president of TFS) wit=
h 300,000 Euros (about $265k USD) for Continental Power, UK power and Int'l.=
 Coal.  He didn't bite so I told him to show me a bid.  I'll let you know ho=
w it goes.  I've got a call into Mark Greenberg about the contractual issues=
=2E  It should be something we can address in the amendment.

-Dan
