>"So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say,

>Seoul."

>Last Thursday, when Chung's e-mail found its way back to headquarters, the

>Chung's former colleagues remained puzzled yesterday by his message. A
>Carlyle source told Johnson: "He'd only been here five days. Ask Merrill
>Lynch if he did anything like this."
