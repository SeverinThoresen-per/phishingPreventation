Any weather deals that you see that have WS and then a two-digit number need=
=20
to be sent back to have our number written on them.  They should be returned=
=20
to Celeste Cisneros.  I am not sure where she is located, but if you happen=20
to find any of these, just ask and whoever does the run will make sure they=20
go to the proper location.

Thank you!
Brenna
