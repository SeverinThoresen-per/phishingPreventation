		In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101=
073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and inste=
ad use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the G=
as Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could=
 you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 mo=
nths?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Dai=
ly Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this w=
ill give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiat=
e the 2 contracts.=20
