How about "The Deal Might Not Happen LLC". In a call yesterday, Northwestern=
=20
proposed changing the economic terms significantly, which would reduce our=20
gross margin by more than half. We are awaiting a written proposal.

It probably makes sense to go ahead anyway with the formation of the LLC,=20
because we'll eventually need it even if this particular deal does not close=
=2E=20
How about Merchant Energy Ventures, L.L.C. ?

Let's catch up tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben

We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.  Any suggestions?
