Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained=20
to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose=20
commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far=
=20
as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential=20
information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron i=
s=20
the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term "Even=

of Default" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With=20
respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is=20
okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since=

I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For=20

the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on=20
this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.

 An Enron entity will be Calculation Agent.  Do you have concerns
about Sections 2(c) and 7?  The latest draft is the June 9 draft, but we are
still commenting on it.

Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent
would
be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that
Enron
Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking
at a
June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in
Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.
