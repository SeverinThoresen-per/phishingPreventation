Rick,

Nice kudos from Robert.

Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.  As you may recall, =
she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the gener=
alists.  They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doin=
g is essential.

Thanks.

Michelle
