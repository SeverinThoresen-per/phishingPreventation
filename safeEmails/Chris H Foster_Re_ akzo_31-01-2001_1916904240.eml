I agree with the way you wnat to change the deal in the system (i.e. making=20
the 1125 MMBtu * # of days/month the first gas through the meter on a monthl=
y=20
basis rather than a daily basis) is the correct way to do it.  That is what=20
the client expects and it will be difficult to get money out of them based o=
n=20
the other way.  Kim might want to contact the client if she wants to use the=
=20
daily approach for future business.

Chris,
I am back to this issue.  I have been told that the way we can fix the a/r=20
issues is to change the way the deal is entered in sitara.  I wanted to make=
=20
sure you agree with the change.  The way the deal is entered now is=20
1,125 daily  and the rest at the NGI index.
The days that Akzo takes less than the 1,125 the volumes allocation changes.=
 =20
Making the system want to charge them more since it adds more volumes to the=
=20
NGI price.

I was wondering if we can change the deal to:
1,125 * #of days in month @ $2.6676
remaning volume  @ $NGI index.
This way it reflex the way ENA has invoice Akzo(since Akzo takes the require=
=20
1,125 on a monthly basis.

Please e-mail me back letting me know if this change agrees with how you=20
wanted Akzo to be invoice and that will reflex how Akzo has been invoice.
thanks

Good morning Chris,
I have a question on Akzo's invoicing.  Since we invoice Akzo manually I am=20
trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.
The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbt=
u=20
daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they=20
take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may=20
have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to=20
speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:

August manual invoice:
34,875 @ 2.6676 =3D  $93,032.55
24,520 @ 4.4775 =3D  $109,790.09
Total        $202,822.64


System Invoice:
34,633  @  2.6676  =3D $92,386.99
24,762  @   4.4775=3D   $110,871.86
Total          $203,258.85

Difference         $436.21
The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed.=20

The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite.=20
My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???
Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.
thanks
isabel
