No, you are correct. In my haste to get something out to everyone I misstate=
d the concensus of the group. Storage allocations will be the final process =
in the Timely cycle only.
Thanks for clarifying the point.

We understood that the allocation would be the final process only for the Ti=
mely cycle. =20
Did we misunderstand?

Thanks.

To summarize the outcome of the meeting this morning....
In the short term:
Storage allocations will continue to be the final process performed during t=
he Timely and Evening cycles
Storage allocations will be before the Confirmation process for the Non-Grid=
, IntraDay1 and IntraDay 2 cycles / SBS will not be available during the Con=
firmation process for these cycles=20
The changes will be made effective for the gad day of July 6th

For the longer term
Continue the above=20
Make modifications to the storage allocatons program to allow SBS availabili=
ty for storage activity which is the opposite to the activity being allocate=
d (i.e., SBS storage withdrawals when storage injections are being allocated=
)
