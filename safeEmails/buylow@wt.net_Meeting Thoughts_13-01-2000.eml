I'm sitting here a bit disappointed and pissed.

Do you and Pat honestly believe it is "one man's word against another" on=20
setting up the link builder by the 12th of the month?

If so, why have I been saying something is wrong with some of the links for=20
the last several days? And why did I work so late the first couple of days o=
f=20
each month setting up the links when I had so much time?

I'm not going to play this game with Mr. Lloyd. When he took the time to sho=
w=20
up he was coached well in what was needed to be done, how to do it, and when=
=20
to do it.

This situation was entirely predictable. It is always "I'm about to do it"=20
and it is always an "I thought you said............." situation.

You know better. I won't be hung out again.
