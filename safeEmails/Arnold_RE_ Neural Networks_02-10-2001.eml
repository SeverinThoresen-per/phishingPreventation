not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  jus=
t for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for f=
ront month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a mont=
h 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ =
month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to creat=
e a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month =
2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical b=
ut very easy for a human to add bias. =20

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject sy=
stem to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to auto=
mate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few pow=
er point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning sy=
stems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including =
actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve build=
ing functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with you=
r own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to =
do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the neces=
sary predictive power. =20
