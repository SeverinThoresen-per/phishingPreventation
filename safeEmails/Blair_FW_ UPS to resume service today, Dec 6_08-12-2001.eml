Rick and Lynn,

Raetta and I heard from the mailroom early this afternoon that UPS was suspe=
nding service with Enron.  We discussed other options and decided to inquire=
 with UPS or Fed Ex about opening an account thru NNG.

When I contacted UPS, I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron t=
oday.  The mailroom is aware of the situation.

Larry
