FYI - We don't have any active contracts behind this meter.  There was a=20

6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and=20
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have=20
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in=20
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on=
=20
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8=20
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow=20
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf. =20
The meter is now out of service.

Any questions - you know where to find me.
