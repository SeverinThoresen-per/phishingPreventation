Carol and Chris,
I'm not sure Sharon knows what she is doing.  If we accept her blacklined=20
changes, it seems to me we go back to the original EEI language about=20
penalties which we like.  Perhaps we should just try this. The drafting=20
technique she wants to use does not get her where she thinks it does.

If and when her attorney reads this thing, the issue will be:  do we remain=20
silent about penalties, or do we go into more detail?  We want to go into=20
more detail if they cannot accept the standard language.=20

Our choice seems to be:  1. Tell her we accept her change and sign the cover=
=20
sheet and try to blow it by them, or 2. open the can of worms of more detail=
=20
and get it over with.   Let's discuss this.   ----cgy=20

Chris, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it=20
could expedite the approval process.  I have attached the language we propos=
e=20
which basically deletes the specific language regarding penalty for=20
replacement and sale prices (see section 1.a (1) and (2)in the attached).  I=
=20
wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the=20
other one. THX

Sharon:=20

As indicated by my previous e-mail to you, since Shari Stack has left=20
Enron, it will take me a couple days to resurrect this EEI.  Later today it=20
is likely I will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we=20
sent.  Subsequently, I will get you a clear statement as to alternative=20
language that leaves the Replacement Cost definition less clear ala WSPP.=20

Thanks=20
