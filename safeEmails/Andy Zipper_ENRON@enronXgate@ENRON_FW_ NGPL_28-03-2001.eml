Julie,

We didn't get to finish our conversation in the elevator re:NGPL.

Do we expect them to repsond to us. If they think the price is too high then=
 we can start negotiating. If they think any price is too high then we have =
a problem. Given that you have a relationship with the person in charge ther=
e, getting a response from them will really help us figure out whether this =
is going to fly or not.

Thanks,
AZ
