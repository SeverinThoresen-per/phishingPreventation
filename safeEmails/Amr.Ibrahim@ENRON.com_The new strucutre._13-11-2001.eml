Rick:

I hope that I am not exceeding my authority from Risk Analytics perspective =
by seeking your permission to comment on the suggested new structure of the =
Department.  If you think that this is not necessary at this stage, I would =
like to communicate the following points:

The concern of risk analytics is to ensure the following:
1.	The different business activities, and the different regions are well ide=
ntified and covered, yet not isolated from each other to negatively impact s=
ynergy. =20
2.	The suggested structure clearly identifies lines of responsibility, and a=
ccountability.
3.	The above lines of responsibility, and accountability, pass through your =
primary support direct system (i.e., Jim Steffes); this is at least as far a=
s the "regulatory-intensive" functions.   =20
4.	Ensure that support functions (e.g. database management, regulatory resea=
rch) are well connected to the different components of the Department.

I am confident that you had addressed these issues, however, and  to stop be=
ating around the bush, I  just want to discuss further point 3 above for its=
 relative importance in the coming period. =20

I look forward for any question or comment
