I was somewhat disturbed by Robin's email below and unclear as to why Meliss=
a Becker needed to know how NEPCO participated in the PRC process.  I would =
like to discuss this with you as soon as you return from your trip.  I reali=
ze NEPCO is a little different.  However, Robin and the rest of the NEPCO te=
am need to understand that as long as they are part of Enron, they will, in =
some form or fashion, participate in the current performance management proc=
ess.  Robin needs to discontinue using the term "forced" and begin using the=
 term "preferred".  Also, please explain to Robin that in the overall EEOS P=
RC meeting held in Houston, in which both John Gillis and Dan Haas participa=
ted as voting committee members,  the Enron-wide preferred distribution proc=
ess was adhered to.  I would like to clear up this confusion as soon as poss=
ible. =20

Thanks,

Hi Melissa:=20

Sorry for the late response.  NEPCO did not participate in the preferred=20
distribution for PRC.  The only group that I am aware of within NEPCO that=20
was "forced" to recognize it was the HR department and we are still=20
discussing the outcome of that exercise and forced ratings.  Let me know if=20
you have any other questions!=20

THANKS!=20

Hi Robin.  Hope all is going well in Bothell.  I have a quick question=20
about PRC ( the performance review process we use in Houston).  Does=20
NEPCO use the same process of 360 feedback, followed by assigning=20
employee ratings based on a preferred distribution, followed by=20
communication with the employee?  I heard that some parts of NEPCO use=20
it and some don't.  Could you give me the "lowdown?"  Thanks!=20
