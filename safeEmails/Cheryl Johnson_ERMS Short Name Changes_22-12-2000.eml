FYI...

Kate, I believe you asked that short name changes not be done before 7:a. =20
Whether that's your time or my time, I know I won't be doing them at that=20
time.  :-)  It will more likely be around 10:a CST, and then I will send=20
notification to Jeremy, Sanjeev and Oscar.  Just know that every Friday,=20
short name changes will be made.   Give me a call if you have any concerns.

Happy Holidays!

Subject: ERMS Short Name Changes

Dear All,

This note is to summarise our meeting today regarding the timing and=20
notification of changes to ERMS short names in GCP and ERMS.=20

Timing
As discussed, the Credit Aggregation System requires that short names are in=
=20
sync in GCP and ERMS.  As a result, we agreed to change ERMS short names in=20
both systems every Friday morning and only at that time.

Notification
Notification of the need to change a short name in ERMS currently comes to=20
ERMS IT from a variety of sources.  It was agreed that an effort would be=20
made by GCP to centralise all requests in the formal Name Changes & Mergers=20
Report.  Sanjeev/Oscar are to aid this effort by forwarding to Cheryl Johnso=
n=20
the names of people who currently bypass the Report and contact ERMS IT=20
directly.

Please let me know if there are any comments on or additions to this summary=
=2E

Thanks, and happy holidays!

Kathryn
