The files that were given to me have been reassigned within the group.  I re=
solved Morgan Stanley Cap Group and sent a signed global confirmation accept=
ance  to Todd D.  As to EES, I was working with Sarah Dietrich, attorney wit=
h EES, but could never get them to execute since officers would not do so on=
 the basis of the internal "reorg" issues.  Sarah was going to continue to w=
ork on this.
