Anne and I talked  with Neil Imus (our V&E HSR lawyer) after our meeting thi=
s afternoon.  We relayed to him the substance of our discussions.  He reiter=
ated his earlier position that there is "no harm" is requesting a shorter ex=
tension in a non-offensive fashion.   He had talked with one of AEP's lawyer=
s earlier and AEP is considering requesting a meeting with Jade to discuss o=
ur need for a June 1 closing. We also believe that this would a good approac=
h; however, the three of us concurred that timing is more important than the=
 method of communication and that if a meeting cannot be arranged in the nex=
t day or two, we should go ahead and present our request over the phone, wit=
h a letter to follow perhaps.  We attempted to reconnect with AEP's lawyers =
but were unsuccessful.  We will continue to try to press AEP for a decision =
on how to proceed. =20

Please call me or Anne if you have any questions.  We will keep you posted.
