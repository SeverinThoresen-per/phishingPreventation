As a follow up to our meeting last week with Colleen on the Ardmore facility=
, I had a conversation this morningwith Richard Sanders concerning the statu=
s of the settlement negotiations with Dynegy concerning Northern Natural Gas=
=2E I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreeme=
nt that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a=
 data center.=20

I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to=
 provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NE=
TCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center. 	The lease also needs to=
 make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron's=
 control.

Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enro=
n developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covere=
d software to provide services to third parties such as AEP, Bridgeline and =
Northern Natural Gas.	If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.			=
