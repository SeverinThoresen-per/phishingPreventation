Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was gr=
eat.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct=
 reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that thi=
s wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover=
 to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for =
upcoming articles. =20

Sounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.  This second six w=
eeks is proving to be a little more challenging for Amanda - or her effort m=
ay have gotten diverted! =20

I am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calen=
dar.  --Sally =20

I was at Kleb yesterday and found Amanda on the All A's Honor Roll; the appl=
e didn't fall far from the tree!  I found my son on the All A's and one or t=
wo B's honor roll.  Did you see your article in Enron Net Works News (ENN)? =
 Have you received any comments?  Tom Gros read it and enjoyed it.  The webt=
rends reports indicate strong readership on the piece!  Look for the continu=
ing series on Energy Operations in upcoming issues at http://enn.enron.com
