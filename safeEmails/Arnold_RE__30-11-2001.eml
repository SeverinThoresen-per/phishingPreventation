Although I love you, that's not appropriate for any 3 way sleeves.  EFS shou=

Along the lines of our conversation a few weeks back...we don't want to take=
 advantage of the situation Enron is in.  By default you were billed on the =
sell side of each transaction.  If that is not appropriate please let me kno=
w and we will zero out the commission.
