Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let =
the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are beh=
ind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper=
 vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity. =20

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our i=
ssues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down t=
heir exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.=20
