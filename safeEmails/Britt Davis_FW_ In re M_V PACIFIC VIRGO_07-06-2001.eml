       David,

       Please be advised that Underwriters' adjuster has agreed that our=20
chemist may meet with theirs.  Please so advise Steve Jones, provide him wit=
h=20
a copy of Underwriters' response to our claim, and have him meet with=20
Underwriters' adjuster as soon as possible.

 (Jim, thanks for getting this set up with Underwriters' adjuster so quickly=
).

       Many thanks.

       Britt

 Jim,

 This will confirm our telephone conference about this matter, in light of=20
Underwriters' recent response to our claim.  You will ask Underwriters'=20
adjuster for permission for our chemist to speak directly with their chemist=
=20
immediately about the facts.  You will also ask for a meeting to be set up=20
for you, our broker, and Underwriters' adjuster to see whether Underwriters=20
mean to take a hard line on our claim.

 Interestingly, Underwriters' position seems to be, at least preliminarily,=20
and subject to further comment by their chemists, that nothing was wrong wit=
h=20
our cargo or the ship; the cargo was simply misdescribed as turbine=20
fuel-grade condensate by SGS due to flawed testing by SGS at loadport, when=20
it was in fact nothing better than crude. Meanwhile, we all noted that=20
Underwriters' adjuster included the following statement in her report:  "It=20
has not been demonstrated that the oil suffered from inherent vice."  I am=20
both pleased and surprised that this was included in Underwriters' report,=20
and share David's feeling that the adjuster probably inadvertantly copied=20
this from a confidential report from her chemist.  If we can successfully=20
hammer at Underwriters' preliminary theory, Underwriters will find it more=20
difficult to fall back on an inherent vice defense.

 I await further word from you.  Many thanks for your help.

 Britt
