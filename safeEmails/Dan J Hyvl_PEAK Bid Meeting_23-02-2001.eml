These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not=
=20
attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will nee=
d=20
to work on modifications to the Contract language.


1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is=
=20
first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice,=20
then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.

2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial=20
bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company=
=20
shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of=20
prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of=20
prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty. =20

3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures=20
Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer=20
needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an "eligible contract=
=20
participant" under the Act.

4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the=20
opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such=20
opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the=20
Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out=20
for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to=20
complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?

5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice=20
of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early=20
Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should hav=
e=20
the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet. =
=20
Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.

6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consisten=
t=20
so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is=20
made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not=
=20
made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to=20
pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer fo=
r=20
any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or=20
aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.
