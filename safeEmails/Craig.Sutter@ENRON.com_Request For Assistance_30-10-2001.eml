Mr. Lay:

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relati=
onship EES has with Sysco Corporation. =20

EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with o=
ne another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered i=
nto a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California faci=
lities.  We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco;=
 an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side=
 management contract for all of their facilities.

We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today.  However, in a p=
hone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, T=
erry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed M=
r. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us "until Enron's =
financial picture clears up".  Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns=
 about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executi=
ve at Enron.=20

Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Dir=
ectors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros=
 and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition.  Mr. Cot=
ros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st.  His direct phone num=
ber is (281) 584-1415.  His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number=
 is (281) 584-1405.   Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:  =20

Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985.  Mr=
=2E Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief =
Executive Officer since January 2000.  He served as Chief Operating Officer =
from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000.  He=
 has been employed by SYSCO since 1974.  Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Execu=
tive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee.   Source: P=
roxy, 9/24/01

Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance.  Oth=
erwise, please let me know if you will not be able take the action requested=
 and I will initiate an alternative plan.

Respectfully,

Craig Sutter
