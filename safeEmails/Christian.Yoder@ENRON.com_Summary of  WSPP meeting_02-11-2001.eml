Listening in by phone is so much better than traveling to these meetings.  I=
t greatly reduces one's exposure to the toxins of this process.=20

1. A learned expert on Secured Transactions  from Mike's firm gave an openin=
g address on the principles of granting and receiving the grantation of secu=
rity interests.  Almost completely irrelevant. The guy up and suggested that=
 for a given transaction, the parties might consider giving a security inter=
est in an office building, ie.real estate,  as collateral.

2. A cannabalized EEI Credit Support Annex  was tabled by Deedee Russo of Re=
liant and muddled through.  The format was typically: =20
   Mike:  "Okay guys, why don't you explain to me what you want." =20
   Member:  "We think we need this...blah blah blah, "
   Mike:  "Okay, we'll put that into our next draft and have a conference ca=
ll in December and a meeting in   January and remember, none of this is bind=
ing, its all optional."=20

3.  At the very end, a lawyer from PacifiCorp managed to raise the vital iss=
ue and Mike got his hackles up very quickly.  The PacifiCorp guy was basical=
ly saying that the WSPP was becoming more and more like the EEI and that thi=
s made it more and more difficult for parties to decide which agreement to u=
se.  His implication was that the WSPP should try to remain different or thr=
ow in the towel and be just like the EEI.  Small reacted from a position of =
religion, dogmatically and loudly asserting that the two agreements were fun=
damentally different.   Here is where he left himself open to the shining li=
ght of rational analysis:  if someone, had the time,  and we thought it matt=
ered enough, the approach to take would be this: =20

Dispassionate Spokesperson:  A question has been raised:  is the WSPP agreem=
ent becoming more or less like the EEI?  To fairly answer this question one =
needs to look at all the changes that have been made by  the WSPP in the las=
t three years, comparing each change to the EEI agreement.   (prepare compar=
ison document).  If we look at the evidence do we see convergence or diverge=
nce?  The answer will be overwhelmingly convergence.  If this objective stud=
y could be placed before the "Membership" it would speak for itself.  Nobody=
 would have to utter a word.  The comparison document would do the job.  If =
we are going to bother playing with these guys, this is what we should do. I=
t would take some time, but if we circulated it to the membership and then m=
erely raised the question of future direction, we might deal this tedious pr=
ocess a mortal blow.=20

 Believe it or not, the solution to  this process is to follow the same proc=
ess that went on when the King James Bible was put together in 1611.  Variou=
s scholars took various views on how various Hebrew passages should be trans=
lated, and it took a committee of draftsmen, appointed and sent to Geneva  b=
y King James  to pound out the form that has stood the test of time for cent=
uries. The Joint Drafting Committee's time on the historical stage is finall=
y arriving.  I am going to talk to this Pacificorp fellow and Brenda Anderso=
n at BPA and see what happens.     ----cgy=20
