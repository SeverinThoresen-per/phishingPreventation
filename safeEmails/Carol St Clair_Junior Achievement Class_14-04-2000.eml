school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done=20
and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something=20
akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for=20
this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to=

ask.  My extension is 33989.
