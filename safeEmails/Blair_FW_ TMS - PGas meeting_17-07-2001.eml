A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk=
 about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation=
 Summary.
=20
Issue:
=20
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag f=
or the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process curre=
nt gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the i=
ncomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacti=
ng the imbalance calculation.
=20
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current=
 day volumes=20
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
=20
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) =
volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract =
identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will mod=
ify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes inclu=
ded in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
=20
Blank     =3D Complete record
I             =3D Incomplete record
*             =3D Complete but edited record
=20
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have a=
ny question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you
