To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading =
activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its offici=
al Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities=
 Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two major deve=
lopments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the Unit=
ed Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process,=
 the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of th=
e "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familia=
r with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised P=
olicies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new=
 intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Departmen=
t. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:

If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures du=
ring the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although =
you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Pol=
icies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies=
 and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within tw=
o weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you=
 to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP P=
ersonal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Proc=
edures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extensio=
