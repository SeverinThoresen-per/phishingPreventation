I got a voice-mail from Dean Vanek, Scottsborough's general counsel, just a=20
moment ago.  He has just come off a road trip and had a chance to read my=20
telefax.  Vanek will apparently send me some of the documentation I=20
requested, although it is not clear that he will send me the documents that=20
reflect that all the loads for which Scottsborough is being sued were in fac=
t=20
purchased from MG Metals.

My last question on my telefax to Vanek was what attorney Vanek would=20
typically retain in a lawsuit such as this to defend Scottsborough.  Vanek=20
said in his voice-mail that in this suit, he does not intend to hire an=20
attorney.  Vanek said he would pay whatever the carrier was suing for, then=20
deduct that amount from whatever Scottsborough owes us for aluminum.  Then,=20
contradicting himself, Vanek said that he would join MG Metals as a party=20
(which would of course require him to retain an attorney).  I assume that he=
=20
probably could join us as a party on a breach of contract theory, given that=
=20
Scottsborough purchased the metal from us "freight prepaid".   I'm not sure=20
that an Alabama court has personal jurisdiction over Enron Metals sufficient=
=20
to allow joinder, but it might.

Vanek also seemed irritated at the time MG Metals had taken to reply to his=20
earlier communications, and directed me to our Montreal office if I wanted=20
copies of things he had previously sent to us.  Of course, we all decided=20
some time ago to take a "let sleeping dogs lie" strategy in hopes that a=20
carrier like Alabama wouldn't actually file suit.  In any case, I don't know=
=20
how much of this apparent irritation is real or is strategy.

I called Vanek back and again missed him, but left a voice-mail to the effec=
t=20
that I read his message "loud and clear" and would jump on reviewing the=20
exhibits he was sending me as soon as I received them.  I told him that I wa=
s=20
particularly interested in them because if the bs/l were marked "freight=20
prepaid", then Scottsborough may have a good defense to the carrier's case.

As you may recall, ICTS has been joined as a party to this action.  ICTS is=20
the party that didn't pay the carrier.  I try to call ICTS and see what it=20
intends to do in this matter.  =20
