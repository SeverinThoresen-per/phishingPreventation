Subject: EOL killed deals

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of=20
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your=20
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a=20
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we=20
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark=
=20
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a=20
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We=20
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to=
=20
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824),=20
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746).=20

Call me if you have any questions.
