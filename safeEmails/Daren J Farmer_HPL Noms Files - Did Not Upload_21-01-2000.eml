Subject: HPL Noms Files - Did Not Upload

So sorry....

I do not know who exactly to send this email to....

I do not know whose HPL nom files these are.  Whoever was trying to send nom=
s=20
to HPL between 4:16pm and 5pm on Thursday 1/20/2000, your noms did not get=20
uploaded into POPS.  Please re-send if you have not already.

The production unix machine we process the edi noms on ran out of space. =20
When the machine runs out of space, it pages me, but unfortunately no data=20
can be saved in the edi files.

I was trying to free up space and after I was done (like 1 hour later, ie.=20
6pm), did I notice that these nom files had zero data in them.  Because they=
=20
have zero data in them, I do not know what gas dates or contracts were=20
suppose to be in the file which is why I do not know if these are ECT, HPLR,=
=20
HPLC.

We are suppose to get a bigger unix box installed the weekend of 2/5/2000. =20
This running our of space has only happened twice in the past year that I=20
remember and that it affected the edi processes in some way on those=20
occasions.

Call me if you think these files are yours and you need some help in knowing=
=20
how to re-send.
