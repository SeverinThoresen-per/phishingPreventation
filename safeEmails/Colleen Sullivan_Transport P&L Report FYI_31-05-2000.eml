Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty=20
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract=20
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l=20
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by=20
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market=20
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract=
=20
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it=20
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets. =20

Any thoughts ?
