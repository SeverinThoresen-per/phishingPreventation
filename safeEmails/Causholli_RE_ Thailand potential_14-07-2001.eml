Hi Monika,

Great to hv you onboard. I have already seen all the postings on the Fundy w=
ebsite but nothing new. All I need is some other pulp presentations done for=
 other companies. I just need to follow the format and use some of the slide=
s to modify.=20

I need some information on Phoenix Pulp regard their new increase in capacit=
y. They are having some expansion plan in their mill. Their capacity will in=
crease by another 220,000mt in the year 2003/4. Please help me check it out.=
 Please find out what kind of pulp will they be producing in this new capaci=
ty.

Thanks

David,

I am replacing  Dimitri as the pulp analyst so in the future send the reques=
ts to me.

First, we do not have any readily available presentations on any of those tw=
o companies.
You can go to the EIM fundies website under companies and there is some info=
 there about Advance Agro Public, I am not sure about Phoenix Pulp though.=20

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exact=
ly what you want reported on these two companies?

let me know if this helps,
thanks
Monika Causholli
