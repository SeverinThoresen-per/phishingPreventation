meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal. =20
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete=20
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be take=
n=20
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the=20
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did=20
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they us=
e=20
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of=20
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future=20
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge tha=
t=20
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of=20
default. =20

o=20
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his=20
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed. =
