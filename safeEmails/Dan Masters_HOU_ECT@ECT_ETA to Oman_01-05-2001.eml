I have spoken to Oman LNG about our ETA.  They are unable to move forward th=
e ship due to load after the "Hoegh Galleon".  They have asked that we try t=
o arrive as early as possible on May 13 so that departure on April 14 can be=
 achieved.

Please advise as soon as information is available on the progress of the wor=
k.

Regards,
Dan Masters
