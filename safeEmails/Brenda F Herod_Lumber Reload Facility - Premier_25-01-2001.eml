Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial=20
stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago=20
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy=20
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this=20
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in=20
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and=20
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued=20
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began=20
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have=20
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised=20
significant concerns.  Although Enron has not received written notification,=
=20
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be=20
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner,=20
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another=20
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in=20
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the=20
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have=
=20
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or=20
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been=20
incurring "switching" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying=20
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes an=
d=20
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very=
=20
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product=20
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as "Enron=
"=20
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are=20
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be=20
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, s=
o=20
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was=20
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for=20
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal=20
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started=20
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign=
=20
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather=
=20
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline,=20
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is=20
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT,=20
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next=20
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is=20
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads =3D 135). =20
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would=20
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About=
=20
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the=20
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can tak=
e=20
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take=20
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing=20
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax,=20
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and=20
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda=
,=20
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
