Transmission Line Delays Hit Scottish Generators

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Construction of a long-awaited transmission line that=20
would boost access of Scottish generators to the English market remains on=20
hold because of foot-and-mouth related restrictions, the National Grid Group=
=20
PLC (NGG) told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.=20
"The North Yorkshire Transmission Line Project, that went on hold with the=20
onset of the foot-and-mouth epidemic late February, remains on hold because=20
construction teams cannot access areas classified as infected," said the=20
National Grid spokesman.
The 75-kilometer transmission line between Teeside and the Vale of York woul=
d=20
reduce the present bottleneck in northern England, allowing more=20
Scottish-generated electricity through to customers in England.=20
"This is particularly difficult for National Grid because we have an=20
obligation to facilitate competition," said the National Grid spokesman.=20
"This problem reduces the ability of players to compete, plain and simple."=20
The National Grid spokesman could not estimate when construction would=20
resume, but said, "Once we start, it will be at least two to three years=20
before the transmission line will be available for use."=20
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs could not comment=
=20
on when access restrictions would be lifted in the North Yorkshire area, but=
=20
a spokeswoman said, "We cannot even begin discussion of lifting restrictions=
=20
on access to infected areas, until four weeks after the last diagnosed case=20
has been killed, and the area cleaned and disinfected."=20
Generators in Scotland are hit hardest by the delay because it interferes=20
with their plans to compete more actively in electricity markets in England=20
and Wales.=20
A spokeswoman for Scottish and Southern Energy said, "We do have to improve=20
access to markets in England and Wales," and added, "While we understand the=
=20
circumstances, we still look forward to the increased flexibility that the=20
North Yorkshire line will provide."=20
A spokesman for Scottish Power said, "As a Scottish company, we want the=20
Yorkshire line, to further open the U.K. market to competition."=20
The National Grid spokesman said some newly built generation is waiting to=20
come on line pending completion of the line. Companies would not comment on=20
their involvement, citing commercial sensitivity.=20
According to National Grid, a 1,875 megawatt plant at Teeside is subject to=20
operational restrictions until the new transmission line is complete.=20
This plant enhanced the necessity for the new transmission line when it came=
=20
on line in 1993, because existing lines could not accommodate the total=20
capacity of the Teeside plant.=20
The plant is owned by a consortium, with Enron Europe owning half the shares=
=2E=20
Midlands Electricity (19%), Northern Electricity (15%), SWEB (8%), and SWALE=
C=20
(8%) make up the rest of the consortium.=20
Enron said the Teeside plant isn't subject to any operational restrictions.=20
National Grid first applied for governmental consent for the new 4,840=20
megavolt amps transmission line in 1991. After two public inquiries,=20
extensive planning, and conflicts with groups opposing the construction, the=
y=20
received consent to begin construction in July of 2000, and began in=20

Tacoma Power estimates West Coast power generators and marketers owe it $72=20
million in refunds for power bought on the open market between October 2000=20
and May, when wholesale prices surged more than 10 times over previous=20
levels.=20
The estimates, filed in affidavits with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
Judge Curtis Wagner Jr., are the first from the utilities since electricity=20
prices began their sharp run-up last summer.
Wagner said Monday he would recommend negotiations continue over an effort b=
y=20
Northwest utilities to recover what they now estimate was more than $680=20
million in alleged overcharges to the region's electricity ratepayers.=20
Other estimates included Seattle City Light, $222 million, and Snohomish=20
Public Utility District, $229 million. The Bonneville Power Administration=20
estimated it should receive up to $140 million in refunds from purchases it=20
had to make as a result of the second worst drought in the region's history.=
=20
But Bonneville also sold electricity at various times in the California=20
market. And while some utilities in California believe Bonneville owes them=20
money, BPA said in its affidavit it has "no liability" for refunds.=20
Wagner has spent the past 15 days trying to negotiate a settlement both for=20
Northwest utilities and California, where the state has estimated consumers=20
are owed $8.9 billion.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had given Wagner and those involved=
=20
in the negotiations until Monday to reach an agreement. With the unsuccessfu=
l=20
end to those talks, Wagner now has a week to make a recommendation to the=20
commission, which would then decide on the refunds.=20
But Wagner, in outlining what his recommendation might include, indicated he=
=20
wasn't convinced the Northwest had been treated fairly in the negotiations=20
because so much of the focus was on California.=20
"With regard to the Northwest, I may very well recommend further negotiation=
s=20
with a settlement judge because they have not really had their day in court,=
"=20
he said.=20
Philip Chabot, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who represented Tacoma Power in th=
e=20
negotiations, said he thought the judge's suggestion for additional=20
negotiations was a good one.=20
"California is the 500-pound gorilla, they drive the market and they have=20
driven the negotiations," Chabot said. "Obviously, we weren't successful in=20
getting a settlement. But we moved the process forward. It would be all to=20
the good if we got negotiations focusing on the Northwest."=20
Simon ffitch, a Washington assistant attorney general who represented the=20
state in the talks, said he too thought Wagner's interest in additional=20
Northwest talks was a positive development.=20
"We support that," ffitch said. "I am disappointed we couldn't reach a=20
broader agreement, but we gave it a good try. We are at the beginning of the=
=20
process."=20
The attorneys general of Washington, Oregon and California are investigating=
=20
whether they have grounds for an antitrust or criminal case against West=20
Coast power generators and marketers. Regardless of the talks, ffitch said=20
that investigation would continue.=20
But Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Edmonds) said she wasn't convinced negotiations=20
for the Northwest should follow a separate track because the Californians=20
were providing much of the pressure for a settlement.=20
"If at some point we have to peel off, fine. But maybe we should stick with=20
California," said Cantwell, who had pushed federal regulators into allowing=20
the Northwest into the talks in the first place, then had to convince=20
skeptical utilities in the state to send representatives.=20
Cantwell said she wasn't surprised at the estimates Tacoma, Seattle and=20
Snohomish submitted in their affidavits to the judge. All three utilities=20
have had to raise their retail rates by up to 50 percent.=20
Of the power generators and marketers Tacoma said had overcharged, many were=
=20
actually Northwest-based, including Avista Energy of Spokane, PPL Montana,=20
the Chelan County Public Utility District, Grant County Public Utility=20
District, Idaho Power and Puget Sound Energy. But others included some of th=
e=20
nation's major energy suppliers, including TransAlta and Enron.=20
In determining the refunds, Tacoma and the other utilities calculated that=20
any electricity bought above $150 per megawatt was subject to a refund. By=20
comparison, prior to the current West Coast energy crisis, utilities paid=20
between $30 and $40 a megawatt. At the height of the crisis, electricity cos=
