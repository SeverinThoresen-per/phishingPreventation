I had a good "clear the air" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a=20
couple things that will improve the process.=20

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades withou=
t=20
calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.  Sean,=20
please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.  Call=20
me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis=20
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is in=
=20
a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with=20
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do fixed=
=20
price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more attractive=20
pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below. =20
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and=20
power contract master).

Thanks

Sean,
?
As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the=20
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the months=
=20
of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.
?
Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.? I=
n=20
every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was no=20
less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.? Gelbe=
r=20
questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to end the=
=20
telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber called=20
Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of the=20
necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August we=20
received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer spread.?=
=20
However,  on the month of July the price received was not only outside of th=
e=20
then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher than the NYMEX hig=
h=20
for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the Citizen's Arizona Gas=20
price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340, the high for the day on=20
NYMEX was  $5.290.
?
I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My=20
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is m=
y=20
understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your=20
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices u=
p=20
when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.
?
Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for securin=
g=20
fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.
?
Sincerely,
?
