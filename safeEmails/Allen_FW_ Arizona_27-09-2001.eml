I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of pl=
anned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the A=
rizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconn=
ecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliabili=
ty and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this=
 matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know.=20
