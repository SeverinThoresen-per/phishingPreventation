Linda,

I can't make 10 tomorrow, so go ahead and meet without me.

Lunch this week would be difficult, as I'm out Thursday and Friday attending=
 the SW Legal Foundation Labor seminar in Dallas.  Would you like to try som=
ething next week with me and Lizzette Palmer, my new attorney?  If so, have =
your assistant get with Twanda at 853-9402 to schedule, as Twanda works for =
both me and Lizzette.

Thanks.

Michelle
