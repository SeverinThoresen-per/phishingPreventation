Margaret advises that you need info on Joe Kishkill.  Here's all that is on =
the EI drive.  If you are looking for an executive employment agreement, we =
don't have access to those.

 << File: BrazilTerm.doc >>  << File: BrazilTermRev9.99.xls.doc >>  << File:=
 ext.doc >>=20

If you need anything additional, Robin Treadwell may be able to assist.

Thanks,=20
