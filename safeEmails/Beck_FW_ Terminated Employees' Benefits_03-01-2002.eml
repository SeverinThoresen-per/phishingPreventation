Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good frie=
nds during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  I =
talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get upda=
tes from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do whate=
ver I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason for =
my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they =
need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more about=
 the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their way =
right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, not e=
ven send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these benefits,=
 because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated (or in=
active).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed?  Plea=
se realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck coming in, =
no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, no medical=
 benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets do somethin=
g to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ employees st=
atus changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish this.  Whomever=
 is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sense of urgency=
 about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, etc. while they =
are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Sabra Dinari
