Subject: Stingray Agency



We are agent for Enterprise, Petsec, and Pennzoil (Devon) on Stingray.  Pets=
ec
and Pennzoil (Devon) are filling out the appropriate forms and should send t=
o
you for your signature today.  There in nobody at Enterprise to sign the
form.   I am still working with Stingray regarding the agency between Enron=20
and
CES.  I thought this was taken care of but maybe not.  I am working with a
backup that is confusing.  I will follow up.  In summary, I think Enron will
have to nominate on CES contracts because I do not feel all this will get do=
ne
today.  Especially, Enterprise Oil.

Janet
