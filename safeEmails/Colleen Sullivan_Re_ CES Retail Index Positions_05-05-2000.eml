Steve--who will follow up on this to make sure the Retail volumes get=20
booked?  Per Scott's e-mail below, he does want them booked for the remainin=
g=20
term.

I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons belo=
w=20
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or=20
31st.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but=
=20
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so=20
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don'=
t=20
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tel=
l=20
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our=20
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely=20
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or=20
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This=
=20
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if=20
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in=20
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you=20
want. =20

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are=20
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to=
=20
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong=
=20
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick=
=20
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris=20
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me. =20
