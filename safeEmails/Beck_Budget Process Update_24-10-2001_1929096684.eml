EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday,=
 October 24 to Monday, November 5.  Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message t=
oday with revised dates for budget reviews. =20

McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the revi=
ew of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coo=
rdinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an =
update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current =
allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL alloc=
ation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology. =20

Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a=
 class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.=
  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the int=
ent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday. =20

Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that =
on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01=
, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subjec=
t to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews wi=
th EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business unit=
s are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Wha=
lley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions sinc=
e our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally=20
