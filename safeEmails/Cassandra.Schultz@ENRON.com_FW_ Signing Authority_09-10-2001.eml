Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick sta=
rt signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he =
starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you ha=
d to do for me. =20

I think so.  It makes sense for Rick to sign on these accounts.  I will be t=
alking to Tom Doukas in the next day to get him focused on his accounts that=
 need to be updated for Enron Credit Inc.  Thanks .Donna

I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we=
 want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory=
 on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?
