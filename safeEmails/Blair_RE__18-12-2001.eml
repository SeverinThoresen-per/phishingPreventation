Lynn, currently the Bushton Imbalance through October 2001 reflects a volume=
 of 76,862 MMBTUs and a dollar amount of $757,607.21 due Oneok (Oneok long t=
o Northern).  Currently, the month to date volume for December shows Oneok s=
hort to Northern by 45,904 MMBTUs.  Continuing with this trend, Oneok will r=
educe the imbalance amount Northern owes them.
If you have any questions, please call me.
