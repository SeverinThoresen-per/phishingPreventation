Done.

FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the=20
delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This=20
should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th,=
=20
we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a=20
spot agreement (#484935).

Let me know if you have any questions.
