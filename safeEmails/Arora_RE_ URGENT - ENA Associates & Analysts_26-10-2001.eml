 << File: ENA Participation.xls >>=20
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at =
Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it i=
s important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews an=
d debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These =
de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wi=
sh to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to bu=
siness units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the =
participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please=
 encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below even=
ts in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for In=
terview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Inte=
rivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for I=
nterview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe hi=
ghlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA
