Thanks very much Mark.  Great article. =20

 I picked up a biography of O'Brian a while back and have been warming up to=
=20
it slowly.  Not sure I want to know a lot about the guy, not because it isn'=
t=20
interesting, but because I feel I already know more about him than I can=20
really handle, even if that quantity is but  a small part of the best of wha=
t=20
he was, the size of that part being directly proportional to my ability to=20
plumb the depths of what he was writing.    This whole notion of a remarkabl=
e=20
turning point,  a place where a guy just looks at his sordid past and say:=20
"it didn't happen, I am somebody else," is fascinating. I wonder if that is=20
what happened to the old Apostle Paul when he was struck by that light and=20
just got up and took off in a completely different way?   I have struggled i=
n=20
perhaps an analagous way with making sense of how I have ended up toiling in=
=20
a giant Casino.  What the hell is a Mennonite farm boy drop out  doing=20
working at the very core of the economy which all of his history has require=
d=20
his people to remain on the very fringes of?  I find myself telling myself=20
that when I enter the doors to the Casino in the morning I am another person=
,=20
Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman energy attorney.  Thinking of myself in=20
the third person really helps.  O'Brian interests me biographically for this=
=20
reason.  He didn't like his first run at life as Mr. Russ and so  he just=20
created a different one for himself through his art, Mr. Obrian.  All of thi=
s=20
fascinates one enormously.  I'll probably start my second run through his=20
books before too long.  How are you doing within the nautical analogy=20
lately?  Thanks again for sharing the article. ----cgy =20

Subject: O'Brian article

I found this on a sailing magazine web page:

An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick=
=20
O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing=
=20
in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about=20
everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my=
=20
doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen=20
O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation=20
and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire=20
series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I fel=
t=20
compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful,=20
life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the=
=20
sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my=20
Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends=20
without any interfering presence from myself.=20

I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving=
=20
such a letter and her interesting reply was, "I get about 20,000 letters per=
=20
year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do=20
anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent=
=20
him from accepting." So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea=20
where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his=20
handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying "I accept your=
=20
kind offer with perhaps obscene haste."
As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995=
=20
that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit=20
and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. Hi=
s=20
host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and=20
alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic=
=20
manner.=20

The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere=20
for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr.=20
O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous=20
interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First=20
Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmente=
d=20
my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series=20
of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious=20
drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in=
=20
the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the=20
practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.

After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each=20
other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean=20
and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise.=20

I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the=20
Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque=20
country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick=20
all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a=20
stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour=20
of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt=
=20
possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port=20
calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots?=20

As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a=20
desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could=
=20
not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control=20
and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end=20
that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely=20
that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht.=20
?
In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting=20
Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up.=20
Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was=
=20
one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all=20
telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian=20
and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest an=
d=20
charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes=
,=20
pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his=20
office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with=20
reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology,=20
medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later=20
than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work.=20

The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and=20
foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit an=
d=20
his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visi=
t=20
all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an=20
additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he=20
boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver,=20
short-changing him on his yachting holiday.

Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind,=20
the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the=
=20
helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and=20
frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to=20
suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth=
=20
were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like=20
Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a=20
day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of=20
seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to=
=20
have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I=20
constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but=20
thankfully this never occurred.=20

Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink=20
called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with=20
relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the=20
center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level o=
f=20
sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had=20
ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I=20
was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for=
=20
cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a=20
marvel to follow.=20

The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca.=20
O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channe=
l=20
leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between=20
Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size,=20
but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting=20
afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense=20
enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue=
=2E=20
That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the=20
first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.

And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in=20
everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the=
=20
port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor=20
on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousand=
s=20
of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character=20
Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personalit=
y.
?
One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which=20
led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick=20
asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University o=
f=20
Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's=
=20
English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of=20
Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which=
=20
Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was=20
destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so=
=20
that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels.=20

Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite=20
startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and=
=20
reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's=20
letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist.=20

Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he,=20
Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of "some post-doctoral American=20
fool." So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist=20
framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require=
=20
either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame=
=20
of mind at the time of creation.=20

Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his=20
own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated=
,=20
not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of=20
his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth=20
and understood his deep motives.

The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine=
=20
Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in=20
light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned ou=
t=20
- an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a=20
small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one=20
can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks=
=20
and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trun=
k=20
with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long=20
hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension,=
=20
we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster.=20
Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed=
,=20
I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment.=20

One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly=20
established, Patrick said, "Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question=20
which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern=20
world. What is software?" My answer, "The piano is the hardware and the shee=
t=20
music is the software," satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.

Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office=20
to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the=20
yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate=
=20
detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to=
=20
Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never=
=20
shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the=20
original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I=20
treasure.

Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business=
=20
required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on=
=20
to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that=20
island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Por=
t=20
Vendres.

My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year=
=2E=20
We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner=
=20
Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his=20
books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly.
