Here's the response I got with regards to Tomcat. I've place another call=20
into David and let him know that the information we received included most=20
points except for Tomcat. I'll keep you informed.=20

What I know is that the gas is sourced at MI 587 and moved on KM's firm=20
contract. For as long as CES remembers, they sell the gas to Entex. Entex=20
chooses the pipe off which they take--usually Midcon--also, HPL Channel, or=20
Tejas. KM is invoiced directly. Volume is approx. 2395. The deal with Entex=20
is written up monthly. KM pays on a basket of indices. Entex pays on the=20
highest index.

The response I got from our risk desk was that your structuring group has
already been provided all of this information ... so you probably need to=20
check
with them.  My guess would be Tetco STX is where the Tomcat gas belongs.
