Chris,
As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand=
=20
to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay=20
through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in=
=20
Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to curren=
t.

Thanks,
Mark
