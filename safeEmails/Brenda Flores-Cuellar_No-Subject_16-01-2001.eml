Hey Jim,

How's it going?  It's that time of year again.  Please don't forget me shoul=
d=20
you have any leftover rodeo tickets.  I will be forever greatful as with all=
=20
the other times.  I see one that I am particularly interested in (Def=20
Leppard).  I'd like to get four for that one if you happen to come across=20
any.  Sorry to be such a bug already.  I feel bad asking since I'm not part=20
of the group anymore.  Well, let me know if you should have any leftovers=20
that you just can't seem to get rid of at the last minute.  Thanks bud! =20
Sorry to write only when I want something.
