Please read note below from our SAP Timekeeping Team:


By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping=20
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in=20
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other busines=
s=20
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will=
=20
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation,=20
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new=
=20
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeepe=
r=20
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period=
=20
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new=
=20
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more tim=
e=20
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have=20
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary=20
adjustments will be made the following pay period.
