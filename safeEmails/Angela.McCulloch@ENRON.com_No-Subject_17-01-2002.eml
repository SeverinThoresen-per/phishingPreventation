Title: Atlantic Basin Distillate Market Update
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2932;


***********************************************************************

ATLANTIC BASIN DISTILLATE MARGINS PRESSURED BY WEAK DEMAND AND AMPLE STOCKS

In stark contrast to last winter's exceptional strength, spot distillate-to-
crude price differentials in Atlantic Basin markets are likely to stay weak:

Demand is down relative to a year ago, resulting from declining air travel,
mild temperatures in North America, and much lower North American natural ga=
s
prices.

* Inventory levels are comfortable, with primary inventories in the United
States and consumer stocks in Germany particularly high.

* Market psychology is preoccupied with the weak economy and downside risks,
whereas a year ago a psychology of shortage prevailed in energy markets.

***********************************************************************

GAS PRICES CONTINUE DOWNWARD DRIFT--HIGH STORAGE, LOW DEMAND

While warm weather keeps heating loads low, the key driver in natural gas
markets continues to be the looming storage surplus. Weather may provide som=
e
short-lived price spikes in February, but until real evidence of the
anticipated decline in US supply appears, prices will feel continued downwar=
d
pressure from record-high storage inventories. The projected February averag=
e
price is $2.10 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub.

* March storage inventories will end at record high levels. Ample gas remain=
s
to keep prices low until a rebounding economy and declining supplies can
provide a lift.

* With return to a normal weather, strong industrial loads will boost overal=
l
gas demand slightly over last year's levels.

* Diminishing weather-related support and high western storage inventories w=
ill
drive widening discounts to the Henry Hub in the western producing areas, wh=
ile
weak demand and high storage will limit premiums in the East.
