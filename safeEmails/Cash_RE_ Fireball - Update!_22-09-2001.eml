I agree with your take.  Plus, how will those employees be hired?  Is it par=
t of the deal?  If so, then we will need to figure out how to document it.  =

In light of your comments below, it now seems wise for us to schedule a meet=
ing with you to find out which employees will move to Enron and agree on add=
itional information we will need.  Also, if Enron staff will be doing all th=
e back office/logistics, I'm assuming some sort of services agreement will b=
e put in place.  At a minimum, I suggest Noel, Michelle Cash and I meet with=
 you.  Shanna may or may not attend, but we would need to coordinate compens=
ation with Shanna to maintain equity within the Coal marketing group.

I'll have my assistant, Elisa Tamez, contact you to set up a meeting for nex=
t Monday or Tuesday.

Thanks.

Cindy: Thank you for your response.  Our current plan is that the three mark=
eters that Triton currently employs will become employees of Enron.  This wi=
ll facilitate the coordination with our existing marketers and logistics peo=
ple.  Enron will also handle all of the scheduling, sampling, and "back offi=
ce" support.  As such, we may or may not need additional people for these ta=
sks.  We will keep you posted once we know more about the needs of our group=
 from an HR perspective.

Due to the new structure of the deal, no further HR information will be requ=
ired.  Would appreciate further description on how Enron will market the Tri=
ton coal, i.e., do we need to help find additional coal marketers/originator=
s, or will we use existing Coal Group and Triton marketers to handle this.  =
You may not have answers to this yet, but if we can help coordinate through =
Shanna and/or our recruiting group, please let us know.

All:=20

As some of you know, and many may not, we are still working on Project Fireb=
all. Over the past month we have been negotiating with the Vulcan investors =
to create a structure that benefits both Vulcan and Enron.  We have gone fro=
m a structure where Enron would own 100% of the company to one that includes=
 some equity, debt, and marketing. We feel fairly confident that we are clos=
e to agreeing on a deal that will involve the following basic components:

Enron will pay Vulcan $ 100 million cash for the following:=20
        $  40 million will be to purchase somewhere around 18% to 19% of the=
 equity in Triton Coal Company=20
        $  60 million will be to refinance subordinated debt that Vulcan cur=
rently has with UBS (Enron will then provide financing of this $60 MM)

        Enron will become the exclusive marketer for Triton coal and will re=
ceive a fee on each ton of coal sold (based on % of sales price)

We have indicated to Vulcan that we can close this deal within 30 days of th=
eir notification of acceptance of our bid. Some final due diligence issues n=
eed to be addressed by Enron before closing. The attached file includes a li=
st of due diligence items that we have requested that are still outstanding.=
  Many of these may not apply, now that we will not purchase the entire comp=
any. Once Vulcan has accepted our bid we will need to move quickly and will =
need to let Triton know what outstanding issues we have to resolve. Please r=
eview this list and let me know by Monday afternoon of any items that we do =
not require in light of the new structure of the deal.

We will set meetings with many of you for Monday and Tuesday of next week to=
 ensure a smooth closing process if we are selected.  Please let me know if =
you have any questions.=20

Thanks to everyone for your continued support on this deal.=20
