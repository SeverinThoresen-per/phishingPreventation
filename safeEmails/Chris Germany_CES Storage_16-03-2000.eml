I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like=20
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several=20
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and=20
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection=20
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal=20
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what=20
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know ho=
w=20
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?
