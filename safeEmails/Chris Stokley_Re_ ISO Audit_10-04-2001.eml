Chris and Murray,

Jane requested that I follow up with you regarding EPMI's need for ISO audit
agreed-upon procedures.  (I visited the Cal ISO website, and did not readily=
 see
discussion of 2000 audit requirements.)

Please let us know as soon as possible if you will need our assistance, as w=
e
are in the midst of our 2001 planning.

FYI - Jane is no longer with Arthur Andersen.  Debra Cash is our engagement
partner, and I am an engagement senior.

Thanks,
Linda
