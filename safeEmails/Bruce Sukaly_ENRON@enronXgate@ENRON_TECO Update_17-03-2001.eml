We received their redraft of the doc yesterday, it needed a lot of work.  We=
 will return the draft on Monday morning.  We are combining the QSE contract=
 into the Energy Management Agreement.  In addition, there is a master purch=
ase agreement as well.  This results in quite a bit of legal work.  TECO ind=
icated they are undermanned at this time and the turnaround will be slow. Fr=
om a business concept standpoint we really don't have any "deal killer" issu=
es.   I think we can get the deal done by the quarter's end at the latest an=
d probably late next week.  But then depends on TECO's turnaround time.  Stu=
art Zisman and Mark Haedicke are going to meet with Lavo on Wednesday to tal=
k legal risks associated with this deal and these types of deals.  I'll be t=
here and I'll let you know the time in case your are interested.
