Point well taken.  I softened the language up after sending out the e-mail, =
but can probably go further.  As to protection of intellectual property, the=
 employees still have that obligation correct? Our concern is that we spent =
$17MM for the IP, and we now have a former employee brazenly declaring that =
he can use our IP to start his own business.

Although all employees did sign the non-compete, I believe (without doing an=
y research on Florida law) that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to=
 enforce since there is no ongoing business of AMPS to protect.  As such, I =
believe that such a statement is kind of like rubbing salt into the wounds o=
f these employees. =20
=20
A gentle reminder of confidentiality would be appropriate, but any mention o=
f a non-compete probably would not be well received.

 AMPS employees:=20
Please advise.=20

NON-COMPETE/CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

When you became an AMPS employee, you signed a confidentiality and non-compe=
te agreement promising to maintain company information in strict confidence.=
  The provisions of the confidentiality agreement include a non-compete agre=
ement, which is in effect for 24 months after you leave AMPS.  The non-compe=
te and confidentiality provisions are in effect, and we would like to remind=
 you of your responsibility not to share proprietary company information wit=
h new employers or competitors of AMPS until the expiration of the 24-month =
period.  If you have any questions, please refer to the employment agreement=
 which you signed when you became an AMPS employee.
