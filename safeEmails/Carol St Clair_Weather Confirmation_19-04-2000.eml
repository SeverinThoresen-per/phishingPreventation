Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to=20
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with=
=20
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20=20
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph =
1.


Will you pass it on
