Hi Sara, I hope that you (& your car) are okay and safe in light of the floo=
ds. =20

By way of update, I am trying my best to get the ISDA comparison done by tom=
orrow and am hoping although not sure that it can get done before you go on =
vacation.  On Friday, I had several unanticipated meetings/emergencies and t=
hen had to leave work at 6:30 -- earlier than I had anticipated -- in light =
of the rain.  In light of the flooding, I was not able to get back to the of=
fice and the file over the weekend as I had planned.  This morning I have an=
other urgent emergency  -- I was just made aware that we absolutely have to =
get a brokerage agreement executed for Enron Credit Inc. today so I have to =
focus on getting that done. =20

My extended family here are down two cars due to the flooding so I might hav=
e to leave work at about 5:30 today to make sure that I can meet my ride to =
get home safely.

I am sure that I can take the file home tonight to work on the issues but I =
am not sure whether I will be finished. =20
