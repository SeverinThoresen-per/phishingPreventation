Microsoft's in-house counsel called me on my cell phone a few minutes ago.  =
He just wanted to let me know that they received our proposal this morning a=
nd that they have retained Preston Gates & Ellis LLP to assist them in revie=
wing and analyzing our proposal.  He said they would be getting back with us=
 shortly -- hopefully tomorrow -- and said that his business folks where int=
ent on moving "forward instead of backward," whatever that means.
