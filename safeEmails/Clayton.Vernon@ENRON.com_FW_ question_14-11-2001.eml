John-

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Sa=
vings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our as=
set allocations or contribution rules until November 20. This has generated =
an awful lot of resentment and deep conspiracy theories. Can you ask the Boa=
rd to offer a remedy to those affected by this?
