Kevin, given the track record of mis-behaviour, I don't fault you with the p=
remise of guilt before understanding.  But I would like to assure you that d=
espite the high valuations externally, which I probably agree are fantasy, T=
he Facility Services Group has a clear vision/market; it has a quality manag=
ement team; it will be under my thumb and it is conservatively valued in the=
 books.  It is much more that a Blockbuster or other like structure.  If you=
 would like to discuss in detail do not hesitate to give me a call and I wil=
l take you through it - both overall strategy and tactics.  Even though it h=
as been a confluence of events which has caused our problems, the fundamenta=
l root of most issues is an inactive management team which hasn't managed th=
e detail as well as we would like.  New Power in my view would not have been=
 as big a loser if we had kept it private and managed it closely as a key pa=
rt of the business.  Instead we took it public and let it run amok.  I think=
 you can see parallels across the company.  Initially well intentioned and t=
hought out strategies fall apart when not managed appropriately.

Regards
Delainey
