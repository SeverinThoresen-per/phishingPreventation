Subject: PGE Trading Limits


Rick,
=20
I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open po=
sition (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to =
better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and p=
ortfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concu=
rred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
=20
1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its=
 long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, =
I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its reg=
ulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the elect=
ric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE'=
s natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After redu=
cing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the=
 regulated electric portfolio.
=20
2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessa=
ry to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been us=
ing a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've re=
calculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
=20
If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questio=
ns please contact me at (503) 464-2723.

Thanks.
