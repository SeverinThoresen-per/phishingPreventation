Pursuant to the HoustonStreet Price Posting Agreement and subsequent amendme=
nt, the companies have conducted extensive Interface testing.  The testing h=
as been an iterative process over several weeks and has included both stress=
 testing and unit testing.  The testing was conducted to ensure interface fu=
nctionality and load performance.

On May 7 - 8, 2001 we tested with HoustonStreet to determine whether the Spo=
nsor Interface Acceptance Criteria had been met.  Based upon the following r=
esults I do not believe that all the criteria have been met and recommend ag=
ainst putting the Interfaces into production.

1.  Although the Sponsor was able to accept continuous price updates we expe=
rienced a 1 - 8 second time variance between price updates on EnronOnline an=
d price updates on HoustonStreet.   Testing periods of up to 1.5 hours were =
included in the testing.  Price updates during the testing ranged from 20 - =
40 updates per second with peaks of approximately 60 updates per second.  Th=
e 1 - 8 second delay on the HoustonStreet website will result in a high perc=
entage of failed transactions with Enron.

2.  No testing was done at 100 -200 updates per second. =20

3. HoustonStreet was unable to do a three day uninterrupted period to allow =
for testing.  As a result of incidents seen in the testing on May 8, 2001, H=
oustonStreet was still making adjustments to software as evidenced by the Ma=
y 11, 2001 email from John Whyman of HoustonStreet.  Without a three day "qu=
iet" period we are unable to finish testing the functionality of the interfa=
ces.  Until such time as the software and hardware are locked down, we canno=
t be assured that changes that are being made are not impacting the results =
of previous testing.  Essentially without a lock down period we could not be=
 sure that any functionality would work when we went live.

4. HoustonStreet did provide an excel matrix for displaying the Enron produc=
t descriptions.  Enron requested that the matrix be prominently displayed on=
 the Sponsor Platform.  We were unable to view the matrix on the Sponsor Pla=
tform.   If the matrix was not prominently displayed on the HoustonStreet we=
bsite, customers transacting on HoustonStreet may actually buy or sell a pro=
duct that is different than they thought.  The matrix was required to ensure=
 that anyone transacting with Enron would know exactly what product they wer=
e dealing with based upon the EnronOnline short description.

5. Functionality testing could not be completed due to the inability to do a=
 three-day uninterrupted test as required in number 3 above.  As long as cha=
nges to the software and hardware continued Enron can not be assured that ch=
anges would not impact system functionality.  We had planned to do a test of=
 all functionality during the three-day quiet period.  Testing of system fun=
ctionality that was conducted on May 7 - 8 revealed the following critical i=
ssues:

We saw incidents of incorrect Enron price updates posting on the Sponsor Pla=
tform.  One specific examples included a crossed market display with a bid p=
rice of $6.00+ and an offer price <$1.00
We experienced instances of both successful and failed transaction messaging=
 that were delayed anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes.
We experienced successful transactions with Enron with no corresponding resp=
onses back to the Sponsor Platform.
We experienced instances where price updates were causing products to appear=
 and disappear.  HoustonStreet indicated that the issue was the result of in=
correct mapping.

Given the functionality problems we witnessed, a disconnect between Enron an=
d the customer as to what transactions have been entered into would occur.  =
This disconnect would result in substantial price exposure during the period=
 that the trade is not confirmed.  In addition, given the timing of the conf=
irmations (positive and negative) a customer might be confused as to which c=
onfirmation was associated with which transaction attempt.  This situation o=
nce again would result in exposure from price movements in the markets. =20
