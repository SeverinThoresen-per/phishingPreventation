Cynthia:
Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone=
=20
and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice. =20
Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

Carol
