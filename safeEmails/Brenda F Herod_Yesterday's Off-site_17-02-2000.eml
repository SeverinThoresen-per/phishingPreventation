Just want to pat each of you on the back, and express my appreciation to eac=
h=20
of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday.  The results=
=20
of our time exceeded my expectations in that I feel we had quality discussio=
n=20
and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly.  Each=20
of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and=20
positive manner.   I also realize we have some follow-up to do, and would=20
like for us to schedule our next time to meet.  I don't want to establish=20
these discussions as "quarterly" or "monthly" meetings at this point - I'm=20
not sure what frequency would be appropriate.  We can discuss it further as =
a=20
team.  However, I know we at least one more session and I don't want much=20
time to elapse before we reconvene.=20

Yvette:  Would look at a time when everyone would be availble in March,=20
preferably the week of 3/6, 3/13 or 3/20.  This may be difficult to schedule=
=20
as Daren will be working around a new baby, and others are working around=20
vacation time.  I anticipate a similar structure to yesterday's, but am very=
=20
open to other's ideas.  Please let Yvette know if you some other idea.

I also want to express my appreciation to Yvette for organizing the=20
afternoon.  She did a great job!!!

Thanks to each of you!!
