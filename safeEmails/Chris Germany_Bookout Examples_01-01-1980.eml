Here are a couple of real bookout examples for October.

These are deals Brian Perrone did.
New Power purchased gas from ENA for deliveries to WGL.
Deal #377264
The price is NX! + .325 and the volume is 15014/month.

Since New Power is taking all deliveries on CGAS, I buy the TRCO gas back at=
=20

IF CGAS  $5.5500
FOM Prem  $.0075
CGAS Transport $.1468
ENA Oct Demand $.06

Total   $5.7643

The actual volumes for WGL are included in the large sale to New Power on=20
CGAS.  The pricing looks strange because ENA is paying New Power a $.06=20
demand charge for transport.  Since this is a citygate NYMX deal, I treat it=
=20
the same as if New Power=20
