Noble is gone this weekend if you want to make another trip to Corpus.  It
looks like I will be a good weekend for fishing and nighttime entertainment.
Charlie and Bruce Robison are going to be in town for this Thursday -
hopefully it will be a good show.

Everthing is going great.  I heard that you division got purchased by a
Swiss bank or something to that effect.  Please verify?

Are you doing OK?

   difference
   in performance.

   Later,
