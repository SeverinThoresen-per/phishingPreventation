We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to=
=20
Midcoast.  You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.  Just a note=
,=20
we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much highe=
r=20
transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $=
0=20
transport cost.  Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in=
=20
this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.

By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.  The IT=20
feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001, fuel remain=
s=20
unchanged at .45%.

Subject: Hey Buddy - Transco question for you

First, let me start by saying I miss seeing your happy face every day!! Now,=
=20
that being said, I have a question!!!

Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for.  I=20
have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the=20
EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco, Zn3WH (ticket 547342).

The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta 65 less transport=20
and fuel.  In the past months, we have nominated this gas on one of our IT=20
contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of .0792 plus .45%=20
fuel.  That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect=20
what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas...

In January, from the 13th - 16th, we nominated 2009/day from EI57 and=20
transported it on IT contract .2774 for delivery to Midcoast Marketing, Inc.=
=20
(ticket 568318) @ Z3-Ethel Midla meter 6083.
This path incurred a higher fee than the other two paths that were nominated=
=20
either to our pool or to Mamou. =20

The Ethel Midla delivery fees included:
ACA .0022
EP3 .0013=20
GP .0097 (great plains surcharge ??)
GRI .0070
VC .0448=20
ZN3 .0331
total .0981

The pool and Mamou delivery fees only included:
EP3 .0013
VC .0448
ZN3 .0331
total .0792

My question is....are any of the Ethel Midla fees passed on to the delivery=20
counterparty, Midcoast Marketing, Inc. ?=20
Or, is Juniper responsible for paying for the extra fees?

Thanks for your help=20

Trish
