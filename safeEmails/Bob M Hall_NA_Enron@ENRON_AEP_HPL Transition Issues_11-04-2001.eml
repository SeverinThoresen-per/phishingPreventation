Attached is an updated transitions list.

Please review and send any changes so I can update.

I will update again Thursday and will include a column for status.

We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a for=
mal protocol for AEP.

These are:

Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, =
procedures will
be completed.

Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.

Request for new employee security.

Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.

Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover th=
e=20
Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to contin=
ue
the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit=
 has request we suspend trading when
AEP wants to continue trading.

We have had discussions with AEP about all of these issues and procedures.
