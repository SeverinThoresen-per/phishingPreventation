Group,

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter =
months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to careful=
ly manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance of =
a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit=
 commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line =
and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energ=
y from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newm=
an 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in th=
e market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new =
vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing gro=
up. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but =
need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either=
 in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a =
part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently a=
s possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very =
difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should lo=
ok for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heater=
s come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 thro=
ugh HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sur=
e to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with =
ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(t=
he first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and=
 the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

Bill
