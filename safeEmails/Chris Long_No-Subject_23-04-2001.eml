On Friday, we informed you about the IRS announcement that it will resume=20
issuing private letter rulings on whether synthetic fuels produced from coal=
=20
qualify for a tax credit under tax code Section 29.  Following is additional=
=20
information from BNA.=20
Section 29 provides a credit for the production and sale of "qualified fuels=
"=20
produced from a nonconventional source, IRS said, including liquid, gaseous,=
=20
or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite. In Rev. Proc. 2000-4=
7=20
(209 DTR G-1, L-1, 10/27/00), IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section 29=20
because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not=
=20
processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress.=20
IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for=20
which taxpayers claimed the credit. It received numerous comment letters,=20
many urging it to resume issuing rulings, others agreeing that some processe=
s=20
should not qualify for the credit.  In Rev. Proc. 2001-30, IRS said it will=20
issue a ruling on processes it had approved prior to 2000. The production=20
process must meet the following requirements, IRS said:=20

substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant=20
chemical change;=20
the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal=20
comprised of particles no larger than 1/8 inch;=20
the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed: (a) with styrene or other=20
monomers following an acid bath, (b) with quinoline or other organic resin=20
and left to cure for several days, (c) with ultra heavy hydrocarbons, or (d)=

Rulings
On Whether Solid Fuel Produced From Coal Qualifies Under I.R.C. Section 29

Rev. Proc. 2001-30 is scheduled to appear in Internal Revenue Bulletin=20
2001-19, dated May 7, 2001.=20

Rev. Proc. 2001-30

SECTION 1. PURPOSE=20
This revenue procedure informs the public of the Internal Revenue Service's=20
decision to issue private letter rulings regarding whether a solid fuel=20
produced from coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C) of the Internal=20
Revenue Code under the circumstances described in section 3 of this revenue=20
procedure.=20
SECTION 2. BACKGROUND=20
Section 2.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3, 2001-1 I.R.B. 111, provides that whenever=
=20
appropriate in the interest of sound tax administration, it is the policy of=
=20
the Service to answer inquiries of individuals and organizations regarding=20
their status for tax purposes and the tax effects of their acts or=20
transactions, prior to the filing of returns or reports that are required by=
=20
the revenue laws. There are, however, certain areas in which, because of the=
=20
inherently factual nature of the problems involved, or for other reasons, th=
e=20
Service will not issue rulings or determinations letters.=20
Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 sets forth those areas in which rulings or=20
determination letters will not ordinarily be issued. "Not ordinarily" means=20
that unique and compelling reasons must be demonstrated to justify the=20
issuance of a ruling or determination letter. Section 2.01 of Rev. Proc.=20
2001-3.=20
Section 4.02(1) of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 provides that the Service will not=20
ordinarily issue rulings or determination letters regarding any matter in=20
which the determination requested is primarily one of fact, for example,=20
market value of property, or whether an interest in a corporation is to be=20
treated as stock or indebtedness.=20
Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 sets forth those areas under extensive study=20
in which rulings or determination letters will not be issued until the=20
Service resolves the issue through publication of a revenue ruling, revenue=20
procedure, regulations, or otherwise.=20
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 provides that the Service will not issue=20
rulings or determination letters on whether a solid fuel other than coke or =
a=20
fuel produced from waste coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C). Waste=20
coal for this purpose is limited to waste coal fines from normal mining and=20
crushing operations and does not include fines produced (for example, by=20
crushing run-of-mine coal) for the purpose of claiming the credit.=20
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 supersedes Rev. Proc. 2000-47, 2000-46=20
I.R.B. 482. Rev. Proc. 2000-47 was published because concern had been raised=
=20
that taxpayers were claiming the o29 credit for processing coal in ways that=
=20
may not have been intended by the Congress. Rev. Proc. 2000-47 requested=20
comments concerning the standard to be applied in determining whether fuel=20
produced from coal is a solid synthetic fuel. The Service received extensive=
=20
comments.=20
Section 29 provides a credit against income tax for the production and sale=20
of "qualified fuels" produced from a nonconventional source. Section=20
29(c)(1)(C) provides that qualified fuels include liquid, gaseous, or solid=20
synthetic fuels produced from coal (including lignite).=20
Rev. Rul. 86-100, 1986-2 C.B. 3, adopts for purposes of o29(c)(1)(C) the=20
definition of synthetic fuel in o 1.48-9(c)(5) of the Income Tax Regulations=
=2E=20
Section 1.489(c)(5)(ii) provides that, to be "synthetic," a fuel must differ=
=20
significantly in chemical composition, as opposed to physical composition,=20
from the substance used to produce it. Rev. Rul. 86-100 describes favorably=20
processes such as gasification, liquefaction, and production of solvent=20
refined coal that result in substantial chemical changes to the entire coal=20
feedstock rather than changes that affect only the surface of the coal.=20
Section 29(f) provides that o29 applies to qualified fuels that are produced=
=20
in a facility placed in service after December 31, 1979, and before January=20
1, 1993, and that are sold before January 1, 2003. Section 29(g)(1)(A)=20
provides that a facility for producing qualified fuels described in o29(c)
(1)(C) is treated for this purpose as being placed in service before January=
=20
1, 1993, if the facility is placed in service before July 1, 1998, pursuant=20
to a binding written contract in effect before January 1, 1997. For a=20
facility that meets this condition and is originally placed in service after=
=20
December 31, 1992, o29(g)(1)(B) provides that the o29 credit applies to=20
qualified fuels that are sold before January 1, 2008.=20
Property is "placed in service" in the taxable year the property is placed i=
n=20
a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically=20
assigned function. See, for example, o 1.167(a)11(e)(1)(i). Thus, the o29=20
credit is not allowed for fuel produced in a facility that was originally=20
placed in service for a function other than producing qualified fuel under=20
o29(c)(1)(C) and was not converted into a facility for producing qualified=20
fuel until after June 30, 1998.=20
The Service interprets o29(f) and (g) to allow the o29 credit for qualified=20
fuel produced in a facility after its modification only if the modification=20
was placed in service before July 1, 1998, or does not significantly increas=
e=20
the production capacity of the facility or significantly extend the life of=20
the facility. For example, a facility (including one of multiple facilities=20
located at the same site) may be relocated without affecting the availabilit=
y=20
of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and=20
the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly=20
increased at the new location. If, however, the essential components of a=20
single facility are combined after June 30, 1998, with other components that=
=20
were not part of the facility on June 30, 1998, to create multiple facilitie=
s=20
or significantly increase production capacity, the credit will not be allowe=
d=20
for fuel produced at any of those facilities.=20
After reviewing the comments received in response to Rev. Proc. 2000-47 and=20
reconsidering its interpretation of o29(c)(1)(C), the Service has decided=20
that the significant chemical change standard of Rev. Rul. 86-100 is the=20
correct standard. The Service has also decided to resume the issuance of=20
rulings under o29(c)(1)(C), but only in the circumstances described below.=20
The Service is willing to issue rulings that do not go beyond the processes=20
approved in the rulings issued prior to 2000. One procedure common to all of=
=20
those processes (other than processes for the production of coke and similar=
=20
products) is the use of elevated temperature and pressure to produce=20
briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product. The Service is also willin=
g=20
to rule with respect to a process that omits this procedure if the process i=
s=20
otherwise consistent with a process approved in a pre-2000 ruling and the=20
omission of the procedure will not significantly increase the production=20
output of the facility. Accordingly, the Service will issue rulings regardin=
g=20
whether a solid fuel (other than coke) is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C=
)=20
under the circumstances described in section 3 of this revenue procedure.=20
SECTION 3. PROCEDURE=20
The Service will issue rulings that a solid fuel (other than coke) produced=20
from coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C) if the conditions set forth=
=20
below are satisfied and evidence is presented that all, or substantially all=
,=20
of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a significant chemical change. The=20
conditions are that:=20
1. The feedstock coal consists entirely of coal fines or crushed coal=20
comprised of particles no larger than 1/8 inch;=20
2. The feedstock coal is thoroughly mixed in a mixer: (a) with styrene or=20
other monomers following an acid bath, (b) with quinoline (C9H7N) or other=20
organic resin and left to cure for several days, (c) with ultra heavy=20
hydrocarbons, or (d) with an aluminum and/or magnesium silicate binder=20
following heating to a minimum temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit; and=20
3. The treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure=20
that results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product, or the=20
taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not=20
significantly increase the production output of the facility over the=20
remainder of the period during which the o29 credit is allowable.=20
SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE=20
This revenue procedure applies to all ruling requests, including any pending=
=20
in the national office and any submitted after the date of publication of=20
this revenue procedure.=20
SECTION 5. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS=20
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 is revoked.=20
DRAFTING INFORMATION=20
The principal author of this revenue procedure is David McDonnell of the=20
Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries).=20
Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury participated in its development.=20
