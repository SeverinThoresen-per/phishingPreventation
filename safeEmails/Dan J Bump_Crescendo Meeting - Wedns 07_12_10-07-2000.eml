I believe the referenced meeting is still scheduled for Wedns @ 10 am at a=20
location TBD; (i included you on Nick's previous e-mail).

Shonnie was "up to speed" with our discussions in that you are going to=20
prepare a letter for the Crescendo Managing Members that allowed me the=20
capability to proceed with gathering negotiations on Crescendo's behalf.

After that was accepted, you & I were going to prepare a letter to Wildhorse=
=20
alerting them of our acquisition of the Enogex properties (along with the=20
contract), our intentions, and our "assumption" that they would abide by the=
=20
contract.

We can talk more about this last part on Tues. nite &/or Wedns morning.

Thanks.

P.S.  Bierbach and Whitt are delayed until Wedns, therefore its you & I on=20
Tues. nite.  My plan was to take a cab directly to a restaurant of your=20
choice.  I can call you when I arrive at IAH.=20
