Subject: Oct. 17 RRC letter re continuing audit violations

 I just received a letter from Ed Abrahamson at the Railroad Commission,=20
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the=20
audit violations they previously alleged.  I will have delivered to each of=20
you this afternoon a copy of the letter, to which we must respond by October=
=20
27.  The tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff's=20
part, and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved=20
promptly.
 I will be out of town Monday, but I will have my assistant, Monica Jackson,=
=20
set up a meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisf=
y=20
the Commission regarding the remaining exceptions.  In the meantime, please=20
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to b=
e=20
in a position to finalize our response by October 26, Thursday of next week.=
 =20
I think some of the fixes will be fairly easy, but others will be more=20
problematic.  Please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone wh=
o=20
should be aware or involved.
