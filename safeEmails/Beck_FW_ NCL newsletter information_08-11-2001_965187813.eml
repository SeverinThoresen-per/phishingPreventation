The November newsletter looked great! =20

This message was sent by Beverly Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Mon=
day's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation=
 for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will =
try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  Lori=
 also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip =
to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for =
under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation)=
=2E  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that=
