A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system progr=
amming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish =
that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlem=
ent and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point=
 would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming=
 in-place to handle this. =20

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so =
arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mist=
ake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris =
Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to ba=
r mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of =
the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in thei=
r fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers=
 for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a =
2000 case.
