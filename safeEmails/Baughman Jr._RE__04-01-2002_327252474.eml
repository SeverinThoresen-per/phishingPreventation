   Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen
bounding
   around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
   near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
   Thursday.
   A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was
not
   clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
   property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
   ``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday
afternoon,''
   said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also
covers
   suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
   The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons
``are
   deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne,
the
   family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He
will
   be truly missed.''
   Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White
House
   as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House
in
   January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton
