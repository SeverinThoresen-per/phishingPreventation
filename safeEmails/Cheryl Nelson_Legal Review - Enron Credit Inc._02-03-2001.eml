Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with=20
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. =20

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you=20
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit,=20
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as=20
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to=20
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in=20
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground=20
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case,=20
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set=20
aside time to discuss the law on this point.
