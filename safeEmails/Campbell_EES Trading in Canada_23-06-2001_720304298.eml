Gentlemen,
As most of you are aware, Enron's tax department has made recommendations in=
 the past on how trading activities should be conducted to avoid duplicate t=
axation from Revenue Canada and the IRS.  In a nutshell, the recommendations=
 were:

A trader that is a resident of the United States should not trade on behalf =
of Canadian entities such as Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Energy Services Ca=
nada Co. Ltd.;
A trader that is a resident of Canada should not trade on behalf of US entit=
ies such as ENA or EES;
In March 2001 when Dave Pope was an EES Canada employee, the recommendation =
was that Dave confirm all arrangements Houston based EES traders made on beh=
alf of EES Canada.  The intent was that the Houston based trader would make =
the appropriate arrangements without committing EES Canada, then Dave would =
confirm the deal.  As Dave is no longer with EES, I will take on that role w=
ith Rob Milnthorp as my backup.

As stipulated in all Enron contracts, a trade completed on a recorded teleph=
one line is considered a binding agreement, therefore, I suggest that when J=
esus (or his proxy) makes a trade on behalf of EES Canada, he should state i=
n the telephone conversation that the trade will be confirmed by EES Canada =
personnel.  Jesus, you can email me the details and I will confirm the trade=
 - you should still fill out all paperwork.   In the future near future, EES=
 Canada will be self sufficient and Canadian based traders will take on Jesu=
s' role. =20

I have spoken to John McKay about western Canada and will speak with Marin C=
uilla about eastern Canada to make sure we are all on the same page.  (Marti=
n, could you reply to this email or call me at 403-974-6789 when you have a =
break from your trading?)  =20

Mike and Ryan, please give me a shout if you have issues or concerns.  Thank=
s.
