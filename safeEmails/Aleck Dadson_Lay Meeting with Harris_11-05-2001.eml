been overcome.   The Premier's Office has proposed the afternoon of =20
Thursday, June 7 for 30-45 minutes  to be scheduled between the hours of 2pm=

and  4pm.    In my view, there is still considerable value in proceeding wit=

this meeting  and hopefully Ken Lay could be available.   I would suggest=20
that we propose the meeting to commence  in the 3:15 - 3:30pm timeframe,  to=
