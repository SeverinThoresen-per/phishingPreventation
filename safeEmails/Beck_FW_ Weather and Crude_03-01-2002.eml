There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not=
 been picked up on the Netco list. =20

Two of the three are Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - details below in my e-mai=
l to Louise. =20

Another excellent player is Shona Wilson.  She currently leads the group tha=
t produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC befor=
e joining Enron, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts=
 on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the busine=
ss.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with a=
nother entity. =20

I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netc=
o.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about=
 these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best t=
eam for Netco.  --Sally=20

The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at =
your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that N=
etco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has as=
sembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude opera=
tions experience. =20

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sween=
ey - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive ri=
sk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading o=
perations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each =
are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the =
details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weath=
er.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily =
activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had ext=
ensive experience in gas risk management.  =20

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The=
 bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was =
part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has e=
xperience in the UK as well. =20

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kev=
in would both be great players to have on the Netco team. =20

Let's discuss.  --Sally=20
