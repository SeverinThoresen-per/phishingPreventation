It was a billing error. We didn't bill them for enough back in early 2000 an=
d=20
then too much in Dec.  I don't think you need to worry about it unless they=20
mention it to you.  If so, try to blame me and have them call me to explain.

I am assuming this is ok.  Why would they be invoiced for Feb - April now? =20
Was this an error?

Have they called you with any questions and should I get back with them?

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  =
I=20
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for=20
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January=
=20
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA=
=20
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for=20
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give the=
m=20
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel


PS I promise this is it.
