I'd like a copy of that, if possible.

I think it should state:  Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclose=
d to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department.  If possible, =
put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook. =20

As soon as we receive notice to move ahead, generalists will receive a train=
ing binder outlining the process of the WARN notifications.  I assume we nee=
d to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any spe=
cific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on=
 each page?  Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents.

Thanks - Tana =20
