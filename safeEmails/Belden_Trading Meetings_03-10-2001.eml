This e-mail is to confirm what we discussed and decided at today's trading m=
eeting.  Going forward, we are splitting the fundies meeting into two parts.=
  The first part will be from about 1 until 1:30 with Tim H. reviewing all o=
f the routine fundamental slides.  The second part of the meeting will inclu=
de only the people on this e-mail.  During that part of the meeting, which w=
ill run from approximately 1:30 until 2:30, we will discuss specific trading=
 matters.

If there is anyone who works for you that has been going to the fundies meet=
ing but will not be attending the smaller trading meeting please let them kn=
ow about the new approach.  We remain committed to sharing the fundies infor=
mation with a broad group people while trying to create a time and place whe=
re the smaller trading team can talk through trading issues.

Thanks,
Tim
