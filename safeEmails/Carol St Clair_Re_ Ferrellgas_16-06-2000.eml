It would help if in whatever you send to her today that Enron preserves its=20

 taht we have with them and that by cancelling the margin call we in no way=20
waive our right to make future calls.

I called Ferrellgas for Margin yesterday, 6/15, for COB 6/14.  However,=20
today's MTM is under the threshold, thus no longer resulting in the need for=
=20
Margin.  I spoke with Erin Hamilton at Ferrellgas and she requested=20
confirmation, using today's MTM, that the previous Margin call should be=20
cancelled.  Should there be any specific language used in a cancellation=20
confirmation about reserving the right to call for Margin in the future, eve=
n=20
though we will cancel the Margin call for COB 6/14?  Please let me know your=
=20
thoughts.

Thank you,
