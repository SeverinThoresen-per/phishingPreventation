I've asked around and I think going to Banff to play some golf sight see is =
a great thing=20
to do.  Here is a link for some of the courses in the region.  I'm worried a=
bout getting tee
times, so I'd like to plan things out as soon as possible.  I was thinking o=
f spending a night
or two in Banff.

There are a couple of very good courses in Calgary we can play as well - plu=
s general sight seeing.

let me know what you think

love,
coop

Coop:  Bought tickets, only change is that we're leaving here at the crack
of dawn, will arrive about noon on Friday.  Still leave 4th.  I think some
golf would be good, esp if you play, too.  Perhaps your IT friend could
suggest some courses.  Of course he's welcome, too, if he'd like.  It's
probably better if we don't have to change hotels much, unless we want to
spend a day or 2 in Banff.  Maybe we can discuss this weekend.  We don't
need 5 stars but, if it's possible to stay at a place that has a course
affiliation, that could be good.  Maybe you could check out the
possibilities.  Are you in Portland or Canada?  Luv, Mom

Great!

I'll start planning things here.  What do you want to do about
accomodations?  Would
you guys like to make it a golfing vacation?

love,
