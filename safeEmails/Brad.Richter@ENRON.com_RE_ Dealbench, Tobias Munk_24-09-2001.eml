OK-- level set.  The tone of my message was not meant to be confrontational.=
  I had a number of meetings with Tobias to discuss his plans, which as of T=
hursday had not panned out.  I simply wanted to make sure that Ross and I we=
re getting the latest news from ENA especially if you were considering using=
 the platform in any longer-term manner, which is new information.  Don has =
been one of our biggest supporters, and I certainly want to make sure he get=
s some input on the direction of DealBench.  I just didn't want it to go thr=
ough Tobias first.
=20
Sorry for the confusion,
Brad

Sorry this is getting a bit messed up.  As I said on Friday, Tobias came to =
see me to say goodbye and sated that he may consider buying DealBanch if he =
can raise the money (this would obviously be great for ENW).  I told hiim we=
 (ENA) would be a customer of DealBench (as we intend to continue using it n=
ext year or find another method).  I intorduced Don and Tobias and said that=
 we could give him some sort of contract if he were to pitch a DealBench buy=
out..  As you all know he only left Friday and has had no discussions with a=
nyone and this is purely conceptual, my guess is he gets another energy trad=
ing job in Europe.
=20
I only forwarded the note to you for information post our Friday discussion =
to ensure you were happy with us replying and what you wanted us to say.  Th=
e response to Don is somewhat inappropriate as it wasn't Tobias contacting D=
on out of the blue but following the conversation I relayed to Greg.
=20
Let us know whether you are happy for ENA to agree to a contract or not  sho=
uld he ever buy it from you - its that simple and a really long shot.  As di=
scussed on Friday, ENA will not support DealBench on an allocated basis, the=
 economics of being the only customer simply do not work.  If we continue on=
 the same charging basis with perhaps a minimum that's fine.
=20
No idea how we got down this path.

Has Tobias shown us who is backing him and how much money he can get?  We st=

Thanks.

Since Tobias Munk is no longer an employee of Enron as of last week, please =
direct all correspondance concerning DealBench to either me or Ross Mesquita=
=2E  We will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropria=
te time.  As you know, we are currently formulating our plans for the platfo=
rm and we would appreciate any input you have to that end.  If you have any =
questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thanks in advance for your h=

Hi Don,=20

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me=
 to raise VC money I need to show client business.

If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is loo=
king to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a s=
ubstantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the pr=
ocess. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific =
or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail=20

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com=20

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successf=
ul divestitures :-)=20

Tobias Munk=20
