	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Marine=
r's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner fo=
r the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  The=
resa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she ha=
s a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to han=
dle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting y=
ou about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has giv=
en me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based =
on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as=
 recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a =
law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate cli=
ent solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse =
to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask fo=
r a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J =
would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsi=
diaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned =
on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matte=
rs, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not =
specific, I believe F&J lists it as the "Method and System for the Determina=
tion of VAR").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matter=
s in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that i=
f dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by =
Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our cons=
ideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this =
matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week=
, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, t=
hat we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt
