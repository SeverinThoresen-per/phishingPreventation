Kristian,

	I met with Tim today to inform him of my intentions to pursue opportunities=
 outside of the Portland office. It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying=
 that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure an=
d state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, a=
nd therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the eco=
nomy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me i=
nto something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to =
go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentio=
ns. What do I do now to start truly pursuing a job in the London office? =20




								Chris
