Guys:  We want to change the curve mappings for KERN/LasVegas from SOCAL to =
PG&E/Topock.  However, there are a few term deals that will be affected when=
 we make the change.

Jason:  I tried to look at the deals to tell you more about them, but we do =
not have access to Canadian deals.  Can you check with the Canadian trader o=
n these three deals to see if we can change the curves ?

452375
459155
434877

Brain:  Can you also have some one run this down from your end.

Thanks

Anne,

Perhaps, but there are three deals out there with October and forward activi=
ty. The deals however; are done by Petro-Canada - BC and
Petro-Canada Hydrocarbons - BC. The deal numbers are 452375, 459155, and 434=
877.
Let me know what you decide.
