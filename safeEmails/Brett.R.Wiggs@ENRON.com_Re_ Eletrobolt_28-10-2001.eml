John:

We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving u=
s a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have =
said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.

With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expend=
itures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.

I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and wha=
t the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently f=
unded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The Wes=
tLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  =
The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehic=
le.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the =
take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicat=
ing the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We =
hope to have another next week.

There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB =
did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with Wes=
tLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start =
date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the =
grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire ve=
hicle prior to the OPIC funding.  Depending upon the timing, this could repr=
esent a cash flow of up to $280 million for a short period of time.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

Brett

did we sell the power to the government?

What is our cash burn on the project right now and over the next month?
