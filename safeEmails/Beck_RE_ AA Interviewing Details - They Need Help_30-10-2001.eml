Will do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heav=
ily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst can=
didates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that w=
e have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Frida=
y interviews for Analysts. =20

Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make=
 sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and Decem=
ber 1 Super Saturdays. =20

What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --Sally=20
