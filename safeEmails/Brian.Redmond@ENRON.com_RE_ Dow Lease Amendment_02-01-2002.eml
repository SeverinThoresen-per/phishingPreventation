The agreement looks good from our angle - send it and lets see what Dow thin=
ks.

UPDATE:=20

I received a call from Gulf South who says that they have completed their de=
al with Dow to lease caverns #13 and #14, subject to receiving FERC permits.=
  So, Dow should be willing to let us extend the lease because they will be =
giving up significant value if we start withdrawing gas.  Gulf South can't b=
uy the gas from us now, because they do not have the proper FERC permits.  W=
e may, however, be able get them to pony up for the lease payment extension =
(in exchange for us not pulling the gas out of the ground).

Alternatively, Bridgeline is willing to step into our shoes and purchase the=
 gas from us for resale to Gulf South (once GS get their permits) as long as=
 Gulf South provides Bridgeline with a firm purchase commitment at some date=
 in the future (independent of the FERC permitting condition precedent).

Regards,
Brian
