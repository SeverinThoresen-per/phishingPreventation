Hi Lydia,

Just to keep you in the loop, apparently Andy will not be in London for this=
 meeting we spoke about yesterday.  We will however, be including him via vi=
deo conference.  Due to the time difference we have moved the meeting till 5=
pm (London time) on the 8th June to accommodate Andy's participation.  Would=
 you be able to book a VC room for him please, and advise which room he will=
 be situated in.  The meeting will be 2 hours maximum in duration.

Many thanks
Suzanne
