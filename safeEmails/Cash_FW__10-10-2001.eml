Carol,

I have a straight up deal with a consultant to work for me full time at $750=
0/month plus approved expenses.  His scope of work is identical to Eric Raab=
's plus add "focus on developing the OTC market and wholesale carrier relati=
onships that result in increasing the number of transactions and volume of t=
raffic, particularly with buyers".  He will also focus on building direct ro=
utes, our VOIP strategy and other trading oriented transactions.

He will report to me.  It is month to month, 15 days notice to terminate con=
tract.

I'd like someone to prepare a draft of this so I can review and then forward=
 it to Mr. Omar Valdez for his review.  =20

Thank you.
