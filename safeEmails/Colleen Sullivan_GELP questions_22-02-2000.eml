I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract.  First, in the=20
agreement's Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed=
=20
that GELP has (or had) in place with various counterparties.  I'm wondering=20
what the status of these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in=
=20
place, etc.  These agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
 Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that=20
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
 Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
 Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
 Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
 CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get ga=
s=20
to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
 Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
  Note:  According to the billing calculations, it appears that the Duke=20
supply arrangement must have some=20
   FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
 Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is=20
used?  If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter=20
information from a Bristol RTU.  How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value=20
proposition in this agreement?  I understand that there is a $5000 fee you=20
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities. =20
Since the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries=20
in the "winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional=20
compensation), there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.   Are ther=
e=20
other values you see to this deal that we may be missing? =20

Thanks for your assistance.
