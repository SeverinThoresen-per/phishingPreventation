OATI Security Officers and Digital Certificate Users,

June 30th and the end of Tradewave is coming up fast.  OATI would like to
remind OATI Digital Certificates users that the following OASIS Systems will
accept OATI Digital Certificates for secure access:
=20
* MAIN OASIS 		* MAPP OASIS=20
* MISO OASIS		* NEPOOL OASIS=20
* New Brunswick Power OASIS=20
* Northwest OASIS	* Rocky Mountain OASIS=20
* SWPP OASIS 	* VACAR OASIS=09

If you would like to use your OATI Digital Certificates to access the AEP,
ECAR, and EES OASIS Systems, please contact the appropriate OASIS
Administrator at each site to discuss the acceptance of OATI Digital
Certificates. The most effective way to persuade an OASIS Node Administrator
is for the customers to contact them and express their support for OATI
Digital Certificates. For a list of OASIS Nodes and contacts, please visit
the following URL: <http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/nodeacc.html>=20

To register your OATI Digital Certificates with an OASIS Node, please have
your OATI Security Officer contact the appropriate OASIS Nodes for more
information about each nodes registration procedure and to provide all
necessary information to the OASIS Administrator.  To view a node providers
homepage and their posted registration instructions, please use the
following URL to link to the appropriate region:

If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free
to contact me.
