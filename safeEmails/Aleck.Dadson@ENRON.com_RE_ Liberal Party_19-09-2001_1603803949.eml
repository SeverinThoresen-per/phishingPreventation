That is what I was coming to myself - the way we sell this to the Conservati=
ves is by saying that we would do the same for them - what is key is buildin=
g bipartisan support - the Conservatives should welcome this because it prot=
ects them from Liberal attack re: a) the market opening policy initiative, a=
nd b) ties (via contributions, fundraising, etc) to big energy. But I also k=
now that some one like Wilson  can be particularly vindictive and may not re=
spond well.  Will review with today with Sasha, who sits on the Tories' fund=
raising committee.=20

As you know, one of our key efforts in Ontario is to build bipartisan suppor=
t for opening the market in early 2002. That largely involves firming up the=
 position of the Liberal Party (currently in opposition but in a strong posi=
tion to win in the next election) in support of moving forward with competit=
ion. The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like Rob M=
ilnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund raisin=
g event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for the Ind=
ependent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest annual e=
nergy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the Ontario e=
nergy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the event.  I didn=
't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)  through s=
uch an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving forward.  (In=
 other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to state that R=
ob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the bipartisan support fo=
r the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support is good for th=
e Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so would not alienate t=
he governing Conservatives. (The Conservatives have always encouraged us to =
do what we can to keep the Liberals on side and I think they would be sophis=
ticated enough to appreciate that efforts would involve participation in suc=
h fund raising events - particularly if the material used did not endorse th=
e Liberals and merely recognized their support for moving forward). Let me k=
now what you think.  Aleck (having said all this I should admit to being a L=
iberal)
