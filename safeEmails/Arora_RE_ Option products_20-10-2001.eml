I am glad you liked the presentation.

I had a look at the tool-kit - I think it is a good brief description of var=
ious products.  I did forward your email to Iris Mack and she might be able =
to provide you further input on that. She is also available as a resource (a=
s a derivatives specialist) to analyze clients risk and provide solutions.

I would be more than happy to discuss any specific client situations you hav=
e and what we could offer to them. Would be happy to sit down and discuss mo=
re stuff with you if you are interested.


Harry

Hi Harry,

I heard you speak yesterday at the originator's meeting.  It was rather inte=
resting.  I took the Derivatives 2 course a few weeks ago and they went into=
 the complexities of options trading.  It was cool stuff.  I'd like to know =
more about options trading and I hope that you can recommend some good sourc=
es or books.  I'd appreciate any info you could pass on. =20

Also, I'm putting together an "Originator's Toolkit" which consists of the v=
arious financial products that the originators and mid marketers could offer=
 to customers.  I'm attaching a list of option based products that I have pu=
t together so far.  I'd be grateful if you could take a minute, read through=
 it, and let me know if there are any additional option products that I shou=
ld include.  I want to make sure the toolkit has as many useful products as =
possible.

Thanks so much,
Max
