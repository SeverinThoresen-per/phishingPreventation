Hi Jaideep!

My first suggestion is that you come to Houston as scheduled (and arranged=20
with Wharton nearly 3 weeks ago).  Alternatively, rely on your Tiger=20
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project.  Should=
=20
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip, please return th=
e=20
ticket issued to you.  Should it make sense for you to visit Enron some time=
=20
in the future, we can discuss arrangements at that time.

Hope to see you soon!

--Christie.

Hello Christie,

Thank you for organizing the Wharton trip to Enron.  Unfortunately, the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as I'll have to miss over
4 hours of classes, which I cannot afford to do.  I tried changing the time
with Continental and there latest flight leaves at 6PM - which does not work
for me (smack in the middle of my 3 hour class)

Thus the dilemma that I find myself in is the following:

a. Try a different flight as I can make any flight after 7:30PM (however, I
have no control over reservations/budget etc)
b. As it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year, use this ticket to come
some other time

Sorry for this but I just saw the  bookings today.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jaideep
