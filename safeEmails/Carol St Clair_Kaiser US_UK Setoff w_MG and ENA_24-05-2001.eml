Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical=
=20
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap=20
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser=20
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant=20
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International=20
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING=
=20
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?=
 =20
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with=20
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward=20
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off=20
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need=20
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as=20
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak abou=
t=20
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts. =20
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter=
=20
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable,=
=20
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a Jun=
e=20
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy
