Louise,

A couple of weeks ago we bought an option on four more LM6000's for a Jan02 =
delivery.  The intent was to sell our 4 July01 machines and recognize approx=
imately $5MM for this "time swap".  We believe that we are in a position to =
execute this swap (Delta Power is at the table), but during the past two wee=
ks we have received very strong tolling bids (Merrill Lynch, Duke, Constella=
tion) for the LV project that imply a $20MM value to the project but require=
 a commercial operation date of Sep02.  COD of Sep02 requires early turbine =
delivery.  We are therefore leaning towards canceling the turbine sale/repur=
chase in order to go for the bigger prize.  It will require finalizing devel=
opment, EPC contract, tolling agreement, finance plan and internal approvals=
 by May 1.  I am recommending that we go for it.  If we are not able to pull=
 it off, I am confident that the high bids for these machines will still be =
there. =20

Chris
