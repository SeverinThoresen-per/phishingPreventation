Gerald,

Looks good to me.  In the signature block, should it be Enron Compression Se=
rvices Company as opposed to Enron Compression Company?  The information tha=
t I have on the ROW tracts is not specifically descriptive other than to des=
cribe them as tracts owned by 1) Herbert and Margaret Lane Property, 2) Alan=
 and Elizabeth English Property and 3) Kay Arnold Fritz Property all in disp=
ute along the Shaky Joe Swamp Transmission Line.  The attorney representing =
these people is Brigham Moore LLP and the representing attorney appears to b=
e Andrew Prince Brigham.  Hopefully, this is good enough.  If you need to ta=
lk to me, call me at 701-683-4683 or leave me a voice mail at 3-7350.   When=
 you have a draft of the Construction Cost Overage letter, please send it to=
 me.  Thanks again for all your help and hard work.

Thanks,
Chris Hilgert
