Do you have any thoughts on Point #2?  Do you care if we limit the cross=20
default provisions to just the Credit Support Providers and not both the=20
Credit Support providers and the counterparties?

Carol -

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.
