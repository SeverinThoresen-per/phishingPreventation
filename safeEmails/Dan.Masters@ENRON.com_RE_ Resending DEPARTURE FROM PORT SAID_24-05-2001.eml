Dear Sir;
Forgot to include the FO-consumption in my previous msg. It is
included now.Based on 0.22% BOG.

Dear Sir;
Have service men onboard which will be sent ashore in Algeciras,
Spain where we also will be taking some store and provision. I
estimate the time for this to approx 12 hours.
Taking this into consideration, I have the following answer to your
questions below:

1) Full charter speed 17.5 kn: 7th June 0600 LT
2) Same as above, 17.5 knots (47.5 mt/day=3DTOTAL 760 mt)
3) 16.2 knots (30 mt/day=3DTOTAL 519 mt)
4) 14.9 knots (14 mt/day=3DTOTAL 263.2 mt)

Capt. Bentzrod-
Hope all is well for you.  Please provide the following information
at your
earliest convenience:
1) ETA to Lake Charles if ship were to proceede at full speed for the
remainder of the trip.
2) What average speed would be necessary to arrive at Lake Charles
buoy at
06:00 on June 7.
3) What average speed would be necessary to arrive at Lake Charles
buoy at
06:00 on June 8.
4) What average speed would be necessary to arrive at Lake Charles
buoy at
06:00 on June 9.

For each of the above scenarios, also please include an estimate of
the
amount of fuel oil that would be used.

Thank you,
Dan Masters
