I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedr=
oom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a compa=
ny in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your=
 stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you sta=
ted that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would=
 like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stan=
ds.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received =
a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price cl=
ose to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture=
 from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager =
of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the fu=
rniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-=
7163. =20
