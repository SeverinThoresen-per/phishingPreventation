Hey!  The curtains look good--I hope they do when they are hung-- Lacy & I
are planning to come next Friday the 18th. when ya'll go to the rodeo.  I'm
taking a personal day from the bus and leaving early. Thought I would bring
them. Answer & let me know if that's ok.  If you need them before then I'll
try to get them mailed.  Hope sweet Cole is feeling better over his cold.
Love you, Mom
