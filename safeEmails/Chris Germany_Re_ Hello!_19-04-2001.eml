Subject: Hello!

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very=20

Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton. =20
They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day. =20
Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan
