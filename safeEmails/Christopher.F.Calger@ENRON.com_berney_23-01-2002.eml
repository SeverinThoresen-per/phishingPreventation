I spoke with berney this AM.  As you mentioned, I believe he needs some more=
 $ (a risk premium in his words).  I told him that the intent is not to simp=
ly be a block-trading spec shop, but we do have a genuine interest in struct=
ured customer deals.  Also, the size of his group is irrelevant because the =
marketers will be asked to structure on their own and I will want Berney to =
have some oversight to ensure quality and consistency, as well as helping ou=
t on all of the big deals. =20
