Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron Industri=
al Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and Elizabeth Hutc=
hinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works. Right=
 now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX index and th=
e methodology behind it. I have seen one of the presentations that you have =
presented in the States a while ago but I am looking for a little bit more d=
etail. For example, what kind of companies you contact, what percentage of i=
ndustry they represent in terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, wha=
t geographic area these companies represent and anything else that you think=
 its important to know.=20

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli
