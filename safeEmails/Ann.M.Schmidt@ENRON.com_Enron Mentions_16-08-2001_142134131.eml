Jeff Skilling loved helping to build Enron into the US energy powerhouse it =
is today. He just did not want to run it.=20
After six months as chief executive, Mr Skilling abruptly resigned on Tuesda=
y evening, shocking financial markets, the analysts who had tracked his 11-y=
ear rise to the top - even the man who hired him.=20
"I certainly didn't expect it," Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, said in an inte=
rview. "I knew he had a lot going on. He was thinking about a lot of things.=
" But Mr Lay declined to elaborate: "It was based upon personal and family m=
atters. He prefers to keep that private."=20
Mr Skilling simply cited "personal reasons" in his farewell conference with =
analysts. He will not get a severance package and has agreed to adhere to hi=
s contract, and will not compete with the company until the end of 2003. His=
 Houston office said he left town yesterday without leaving any more details=
, so setting the rumour mill in motion.=20
Some suspect he suffered from executive burn-out. Others say he was frustrat=
ed with an inability to convince investors he would guide the company around=
 roadblocks thrown up in California, India and in its broadband operations. =
And there were those who accused him of having adopted a domineering approac=
h that turned off many who dealt with the company.=20
But someone who has known Mr Skilling for many years says the 47-year-old di=
d not like the "crushing responsibility" of being at the top. Most of his fr=
iends are at Enron. He loved helping drive the company's tremendous expansio=
n. Yet he could not retreat back down the ranks within the company without l=
osing his standing. So he left.=20
Mr Lay will assume both of Mr Skilling's positions and stay on until the end=
 of 2005 to establish a new line of succession. He served as chief executive=
 from 1985 until Mr Skilling's election in February.=20
Indeed, analysts and even Mr Lay admit he never really let go of the strings=
=2E And so Mr Skilling's departure will not be a turning point for Enron.=20
"There will not be any significant change," Mr Lay said. "We have worked joi=
ntly on all of the strategies, all of the organisation, all of the people."=20
Mr Lay is the one widely credited with transforming Enron from a regional na=
tural gas pipeline company to a leading electricity, natural gas and communi=
cations company. During his 15 years as chief executive, the company's marke=
t capitalisation increased from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 70bn. Revenues reache=
d Dollars 101bn in 2000.=20
But its share price has not done as well, falling 58 per cent since its peak=
 of Dollars 90 in August last year. Enron is one of several energy traders f=
acing questions in California over alleged manipulation of prices - which it=
 denies.=20
It is trying to sell out of India, where the company is embroiled in a legal=
 battle with a state electricity board. And its broadband operations have be=
en performing poorly.=20
"Despite continued solid earnings growth from the ongoing expansion of its d=
ominant position in the worldwide energy markets, the company has been plagu=
ed with a series of negative issues while its overall quality of earnings ha=
s deteriorated, its level of behind-the-scenes financial engineering has inc=
reased and its overall standing with the Street has plunged," says Ronald Ba=
rone of UBS Warburg.=20
"Mr Skilling was a core force in the evolution of Enron over the past decade=
, and the recent turn of events cannot all be placed on his watch."=20
That said, Mr Barone believes the company will be undaunted by Mr Skilling's=
 departure: "I cannot think of a more capable person to put in charge of thi=
s company than Ken Lay."=20

COMMENT & ANALYSIS: Enron goes back to the future: Andrew Hill and Sheila Mc=
Nulty examine the background to Jeff Skilling's premature exit:=20
Financial Times; Aug 16, 2001
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY

Jeff Skilling receiveda cream pie in the face when he went to San Francisco =
in June to address a meeting.=20
But protests by disgruntled Californian electricity consumers have been the =
least of the Enron's chief executive's worries since he took over the top op=
erational job at the US gas-pipeline-turned-energy-trading- company in Febru=
ary.=20
In the past six months there have been accusations that Enron manipulated po=
wer prices in California; legal battles in India over its attempt to pull ou=
t of a project near Bombay; and a halving of its share price from last year'=
s peak of Dollars 90.=20
On Tuesday came the surprise announcement that Mr Skilling would step down a=
s chief executive and president for personal reasons, to be replaced by Kenn=
eth Lay, Enron's chairman and Mr Skilling's predecessor as chief executive.=20
Mr Skilling told analysts that his resignation had nothing to do with Enron.=
 Mr Lay said there were "no accounting issue, no trading issue, no reserve i=
ssue, no previously unknown problem issues".=20
Whatever the reason for his premature exit, it has drawn attention to the sa=
vage reassessment of companies from beyond the technology sector that had be=
nefited from the promise of rapid growth in tech-related areas.=20
In the analyst jargon of the moment, Enron has joined a group of aggressive =
companies that are being punished for "getting ahead of the curve".=20
Enron is no dotcom one-hit wonder. Its net income rose 40 per cent in the se=
cond quarter of this year and revenue more than trebled to Dollars 50bn (Pou=
nds 35bn) as its core energy-trading business prospered.=20
But under Mr Lay and Mr Skilling, who was chief operating officer until he t=
ook on the chief executive role, the group made a bold bet on the future of =
trading in a range of commodities beyond energy.=20
Interviewed last October, when Enron's shares were still trading within sigh=
t of their Dollars 90 peak, Mr Skilling picked data storage, logistics and c=
redit instruments that support business-to-business e-commerce as three area=
s in which Enron believed it could make a market.=20
"The total value of the market that we are looking at, outside of energy or =
bandwidth, is equivalent to the worldwide market in electricity," he said.=20
With the benefit of hindsight, it seems that Enron was guilty of plotting a =
rosy future on the basis of exceptional 1999-2000 growth in some technology =
sectors. Companies directly involved in data storage and B2B e-commerce have=
 been among the hardest hit this year, as the rest of the corporate sector h=
as cut back on information technology spending. Enron has also been punished=
 for its commitment to bandwidth trading, as forecasts of a rapid expansion =
of broadband telecommunications have proved over-optimistic. Instead, the di=
vision lost Dollars 102m in the second quarter and the company has had to sc=
ale back its ambitions.=20
Enron was not alone, even if it was among the most aggressive in its attempt=
 to pioneer new markets. In the technology sector, Cisco Systems has acknowl=
edged that it expected demand for its products to continue at the same pace =
as last year. When demand fell, it was left with useless inventory. Outside =
the pure technology companies, Charles Schwab appears to have overshot by co=
mmitting too many resources to online broking and Eastman Kodak has admitted=
 it originally overestimated demand for digital photographic products.=20
All these companies were encouraged by armies of market analysts and consult=
ants, some of whom earlier lauded their efforts radically to change their st=
ructure for a new era in which physical assets would count less than an abil=
ity to exploit intellectual capital.=20
Ambitious executives may also bear part of the blame for disappointment. "Pa=
rt of what happens in these companies that perform in superior ways is that =
the senior executives lead them with the expectation that they are going to =
achieve that performance again, without fully understanding how they are goi=
ng to do it," says Chuck Lucier, senior vice-president with consultancy Booz=
-Allen & Hamilton. "It's like working on a high wire without a net."=20
With the outlook for the US and global economies still uncertain, investors =
now prefer a more cautious approach. Enron's decision to reappoint Mr Lay fi=
ts into a pattern in which once high-flying companies, such as Xerox and Luc=
ent Technologies of the US and Marconi of the UK have - at least temporarily=
 - restored a trusted old hand to the top job, partly to reassure shareholde=
rs.=20
The Enron case is slightly different, because it was Mr Lay who led the comp=
any through its strong growth phase, although Mr Skilling was a fundamental =
part of the strategy and increasingly the frontman for the company even befo=
re he took over as chief executive. "Jeff personified Enron; he was Enron pr=
obably to a greater extent than Jack Welch is General Electric," says one an=
alyst.=20
Mr Lay yesterday acknow-ledged that Enron share-holders had benefited from t=
he hefty premium awarded to growth stocks in 1999 and 2000 and suffered with=
 the same group in the first half of this year. It used to be "fun to be one=
 of those", he said, but "in the last six months there was a sell-off in the=
 market of growth companies and high p/e companies".=20
Admiration for Enron went beyond the trading floors and research departments=
 of Wall Street. As recently as a year ago, top financial executives admitte=
d privately to envy of the former pipeline company's elevated stock rating a=
nd to frustration that their more traditional employers would not support pi=
oneering experiments in new markets.=20
The last year has seen a more sober assessment of those prospects, even thou=
gh many analysts still believe Enron's push into different areas will be rew=
arded. Mr Lay repeated yesterday that he believed the company was fundamenta=
lly strong.=20
The irony is that having been punished by the markets as the technology sect=
or declined, Enron may not benefit if the economic cycle turns because it is=
 now associated with its peers in the energy sector. As one analyst put it y=
esterday: "You don't buy energy stocks at the beginning of a new cycle - you=
 buy tech stocks."=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Enron chief takes back key positions ENERG=
Y LAY VOWS THAT NOTHING WILL CHANGE AFTER SURPRISE DEPARTURE OF SKILLING:=20
Financial Times; Aug 16, 2001
By Sheila McNulty in Houston

Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, yesterday reassumed the positions of chief exec=
utive officer and president of the Texas energy giant following the surprise=
 departure of Jeff Skilling. He vowed nothing would change.=20
"We don't need to change things. The company is doing well. The business is =
sound," Mr Lay said in an interview.=20
Enron reported a 32 per cent increase in diluted earnings per share to 45 ce=
nts for the second quarter of 2001; a 40 per cent increase in net income to =
Dollars 404m; a 58 per cent increase in energy volumes delivered; and an 89 =
per cent increase in new retail energy services contracts to Dollars 7.2bn.=20
However, its share price has plunged 58 per cent since its peak late last ye=
ar on high-profile problems in California, India and in its broadband busine=
sses.=20
Yesterday the shares fell 10 per cent to Dollars 38.57.=20
Mr Lay says Mr Skilling's departure has nothing to do with those problems.=20
Mr Skilling took the helm from him only in February, Mr Lay says.=20
Not only does he readily admit they moved into all those problem areas toget=
her, but he indicates none of them is of a magnitude to put the company at r=
isk.=20
Instead, he believes Enron has fallen victim to the widespread sell-off in g=
rowth companies and a misconception in financial markets that its recent foc=
us on energy trading means it has no underlying fundamentals.=20
"We are not a trading company. We're basically a logistics company, an energ=
y services company," he said.=20
"We have not done a very good job of explaining that for quite a while."=20
He added: "Maybe we can do better at segmenting the businesses to give analy=
sts a better sense of respective segments."=20
Enron has undergone dramatic growth as Mr Lay transformed the company from a=
 regional natural gas pipeline concern into a global energy powerhouse in ju=
st over a dozen years.=20
The company now markets electricity and natural gas; delivers physical commo=
dities and financial and risk management services worldwide; and has develop=
ed its own platform through which it facilitates online business.=20
Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Service, notes that Enron continues to o=
btain significant new business and believes even its troubled broadband unit=
 offers potential in a market with expectations of exponential demand over t=
he long-term.=20
He characterises the recent problems as growing pains.=20
Nevertheless, analysts agree Enron has strong fundamentals at its core.=20
Ronald Barone, of UBS Warburg, said investors are overreacting to Mr Skillin=
g's departure.=20
"This company is being put back into the hands of the architect," he said.=20

Enron CEO's Departure Not Passing the Smell Test
By Christopher Edmonds  <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>
TheStreet.com
8/15/01 6:25 PM ET=20

Speculation's swirling around Jeff Skilling's abrupt departure from energy g=
iant Enron (ENE <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=3DENE>:=
NYSE) on Tuesday, </funds/chrisedmonds/1518235.html> for what he would only =
say were "personal reasons." While Enron's stock performance since Skilling =
ascended to the CEO spot in February has left shareholders wanting, his depa=
rture is being assailed by many as both selfish and riddling.=20
Skilling left behind a trove of potential financial gains, making the timing=
 of his move puzzling.=20
"I'm quite confused by the whole thing," says Tom McIntyre, president of Des=
sauer McIntyre Asset Management and an Enron shareholder. "After a difficult=
 few months, all of a sudden the CEO quits. This just isn't passing the smel=
l test."=20
Other investors spoke with their feet. Enron shares traded down as much as 1=
4% early Wednesday before closing at $40.25, down $2.68 or 6.2%=20
"I reject the notion that this is a very good time to leave," says McIntyre.=
 "That is a very selfish interpretation of the current situation. People of =
Skilling's stature take on a responsibility and they cannot walk away withou=
t considering the impact such a decision can have on shareholders."=20
The $22 Million Question
While both Skilling and Enron Chairman Ken Lay, former -- and now current --=
 president and CEO, maintain that Skilling left for personal reasons and of =
his own volition, the shroud of secrecy over the specifics is troubling to b=
oth investors and pundits -- including my colleague James J. Cramer. </rmone=
y/jamesjcramer/1518948.html>=20
On a company conference call Tuesday evening, Skilling said he "wished to ke=
ep the personal reasons private." Sources at Enron would not elaborate, but =
insisted that Skilling, 47, did not resign for health reasons.=20
On the conference call, Lay confirmed that Skilling would not receive severa=
nce pay, as his resignation was "voluntary." Had Skilling been canned, the s=
everance package would have been hefty. According to Enron's 2000 Proxy Stat=
ement: "In the event of involuntary termination prior to the expiration of t=
he term, Mr. Skilling will receive a lump sum payment for each full calendar=
 year of the remaining term of the agreement equal to base salary, performan=
ce bonus and long-term grant value received in calendar year 2000, offset ag=
ainst amounts payable under the severance plan maintained by Enron, as well =
as full vesting of all outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards=
=2E"=20
Hence the $20 million question with a $2 million kicker.=20
In 2000, Skilling was paid a base salary of $850,000 and a bonus of $5.6 mil=
lion, and received restricted stock awards valued at $3.5 million as well as=
 867,880 options to purchase Enron stock. With a contract expiring in 2002, =
Skilling would have been eligible to receive a single severance payment of a=
t least $19.9 million, not including the value of the options received in 20=
00. Also, the nonvested portion of the 2.4 million stock options he currentl=
y owns immediately would become vested, had he been forced out.=20
Leaving voluntarily, Skilling would have collected a cool $2 million if he'd=
 hung around for another four months.=20
That's because, according to the 2000 proxy, Enron loaned $4 million to Skil=
ling in 1997. Skilling repaid $2 million in 1999 and his employment contract=
 calls for the balance of the loan to be forgiven "if Mr. Skilling fulfills =
all the duties and responsibilities under his employment agreement through D=
ec. 31, 2001 or is involuntarily terminated prior to Dec. 31, 2001."=20
So if the Enron ship is on course, Skilling isn't ill and timing really wasn=
't an issue, why wouldn't he either wait until December to resign or announc=
e his resignation but make it effective Dec. 31 and collect the extra $2 mil=
lion?=20
"Gee, only four months," McIntyre quipped. "If he's not sick and dying you w=
ould think he would be willing to stay four months."=20
Some may argue that money isn't an issue for Skilling. According to recent d=
ata compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call, Skilling owns nearly 1.1 milli=
on shares of Enron, worth more than $42 million at today's price.=20
Skilling also has been retained as a consultant under terms that have not be=
en released by the company. Calls to the company seeking clarification were =
not returned, leaving questions unanswered.=20
"I just don't think you can understand it," says McIntyre. "You might as wel=
l watch cows fly out the window."=20
