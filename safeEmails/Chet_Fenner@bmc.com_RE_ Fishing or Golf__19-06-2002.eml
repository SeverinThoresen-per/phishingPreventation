Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about =
fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?

If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to g=
et on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.

=20

Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?

Chad, the time in the "stall" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.
