I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are p=
articipating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson wou=
ld also be great choices.

Stan's been invited to present at a broadcast that SGA is hosting.  Apparent=
ly, Jerry Halverson indicated to this organization that Stan would be a grea=
t person to represent the industry.  Would you both take a look at the agend=
a for the broadcast and let me know if you think this is something that Stan=
 should participate in?

If it is something that you think is worthwhile, I would work with INGAA on =
exactly what message they want Stan to communicate.

Thanks for your insight.

Can I get your opinion by Thursday?

Gina
