Veronica,
I assume that since you did not get back to us that there are no LC's expiri=
ng in January for non-terminated masters or trades where we are in the money=
=2E  If that is the case then we need to start looking at those LC's for Feb=
ruary and March to avoid any time constraints in getting replacement LC's.  =
Please revert back to Sara with copies of the LC's that expire in February a=
nd March for the non-terminated masters and contracts that are in the money.

Regards,=20
Brent

I am trying to determine if there are any of the LC's expiring in January th=
at we can request renewal for.  Veronica were you able to narrow down the li=
st to ones that are non-terminated where Enron is still exposed?  Please cal=
l to discuss.
Regards,
Brent
