Postle,

I just did a download from Global Facilities of all the delivery points asso=
ciated with Mid-C, NP15, SP15 and Rockies.  You might want to get with Kara =
(or someone else in scheduling) to determine which points are still actively=
 used.  If you find that you're deleting alot more than you're keeping (as w=
as our case), simply highlight the ones you want to take forward to UBS and =
send the file to Kim Theriot.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey
