Gentlemen -

I remembered that I'm in deposition on Tuesday and will have difficulty=20
presenting Yao to the Legal VP PRC.  Can I ask for help from one of you?

On Monday, I'll send over a print-out of Yao's reviews and accomplishments=20
for the first 6 months.

Yao has been a big help to me.  He effectively took over Frank Sayre's old=20
job and has acted like my second-in-command in EGA Legal.  That has meant=20
more as I've been pretty tied up with Dabhol.

Yao also took on SECLP, the Dabhol of the Carribean.  Candidly speaking,=20
SECLP is not like the typical Enron project that has failed.  In most cases,=
=20
we have professional lawyering which wrapped a bad business deal (e.g.,=20
Dabhol or Hainan).  SECLP has very poor documentation and poor execution --=20
it is a mess in almost every way (e.g., partner, equipment, documentation,=20
business decisions).  Yao has really stepped in and taken as much control as=
=20
possible in this mess.  I believe that we have over $100 million at risk on=20
SECLP.

Finally, the Nigeria team has imploded.  The team felt that they were cheate=
d=20
on their NPV bonus pool on the first $30 million that we made on the=20
project.  I'm sad to say that it has affected their behavior in going after=20
the up to $40 million of Enron profit that remains on the project.  Yao has=20
continued working the deal as best as possible in their absence.  I think=20
that there is a 50% chance that we can get all or most of the remaining $40=20
million in this deal and Yao will be largely responsible for helping to hold=
=20
it together.

I'm a Yao fan.  I respect his judgment and perserverance.  I write this at=20
1:30 p.m. on a Saturday and he is down the hall on the phone about the=20
Nigeria project.

Bruce
