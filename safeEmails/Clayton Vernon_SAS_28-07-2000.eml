to the group:

if you wish to use SAS, there are a few simple things you need to do:

1) you need to get a Unix password if you don't already have one (your user=20
id will be the same as on the NT network, but a different password is issued=
)
2) you need a program called "Exceed" on your PC.  request it from IT (you=20
already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform)
3) you need an "ftp" program on your PC. you can go to www.download.com and=20
download one (i like wsftp)
4) Exceed is funny in the way it runs. When you invoke Exceed (or LIM=20
Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install=20
itself the first time, and will then "disappear" to the Taskbar. you need to=
=20
*right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose "Tools" and "Client=20
Startup" and then "New."

You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow=20
emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name an=
d=20
Password, set the Host Name to:=20

capers.ect.enron.com

and then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):

/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @D

Then, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run!=
=20
menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the=
=20
serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home=20
directory. From here, if you simply type "sas" the 3 windows for an=20
interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in busines=
s.

5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the=20
software, and then create a new session called "enron" where you choose as=20
the server simply "earth" (do not add any further descriptors such as=20
=2Eenron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the "remembe=
r=20
password" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg,=20
host type as "automatic detect").

when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home=20
directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in=20
under Exceed.

if you have any problems, i'll be happy to help

Clayton

PS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll=
=20
just write your name down when you take them.
