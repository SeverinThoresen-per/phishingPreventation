Matt,

 I've reviewed your good summary (which I know is subject to Eric Tan's=20
review).  As you know, David has asked you in an e-mail sent today whether=20
you have any evidence that the D3605 method with ashing was used at loadport=
,=20
as your summary indicates.  In addition, I have the following questions for=20
when you have time to take a look at them; there are a lot, so don't feel=20
like you have to get them all answered tomorrow:

 1. Was filterable dirt analysis used at loadport? YES  If not, why not?  If=
=20
so, what was the test method and results? D2276 ON SPEC AT 2.0 If a test=20
other than D2276 was used, why was some other test used?  If (a) no=20
filterable dirt analysis was done at all or (b) some method other than D2276=
=20
was used, on whose recommendation/authority was this done?  Do we have any=20
evidence that FGH was on notice/agreed to this?

 2.  Why was D5452 used for filterable dirt on the Ship Composite sample=20
taken before discharge at Thailand?SGS THAILAND WAS NOT ABLE TO USE D2276. I=
=20
WILL FORWARD E-MAIL DATED 05/07/00 FROM SGS THAILAND ON THIS ISSUE=20
SEPARATELY. On whose recommendation/authority was this done? D5452 WAS=20
RECOMMENDED BY SGS THAILAND AND APPROVED BY ERIC.  Do we have any evidence=20
that FGH was on notice/agreed to this?  NO. TESTS SUBSEQUENT TO REJECTION=20
WERE CONDUCTED BY ECTRS IN ATTEMPT TO VERIFY CAUSE/SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION=20
AND HOPEFULLY RECTIFY AND DELIVER TO FGH. ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW WE WERE DOING=20
RE-TESTS, FGH WAS NOT INVOLVED.

 3.  Was D2276 used at any time on the Ship Composite sample taken before=20
discharge at Thailand? NO. THERE WAS NO OTHER SHIP COMPOSITE SAMPLE=20
AVAILABLE. ALL OTHER "THAILAND" TESTS ARE FROM SHORETANK SAMPLES. If so, wha=
t=20
were the results?  If the decision was made not to use D2276, again, on whos=
e=20
recommendation/authority was this done?   Do we have any evidence that FGH=20
was on notice/agreed to this?=20

 4.  Why/how did Caleb Brett Singapore/Subic Bay get involved?  BECAUSE OF=20
THE VARIATION IN TEST RESULTS, ECTRS WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT A=20
FAULT IN SGS TESTING PROCEDURE AND ENGAGED CALEB BRETT TO DO AN INDEPENDENT=20
TESTS AS A COUNTER CHECK. AT THIS STAGE, ECTRS WAS STILL HOPINGTO RECTIFY TH=
E=20
SITUATION AND DELIVER THE CARGO TO FGH.

 5. Re the Caleb Brett Singapore testing, all the usual questions about why=20
D5184/5185 were used (instead of D3605), whether Caleb Brett tested for=20
filterable dirt, etc. CALEB BRETT SUBIC/SINGAPORE DO NOT USE D3605 FOR=20
METALS. I WILL FORWARD E-MAIL DATED 17/07/00 FROM CALEB BRETT SINGAPORE ON=20
THIS SUBJECT SEPARATELY. D5184/5185 WAS RECOMMENDED BY CALEB BRETT AND AGREE=
D=20
TO BY ERIC TO COUNTER CHECK ON SGS TEST RESULTS. AGAIN, THESE TESTS WERE=20
CARRIED OUT BY ECTRS WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF FGH WHICH HAS AT THE TIME=20
ALREADY REJECTED THE CARGO. ECTRS WAS AT THE TIME ATTEMPTING TO FIND THE=20
FAULT AND HOPEFULLY RECTIFY IT AND DELIVER THE CARGO TO FGH.

Again, please do not go outside Enron for answers to these questions.  Don't=
=20
hesitate to ask if they require clarification.  I greatly appreciate your=20
help.

       Britt =20
