What I heard was this was being handled by Exelon guys, so it makes sense.  =
These guys prefer dealing with old utiliity guys and so we will need to brea=

We spoke to our contact at Comed and he gave us the names of two other conta=
cts at Exelon that would be handling those type of options.  Doug and Maria =
left messages when I was out of the office.  We have yet to hear back from t=
hem.
