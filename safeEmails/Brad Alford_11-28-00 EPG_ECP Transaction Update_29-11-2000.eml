We are approaching the final countdown as to signing our definitive agreemen=
t=20
with El Paso regarding the sale of JEDI II's 51% interest in East Coast Powe=
r=20
and ENA's $157.9mm of ECP Subordinated Notes. =20

The transaction has continued to develop along the lines of my last update o=
f=20
11-21-00.  The terms and economics remain essentially as outlined on=20
11-21-00.  In summary, the primary form of consideration will be a=20
derivative-like commodity agreement or a 'contract for differences'.  This=20
contract will be exchanged in full for the SubNotes and the majority of our=20
equity interest.  The JEDI II equity interest will also receive a residual=20
contingent interest which will become payable in the event of a PPA=20
restructuring at the Linden facility.  We are calling the derivative a swap=20
but it is more like a receivable.  An El Paso affiliate (guaranteed by El=20
Paso as parent) will notionally be paying NYMEX plus approx $0.52=20
(escalating) over seven years on a notional volume of 300,000 MMBtu/d and=20
receiving NYMEX.  With netting the contract is simply a series of fixed=20
quarterly payments over seven years.  No offset rights and no limitations on=
=20
the guarantee - fully a stand alone agreement. =20

We are optimistic that we may be able to sign documents as early as Thursday=
=20
night.  This agreement can be terminated at our option in the event that we=20
do not receive the necessary internal approvals.  There are only two=20
significant external approvals required, a NJ Environmental=20
'non-applicability' determination and ECP credit ratings reaffirmation. =20
Accordingly we expect at this time to receive the necessary internal and=20
external approvals and close by year end.  We expect that a public=20
announcement would be appropriate at the time both parties have received all=
=20
necessary internal approvals.

The portion of the commodity contract being exchanged for the SubNotes is=20
expected to be offered to Condor to monetize this portion of the contract at=
=20
year end.  Subsequent to Condor's acquisition of its contract, both JEDI II'=
s=20
contract and the Condor contract are expected to be monetized in a QSPE=20
vehicle later in the first quarter. =20

Please call or email with any questions you may have.  Thanks for your=20
assistance in these matters.
