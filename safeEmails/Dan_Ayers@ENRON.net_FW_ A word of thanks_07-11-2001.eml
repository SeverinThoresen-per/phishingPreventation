Mr. Lay,

I realize that during these particularly tough times that you probably will =
not have the time to read this. In addition, I presume that you have receive=
d a high volume of notes from your employees regarding the issues of the day=
=2E I do hope, however, that you will take a moment to consider my thoughts =
and to step back from today's headlines and consider all of the tremendous o=
pportunities that you have given all of your employees over the past 16 year=
s. Your vision and hard work has accomplished more than just a business; it =
has provided many thousands of families support and structure.=20

I moved to Houston last year to continue my EBS career. I am over 52 years o=
ld with a career in telecommunications sales and sales management. I continu=
e to be excited about EBS opportunities; even though the rumors have us elim=
inated. The industry will improve. Our time should be spent cultivating futu=
re business relationships and becoming a fixture at the prospective counter =
parties' decision table. Anyway, my decision to move to Houston rather than =
to accept an ATT Natl Accounts Mngr continues to be the correct move in my o=
pinion. I must admit that if EBS goes down; I will be in a very difficult po=
sition (at my age) to find another position; but the point is this...I do no=
t want to work for any other company other than Enron. I made a commitment t=
o EBS two years ago; and I have not swayed. I want to continue to work as a =
midmarketer for Enron and I thank you for your commitment to me and your oth=
er employees at Enron.  =20
