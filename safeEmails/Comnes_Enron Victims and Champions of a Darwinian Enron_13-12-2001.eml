Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass l=
ayoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case =
study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: =
the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of w=
ork in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their re=
tirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furi=
ous at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrep=
reneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 =
behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that wor=
ked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experimen=
t with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where,=
 they wonder, can they go from here?

"Innovative is a clich=E9, but that's what Enron was," Brandon Rigney, who o=
perated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. "This is four days gone fr=
om the place, and I'm already in withdrawal."

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the=
 world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts =
program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450=
 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating =
jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company'=
s energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29=
-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions=
=2E

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff =
Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34,=
 he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets=
=2E

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because =
it "didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity."

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with conventio=
n and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corpora=
te entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative co=
mpany for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work=
 of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six =
months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company test=
ed new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marke=
tplace.

"You could come up with an idea and get people excited," said Janel Guerrero=
, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a fri=
end in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron star=
ted moving on it quickly.

"You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being =
a first mover," she added.=20

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp =
and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a pr=
ice. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water c=
ompany. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

"When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it w=
as innovative," Mr. Rigney said. "When people said, `We'll trade water and w=
aste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear disse=
nt in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it=
 made my head throb."

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful e=
nergy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too mu=
ch borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, =
it was buzzing with new ventures.

"I just got here five months ago," said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attendin=
g a Houston job fair. "I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rol=
ling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight."

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there als=
o encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and ma=
nagement arrogance.

"It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon," said Harvey J. Padewer, presiden=
t of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. "They creat=
ed a kill-and-eat culture."

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. "People tried t=
o take work away from you," he said. "There was a Darwinism for ideas, for p=
rojects."

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely=
 believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other c=
ompanies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-te=
rm effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of =
the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. "T=
here were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things diffe=
rently," said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. "I was one o=
f the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief."

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do=
 atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect o=
f being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric util=
ity.

"They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went t=
o the University of Nebraska," one former Enron employee said. "We had all t=
hese hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked."

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2=
 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, tele=
vision crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and =
carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put fini=
shing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. =
Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up=
 and wondering.

"I don't think Enron will ever be recreated," Mr. Shankman said on Thursday,=
 sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at En=
ron. "Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early."

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate cultu=
re that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning deb=
t of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meant=
ime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are w=
riting letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they th=
ought they were part of something special.

"Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts," wr=
ote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. "By far the best days of my c=
areer were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. V=
ery busy, very progressive and innovative."

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the co=
mpany to fall so swiftly.

"I really hope the company turns around," she wrote. "But I know it will nev=
er be the same."
