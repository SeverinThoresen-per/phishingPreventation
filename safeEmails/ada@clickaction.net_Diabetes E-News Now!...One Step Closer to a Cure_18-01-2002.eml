IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that=
 at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of=
 health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be=
 caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating =
and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressu=
re, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome =
greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In Type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune=
 system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, st=
opping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For thi=
s reason, people with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves =
on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recen=
tly found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas ca=
n regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the di=
sease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with =
cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, howeve=
r, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk f=
or cardiovascular disease, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest =
pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University i=
n England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) sign=
ificantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk du=
e to related conditions.
