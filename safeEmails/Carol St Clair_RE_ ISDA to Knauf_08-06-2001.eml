Carol,=20
The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial=20
customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern=
=20
California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a=20
price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to d=
o=20
an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA=20
background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with th=
e=20
City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us=20
in this manner?  ----cgy =20
