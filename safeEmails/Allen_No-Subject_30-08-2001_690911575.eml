Any word on the release agreement?  Have you sent all the comments back to K=
evin Kolb?  I can't tell if they are the hold-up or if we are.
I am going to be in San Marcos next Friday.  It would be good if we could ha=
ve things signed by then so we can exchange funds.
Please email with status update.

Phillip
