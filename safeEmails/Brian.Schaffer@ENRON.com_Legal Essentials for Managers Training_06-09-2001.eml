	As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance with=
 labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  Thi=
s 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-specifi=
c issues.  Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendance f=
or all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory respon=
sibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-rela=
ted litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee pro=
ductivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understa=
nd the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal req=
uirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment=
 free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance manage=
ment; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effe=
ctively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.  They =
run from 8:00 to Noon.  Please=20
contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these =
sessions.  She will then provide you the exact location and other particular=
s.

	Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Brian
