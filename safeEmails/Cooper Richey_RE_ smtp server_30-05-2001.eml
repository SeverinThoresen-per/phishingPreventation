The biggest thing here seems to be the issue of the reverse lookups. I don't=
 know if transmitting the subdomain is an actual error on our part, but it's=
 certainly something that can be eliminated by configuration on our server- =
there's a sendmail.cf parameter specifically dedicated to set your domain id=
entification.

In addition, the app I'm using to send messages is still running under NT4.

It may be that the problem rests with Telus up here in Calgary, but it may b=
e=20
internal as well. =20

In answer to your previous question, no sql dbs are sending these messages o=
ut. =20
Basically, it's Tim H., Maria Van Houten, and myself. =20

All:

I started having problems a couple of weeks ago, around the time of our Wind=
ows 2000 migration. I worked on this a little yesterday, got past my own pro=
blems, and found 3 things:

	1. The command line mailer that I use for programmed email transmissions is=
 blat, and some features weren't working under 2000- upgrading to the latest=
 version fixed this;
	2. mail.ect.enron.com accepts and transmits everything, but relays and rece=
iving servers that do reverse name lookups reject the default domain name th=
at our server transmits. In my case, this is theizen@dserv1.ect.enron.com. T=
he problem seems to be the "dserv1.ect." part, because telling blat to trans=
mit a specific id, e.g. theizen@enron.com, works without problems. I've adde=
d this switch to my scripts, and they're all working.
	3. The address that I was testing for Cooper, "4035123312@text.telus.com" i=
s reachable, but the user seems to be unknown.

I'll need a little time to dig on this one. When did the bounced messages st=
art?

Dan,

Both Portland and Calgary Fundamentals groups use an smtp server located in =
Houston to=20
automatically (with a program) send out messages based on market data.  Thes=
e messages=20
are sent to both internal (enron.com) and external (cellphones, blackberries=
, etc.) addresses. =20

Recently, some (not all) of the external messages have bounced, and Tim Heiz=
enrader and I are
getting a variety of error messages and its not clear exactly what the sourc=
e of the problem
is (win2k, new firewall procedures, new mail server procedures, errors in sm=
s servers on=20
the other end).  Effectively, the problem can be in 4 areas=20
	the apps we use to send the messages
	the smtp server
	the enron firewall
	the message recipient servers

As usual, it seems like it may be a combination of these things.

The server we are using to send these messages out is mail.ect.enron.com (wh=
ich resolves=20
to dserve1.ect.enron.com).  Can you tell me if there have been any policy ch=
anges regarding
the smtp server (dserve1.ect.enron.com) or the firewall that would affect so=
me but not all external=20
messages?  (If so, we need to figure out a way to automatically send message=
s to external addresses
that is consistent with new policies)

FYI: we have been using this server for over a year and a half, but have nev=
er asked anyone=20
if we could use it, etc. =20

Thanks for your help
Cooper
