Why have you allowed this to happen....we have lost everything despite worki=
ng our butts off.

You have had the most talented people in the business as you keep reminding =
us, so why?

Your millions will keep you insulated from true hardship, we will have to en=
dure further hardship, including non payment of receipts incurred on behalf =
of doing business for Enron.

I don't regret my time here but I am disgusted at the mode of departure.

Regards,

Brian Hunter-Lindsay
