Daren you are correct in that this was only in MOPS for the 26th.  It was=20
edi'd over to POPS from the 25th through the 31st populating all days with=20
the 16,700 nom.  The nom was never -0- out in POPS therefore the change=20
notification process in POPS did not pick up a change at this meter.  This=20
meter is pathed by Kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this=20
was missed in MOPS.  The record would have been out of balance and someone,=20
if not several people, normally would make a comment on this.   Also  -  all=
=20
of my records indicate that the 16,700 was good through the 31st except the=20
MOPS entry.  My confirmations with Koch didn't reflect the -0- ;  the last=20
report I have from Koch indicated the 16,700 stayed on, there was no record=20
of a phone call indicating anything other than 16,700.  It is very odd for=20
this many checks and balances to fail.  Also, the volumes were being sent=20
back to MOPS which no one caught.  =20

I have spoken with Koch today and they agree that the 16,700 should have gon=
e=20
to -0- therefore I have removed the nom from POPS confirmed volumes and=20
re-allocated the meter.  The OBA has taken the hit and I am working off the=20
imbalance now.

Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my=20
responsibility.  Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors=20
because I was buried in current activity, thus the e-mail to you asking for=20
your help. =20

If this doesn't answer all the questions, just give me a call.

Thanks,

Charlotte

Stella and Charlotte,=20

I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the=20
path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated=20
and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a=20
bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified tha=
t=20
the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy=20
should have been found before we closed out January.

I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id=20
in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS). =20
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,=20
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not th=
e=20
problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an=20
explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas=20
was confirmed for the 27th-31st.

Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the=20
OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need=20
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This=20
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are=20
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no=20
pricing on those days. =20

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.
