We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support name=
s=20
and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me=20
how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp=
=20
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).=
 =20
Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore,=20
they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001,=
=20
which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call. =20
Thanx.
