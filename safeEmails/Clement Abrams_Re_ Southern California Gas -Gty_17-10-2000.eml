Looking through my e-mail messages, I did receive SoCal's comments on=20
Thursday afternoon of last week.  On cursory review, little if anything has=20
changed in the format.  SoCal has suggested splitting the one guarantee into=
=20
two guarantees, one for trading and the other for the tariff program.  With=20
respect to the guarantee for trading, SoCal has conceded on a few points. =20
Alternatively, SoCal has communicated that it will not concede with respect=20
to my comments on the guarantee for the tariff program.  Of course the lack=20
of changes with respect to my comments is not conducive for finalizing the=20
guarantees and, based upon numerous past examples, will result in protracted=
=20
negotiations.  I must add to the last sentence of your e-mail below, SoCal i=
s=20
unwilling to transact with Enron until we agree to its terms in the=20
guarantee.  Given the situation, and the desire to trade immediately with=20
SoCal, you may want to consider temporary security until we can reach=20
resolution on the guarantees.  The alternative is to suggest to SoCal that i=
t=20
has entered into several guarantees with Enron Corp. that in the past was=20
acceptable to SoCal, the most recent in June 2000, and that we find it=20
difficult to understand why SoCal is insistant on using the form that is=20
proposes. =20

Clement,

Please give me a status update on your review of the SoCal guaranty. =20
Conversations with their credit group indicate SoCal has sent back their=20
comments to the guaranty to you and are now waiting on your comments.  As I=20
have mentioned in previous e-mails, SoCal is unwilling to transact with Enro=
n=20
until the guaranty situation has been resolved. =20

Thank you,
Russell
