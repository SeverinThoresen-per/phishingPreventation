Sally and Brian,
Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned =
over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of rec=
ords to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We wi=
ll continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the tr=
ansition of personnel from Enron to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of the=
 HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three t=
o ten individuals.

Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or con=
cerns.

Thank you,
Carolyn Gilley
