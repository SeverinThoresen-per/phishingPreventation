Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you want=
ed
an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6=20
markets
until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.  =
 I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 360=
0
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.
