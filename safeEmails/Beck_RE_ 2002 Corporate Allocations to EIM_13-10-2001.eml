Our meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.  Ra=
y Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with Kevin Sweeney - Ray =
just initiated that meeting himself with Kevin one day last week, spur of th=
e moment.  But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken=
 place.  I have been working with Kent Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week=
 to arrange our meeting now set for Monday. =20

I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at=
 this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --Sally=20

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that=
 EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification=
 for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we =
have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasona=
ble charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination wa=
s based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected serv=
ices provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are a=
lso performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget pr=
esentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come =
to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges=
 before such meeting.
