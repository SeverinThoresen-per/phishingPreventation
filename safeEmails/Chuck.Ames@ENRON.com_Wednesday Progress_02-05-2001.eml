Geoff,

Listing of current issues

Resaving and publishing of April 30th IM curves to show June values.  The po=
rtcalc's were bombing out because there was no prior June value in the curve=
s.  So as of May 1, they started bombing.  I have to find a way to re-post p=
rior day curves out into ERMS. =20

All the GDI curve manager files that are pulling the physical index curves s=
hould be ready by tonight.  I'm doing Texas as I write.  I think we should l=
eave the issue of who and how these curves are set up to the individual desk=
s.  For the central desk, we can use the term traders files to publish.  But=
, we could also set aside a separate file to merely listen to the phys idx c=
urves and publish them that way.  I'm going to release the files to the desk=
s for them to review and get back to me for changes and revisions. =20

The changes made into TDS deal evaluation are being revised today.  I guess =
there were some problems this morning and are now being fixed.

As for the position manager, there is an issue as to how we would like the N=
ew/ Changed/ New & Changed filter placed onto the position manager.  The iss=
ue there is that with the FX column in the positions tab, what should that p=
ositions tab look to as a filter if we place that function on the positions =
and cash tab.  Dave has suggested putting the filter in the menu area where =
you can manipulate it and then tab between columns.  I agreed that that was =
the best solution but I figure you should probably let me know ASAP whether =
you agree.

Other than that I don't know what else is new or important to add.  After I'=
m done calcing tonight I'll go ahead and publish the GDI curves myself.  Tom=
orrow morning I'll talk with the Risk leads and ask them if they can review =
and load the curves from here on out.  I'll also start modifying the curve f=
iles to include an additional month so we wont run into that problem again. =
 That should be done for EOD tomorrow.  Give me a call if you have any quest=
ions and/or problems.

Chuck
