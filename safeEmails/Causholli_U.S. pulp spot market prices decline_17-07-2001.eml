In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp pric=
es declined just over a percent while hardwood spot transactions took a larg=
er fall since July 2. Traders said that although some suppliers had pulled o=
ut of spot business, availability of various grades was still plentiful.
Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest dipped $5/tonne t=
o $420-$450/tonne, or 13 percent below July contract prices, paperloop sourc=
es said. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also fel=
l, down $5/tonne to $400-$430/tonne.
"Prices are still eroding in the States (because) a lot of spot is still ava=
ilable, it's all over the place," said a supplier source. But he added that =
spot prices had eroded so badly in Asian markets that he pulled out altogeth=
er. Previously, some suppliers had diverted tonnage to Asian markets because=
 of stronger demand for hardwoods there.
Both hardwood grades fell in the U.S. by $10/tonne on oversupply as producer=
s tried to edge down their inventories. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NB=
HK) closed the week about 18 percent below July contract prices at $340-380/=
tonne. Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) also ended at $340-380/tonne,=
 but the lower end prices were partly keyed by low freight costs. One source=
 noted that in the Northeast some buys were in "the low 300s."
"We have a ton of hardwood (available)," said a Midwest buyer source who ind=
icated he was recently offered about 2,000 tonnes of spot NBHK at $360.
