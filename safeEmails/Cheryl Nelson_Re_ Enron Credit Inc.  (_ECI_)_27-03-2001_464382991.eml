Hi Sara & Tom,

Sara, I stopped by your office to discuss ECI but you are in a meeting. =20

As per our discussion yesterday, I had a scheduled conference call with Anna=
=20
Meytina of Bear Stearns to discuss ECI.  (Sara, the call was not at 1:30 but=
=20
rather took place before noon today).   In light of our calls with Anna, her=
e=20
is where we stand:

1. Brokerage Agreement: I asked her how we are doing on getting the final=20
draft of the Agreement to me.  She indicated that she was trying to send a=20
redlined version today as promised.  She still has get approval on the=20
arbitration provision and limited liability provision from her Managing=20
Director.  this is what is manily holding up the process, not any lack of=20
diligence on our part.

2.  Assignment: Anna and I discussed my comments to the Assignment Agreement=
=20
-- she agreed to make all of the changes and to do so by the end of the day.=
 =20

3.  Guaranty: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call to discuss my=20
comments to the redlined guaranty she sent back to me.

Anna represented that, in light of the hold-up from her Managing Director, i=
t=20
was unlikely that she could get any agreement signed by the end of the day=20
today but agreed that Wednesday was a realistic possibility.
