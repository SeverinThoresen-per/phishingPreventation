I know someone in IT picked the computer up to send back to NYMEX.  I don't =
have confirmation if they had sent it back prior to the filing.  I have call=
ed this individual several times at home but have not heard back.

It was never moved here from ECN during our move.  Do you have a bar code or=
 any type of serial number for me to be able to find it?  I don't see how th=
e computer could have just dissappeared. When Dutch originally talked to Pau=
l Jordan and told him that it was not being used anymore, he was going to ha=
ve it moved. Who else can we talk to about where this computer could have go=
ne?  I will go over to the new building tommorrow and take a look again.  Wi=
ll you meet me there?  I will call you before I go.
