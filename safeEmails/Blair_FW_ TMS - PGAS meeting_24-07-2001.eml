Rick this is the result of the problem I discovered when we first went to PG=
AS.    I turned it over to Dale Ratliff for NNG and passed it to Jeff May to=
 verify.   I am not sure if this will not become a different issue further d=
own the road when we will possibly want to provide the customer with as clos=
e to real time EFM data as possible.   There will be a time that we will pro=
bably have the capability to show numerous EFM data accumulation updates dur=
ing the current gas day.  That is one of the advantages of PGAS.

Tks - Mike W.

The change has been implemented to drop the CURRENT day from the extract pro=
cess. In this case, today is the 19th and there are NO daily records for the=
 19th in the file. Processing has just completed and this has been verified.=
 Earlier today I contacted the oncall person for each company and let them k=
now that the change had been implemeted and that no impact was expected to t=
heir processing. But, just in case, if there was a problem it may be associa=
ted with this change. I have no doubt that if there is a problem, everyone h=
as my number. It's like an old worn out shoe. Just to play it safe,,,,,,,,,

Work on this item has been delayed by our need to focus on other issues that=
 have arisen.  Jeff now estimates this change will be complete this Friday.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk=
 about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation=
 Summary.
=20
Issue:
=20
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag f=
or the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process curre=
nt gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the i=
ncomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacti=
ng the imbalance calculation.
=20
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current=
 day volumes=20
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
=20
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) =
volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract =
identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will mod=
ify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes inclu=
ded in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
=20
Blank     =3D Complete record
I             =3D Incomplete record
*             =3D Complete but edited record
=20
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have a=
ny question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you
Dale Ratliff
