ENA pays 89.17% of the demand  and commodity charges and 100% of the fuel. =20
Now we pay the pipelines 100% and Boston Gas reimburses us the difference. =20
Our Canadian producer group is charged the whole 89.17% of the transportatio=
n=20
charges and all of the fuel in their netback pricing.

Hope this answers your question...
