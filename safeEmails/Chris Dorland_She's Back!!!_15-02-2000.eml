Hi Chris,

I thought I would send you my new business vCard and a brief description of
my service offerings. I will be sending out hard copies of my business cards
in a few weeks or if I see you at CERI in Calgary, I can give you one then.

SigmaRisk Analytics is a risk management consulting firm for natural gas,
electricity and oil.  Service offerings include evaluation of physical and
financial strategies, risk evaluation and audits, design and implementation
of risk management programs (Front, Middle and Back Offices), risk
management software evaluation, and educational seminars.

Regards,
Una
