Thanks Howard -- for the SE, we are pushing the one control area, but we may=
 get there via unbalanced schedules and real time market (which actually pro=
vides the control area competitve advantages to all without undoing the curr=
ent control areas.)  Currently, the "business models" in the SE are pretty m=
uch keeping control areas as usual.  I don't think that our NE group agreein=
g to more than one control area on the basis that the NE will have a one mar=
ket model in place hurts us here.  We would be way ahead of the game if we a=
lready had that in the SE.

Attached are some suggested minor revisions to the Enron opening statement p=
reviously circulated by Dan Allegretti. I've added a paragraph to indicate o=
ur general agreement with the key principles developed by the group of gener=
ators and marketers. Also, we continue to call for one control area; the res=
t of the marketers/generators  thought that wasn't critical if you have one =
market and one RTO. i.e, there's nothing left for separate control areas to =
do that would conflict with each other; the staffs would all be part of one =
organization. Do we still feel strongly about this item?
