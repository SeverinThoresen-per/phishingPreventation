Enron Teams With  Compaq to Provide Capacity for One Million Simultaneous=20
Broadband Streams of  Windows Media Player
10:55 EDT Monday, April 10, 2000

    HOUSTON, April 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Broadband Services, Inc., a whol=
ly
owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and a leader in the delivery of
high bandwidth applications, announced today an alliance with Compaq, the
largest supplier of computer systems in the world, to enable Microsoft Windo=
ws
Media solutions over Enron's fiber optic high-bandwidth network.
    With this agreement, the Enron Intelligent Network(TM) and distributed
Compaq ProLiant servers will provide unprecedented levels of performance and
quality of service for Windows Media applications.  The Enron Intelligent
Network offers high quality of service, reliability and network control for
the delivery of TV-quality streaming video to the fastest growing media
customer base -- broadband Internet users.
    Enron and Compaq have teamed to make this breakthrough in video quality
easy for broadcasters and content providers to enhance the Internet experien=
ce
for their customers.  In live demonstrations this week at the National
Association of Broadcasters' show in Las Vegas, NAB 2000, the companies will
showcase how their combined technologies make this possible.
    Enron's video streaming services and the Enron Intelligent Network

"
said Joe Hirko, CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  "To ensure a highly
reliable, scalable, industrial-strength network on an ongoing basis, Enron's
distributed infrastructure design is continually evolving.  This requires a
regimen of testing and benchmarking.  Compaq has been an invaluable, trusted
partner in helping us further extend Enron's multiplatform capabilities."
    Compaq and Enron engineering teams worked together to simulate the high
volume loads of a live streaming media web event with as many as 10,000 user=
s
streaming broadband Windows Media from a single ProLiant server farm.  They
then translated the results into the Compaq architecture and system design f=
or
Enron's network and collaborated on product testing, quality control and
deployment.
    "Broadband applications are here now and represent a rapidly growing
requirement from Compaq's service provider and enterprise customers," said
Ashok Shah, Vice President North America, Compaq Professional Services.  "We
are pleased to be working with Enron on next generation broadband applicatio=
n
design and delivery in media and entertainment, as well as in areas such as
distance learning, health care and multimedia customer centers.  Enron is an
important reference to our 27,000 Compaq services professionals as we provid=
e
technology leadership and expertise to our client engagements."
    Enron and Compaq will work together to implement Microsoft Windows=20
2000internally as well as in product development for future product=20
iterations.
The two organizations will collaborate on the development of strategy and be=
st
practices for large-scale, high-volume Windows Media applications and
deployments for service providers and enterprise customers.  Additionally,
