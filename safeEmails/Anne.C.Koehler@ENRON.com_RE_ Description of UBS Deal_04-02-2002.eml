Louise --

I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transfe=
rred from Enron to UBS.  If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being juris=
dictional assets, than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer befo=
re the transfer.  Clearly, customer specific data will create more issues th=
an generic market information.  I need to check what happens if you have del=
eted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data.

Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday?

Also, I understand the "adoption" by UBS of Enron contracts.  Initially I wa=
s under the impression that this was simply a "review".  Again, any transfer=
 of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron.  I ha=
ve seen one draft of the Interim Agreement, but assume that you would do thi=
s for EEI and other physical contracts.  Am I right?

Thanks,

Jim

Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names.

The Master Agreement and License Agreement mention that you have "Customer D=
ata".  Is this wrong?

Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have hist=
orical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from=
 Reuters.

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is =
transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a go=
od grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.
My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for a=
ll backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?
