Tim- Thanks for your note. Before Janet D. left she had requested additional=
 resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have =
assigned Tracy Ngo, Ed Sacks, Paul Radous and Wendy Conwell to power. We als=
o have moved other RAC people into credit, Mark Ruane (VP), Ken Curry (Dir),=
 and Carol North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people=
 trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. =
We are in the market for more.

It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need=
, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, doe=
s being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland.=20

I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in Houston and get her views as wel=
l.=20

Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course i=
f you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs l=
et us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required f=
or a strong performer to get up the Enron curve. Thanks, Rick

I understand from Tracy Ngo that as a result of some organizational changes =
in RAROC there might be some personnel movement in your group.  As indicated=
 in the e-mail below, our Portland Middle Market Group would like to see mor=
e resources dedicated to the credit function.  As a result of a number of fa=
ctors credit is being asked to review a very large number of new counterpart=
ies and transactions for the Middle Market Group and it is typically taking =
2 - 7 days to get a credit review turned around.  As you know, we believe ex=
isting personnel is top notch   There just aren't enough of them.  And, amon=
gst all the RAC groups with whom we work, market risk and credit risk, it se=
ems like resources are more constrained in the credit area.  We would love t=
o see that reduced and anything you could do to make this happen would be ap=
preciated. =20

Thanks

Tim

Bill:

As I think you are aware, the Middle Market (MM) Group in Portland has been =
interacting with your credit group with increasing frequency.  We are counti=
ng on you to complete credit analyses that allow MM deals to be closed.  Alt=
hough I don't think we have lost any deals as a result of the not doing cred=
it analyses in time, we have been on the edge for weeks and a couple of deal=
s have come down to the wire.  Anything you can do to allocate additional re=
sources to credit analysis would be appreciated.

There are 3 forces currently aligned that make MM success highly contingent =
upon your credit group doing credit analyses to allow transactions to be clo=
sed.=20

1.  Movement from WSPP to EEI contracts.  We are at a record pace with respe=
ct to getting new master agreements in place with counterparties.  Already t=
his year we have done about 10 - 15 new EEIs, all of which require a credit =
analysis. =20

2.  We continue to look at longer dated transactions that require special cr=
edit analysis.

3.  California credit risks are particularly high given what is going on wit=
h the "energy crisis."

The quality of work we get from Tracy, Ed, Wendy and Paul is nothing less th=
an phenomenal.  We also have implemented a priority list that we use to iden=
tify the most critical transactions so we do not overburden your people with=
 trivial requests.  It still takes typically about a week to get a credit wo=
rksheet done for a new EEI and most new deals are requiring an EEI.  In some=
 cases, a quicker turn around is essential.  It seems to us that additional =
resources are warranted. =20

I am pretty sure you are aware of this and are taking whatever action you ca=
n, but I thought it would be useful to document our needs to arm you with in=
formation if you  have internal negotiations to manage. =20

Please let me know if you have any questions at 503/464-3822.=20

Thanks!

Chris
