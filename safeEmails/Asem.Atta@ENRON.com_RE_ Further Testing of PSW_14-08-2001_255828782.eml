Cara,

	Understood, and your plan sounds fine.. any chance of you copying that prod=
uction sheet onto your local machine and using it as your own 'test' copy th=
en?
	The plan for having the reports merged with AggSchedVol data, talking with =
the team and Poston for info gathering, is a month after full initial releas=
e of our current phase.

thanks=20

What I meant was I would run one day and put test data in the production she=
et (since there is not a test sheet of that), and then go get rid of that da=
y when it looks like it calculated right.

I know so little about that sheet, I am a typical user and just know what I =
want.  How long after the initial release into production do you all think I=
t will be until we get the project cleared to have this data merged with the=
 AggSchedVol Data? That is the ultimate goal.  Poston has his FSP data that =
will be part of this too.

Cara,

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you l=
og in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe=
=2E. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summa=
ry detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros a=
nd such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.=
=2E do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy=
 to help.
regards

Hi Asem;


O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls
This is the right address.  I am reluctant to add data to the production mod=
el, as it will mess up my reports.  I might rename a test file with a strang=
e date, and then purge it.

That should work, eh?


Thanks,

C

Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled Physica=
lAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to =
the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about lo=
cations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Port=
land\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfo=
rtunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself.=20

thanks

"Unable to locate M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\Stage\PhysicalAndBookout=
