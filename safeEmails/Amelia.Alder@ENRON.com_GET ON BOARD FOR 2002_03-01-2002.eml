Hey guys!  I know you've been wondering what's going to happen to Team Enron=
 for the 2002 MS150.  Going forward, Enron will not be able to fund the team=
, but I have some very good news for you!  Sun & Ski has adopted us so we ca=
n stay together, and all we have to do is change our name.  We will be Team =
Sun & Ski, with an official announcement of the name coming out a bit later,=
 but since the deal was just finalized, I wanted you to be the first to know=
 that we have a new arrangement while we are working out all the details.

We will have all the same amenities we have enjoyed over the years, and our =
new sponsor has asked me to stay on as Team Captain, which makes me very hap=
py, as that saves me from a major identity crisis.  Don't know what I would =
do without you guys!  Just wanted you to know that I will still be your poin=
t of contact for all communications.  Please do not try to get info from the=
 Sun & Ski stores, as their staff would not be prepared to answer any team q=
uestions this early in the planning stages.

We want to retain your participation, and plan to make our new team bigger a=
nd better than ever!

All the details will be forthcoming by e-mail as soon as we have anything to=
 tell you about registration and all the other plans we have in store for yo=
u.  We have about 50 of you registered already for Team Enron, and we will a=
utomatically put you on Team Sun & Ski unless I hear otherwise.

Stay tuned, and have a Happy New Year!
