	Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.

	For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Satur=
day morning.
	Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  S=
ystem was fixed by 11:30 a.m.=20
	Saturday morning.

	On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.

	Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go wes=
t, therefore
	most of the gas is staying in the east market.

	Thanks. Lynn
