James, Cameron, Ian,

?

I got a call this morning from Marc Eichmann, a?DealBench Product Manager at=
=20
Enron Net Works.? He got my contact info from Ken Sommers, one of the=20
Procurement Managers in EES, who has been pushing to get our solutions=20
implemented.?=20

?

Marc is meeting today with a team of directors to determine how to go forwar=
d=20
in providing reverse auction and RFQ functionality to the various Enron=20
business.? They realize that DealBench does not provide the breadth of=20
functionality required to get acceptance by the buyers/dealmakers for daily=20
use.? Thus they are trying to determine whether to?put the time and resource=
s=20
into developing DealBench further or to strike a deal with a third party=20
vendor to enhance their platform.

?

The project is in its early stages.? Their timeline is 2-3 months before=20
implementation.? Enron business units would be the primary users of the=20
software, but?they would eventually want to sell this service out to all=20
users of EnronOnline.? Marc said they would want to be able to open up the=20
code and conjoin our software with theirs.?=20

?

He wants us to basically hand it away.? I discussed our standard Enterprise=20
pricing and the Charter Program offer we have given to GSS and EES, and he=20
still felt this was beyond their budget.? He emphasized how much business=20
volume runs through EnronOnline and how good an opportunity this would be fo=
r=20
us.? I told him I would like to have our VP Business Development speak with=20
him to discuss any further business relationship and pricing details.? Marc=20
can be reached at 713-345-8422 or marc.eichmann@enron.com.?

?

I've tried to followup with Ken Sommers and Eugene Ribaudo to get a feel for=
=20
how we might be able to proceed with a sale directly?to EES versus a marriag=
e=20
with DealBench.? Ken is out of town this week, but hopefully will respond to=
=20
my voice mail and email.? Let me know how to proceed.

?

Thanks,
