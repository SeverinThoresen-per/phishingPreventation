Louise:

I have a call in to Ben to discuss the idea.  With respect to your message o=
n Steve Pearlman, I worked with him for about a year.  He is extremely intel=
ligent and knowledgeable of the power industry.  He sometimes has a tendency=
 to over-analyze issues, but I think he understands risks in the industry mu=
ch more than many people in our organization.  He has closed and can close t=
ransaction.  I have a lot of respect for him and I think he will more than p=
ay for himself in the long-run (responding to your question on how much he w=
ill make).

Brett

What I was trying to call you about was an idea.  The way Ben and Chris curr=
ently run the turbine book is they share everything 50:50 - upsides and down=
sides.  I thought it might be a good idea to involve you so the turbine book=
 is split 33:33:33.  Obviously there is a transfer price out to projects (in=
ternal and Riogen would be included) but this would mean our successful turb=
ine team would have all the right incentives to assist you with the Mitsubis=
his.

If you think its a good idea - please talk to Ben or Chris (Calger) who have=
 discussed this themselves.

You would need an out for RioGen agreed upfront.

Regards

Louise
