Kam,

Many of the SW curves have become obsolete since losing Enron's obscure deal=
s.  Therefore, we would prefer to reduce our curves to the following:
=09
	BASIS				INDEX				GDI-Index			PHYS		=09

	NGI-SoCal			NGI-SOCAL			GDP-CAL BORDER		NGI-SOCAL
	IF-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ			GDP-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ
					IF-ELPO/PERMIAN		GDP-ELPO/PERM		IF-ELPO/PERMIAN



Mike would like to kill Kingsgate in the NW.

Thanks

We have created six new curve files for UBS.  Could you please look at them =
and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not respons=
ible for and we will move them.  Also, you can use these files to change or =
update your links.    O:\_dropbox\West Curves

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our =
final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with=
 this.=20

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them=
 to the new database?

Thanks

Kam

't know where he left off.
