I think this covers it.  The one issue that you may want to clarify is that =
the second termination option would entail payouts over time, until the term=
ination of the fund, which Gene believes may have some real value.  Michelle

Hello everyone,

Attached is a summary write-up I've prepared on the EIP Plan (it's origin, c=
urrent status and why we feel it s/b terminated) to deliver to Mary Joyce fo=
r her conversation with Mark Frevert.  I felt it a good idea to summarize al=
l on one piece of papaer  in case Marke Frevert was not familar with the Pla=
n.  This Plan is pretty intense when even intimate with it's details!

Sheila/Michelle, could you pls. both review prior to me delivering to Mary t=
o see if I've missed anything or am describing anything incorrectly.  Pam is=
 out today.  I appreciate it.  After your review I'll deliver.  I feel it's =
going to be very critical to get Mark's support on this to take it to the "t=
ermination" level, so I want this to go smoothly.

I'm also going to dabble around with a few "settlement payout" scenarios, ba=
sed on the actual fund size, original expectations, remaining participants, =
etc.  I'll send to you for review and we'll have in our back pocket when it'=
s time to talk to Gene.

Thanks all!

Susan
