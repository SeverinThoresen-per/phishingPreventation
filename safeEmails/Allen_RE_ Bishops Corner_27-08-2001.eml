Phillip;

I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understan=
ding of where we are on that front.

I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about.  I am going =
to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon.

I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/de=
mand question accurately.  I also need to follow up on the permits and see w=
here they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of othe=
r items.

Talk to you soon.

Greg T.
