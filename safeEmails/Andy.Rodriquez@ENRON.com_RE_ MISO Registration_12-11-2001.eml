David,

I'm sorry if this wasn't clear.  I actually work with Christi and Susan (the=
y both sit right behind me).  We have looked at all the regulatory issues, a=
nd have collected the majority of the necessary data to move forward.  At th=
is point, I am working with Leslie Reeves and Ed Sacks to nail down some of =
the financial details.  After that, we just need to get Kevin Presto to sign=
 everything and submit the application/registration.

However, before we do so, I assumed and Ed Sacks confirmed that we will need=
 a legal review of those documents.  This does not mean reviewing the indust=
ry issues that Christi and Susan might do, but reviewing all the contractual=
 provisions to ensure we are not entering into anything we find unfair, oner=
ous, or contrary to our established procedures for such contracts. =20

Again, my apologies for not making this more clear in my letter to Elizabeth=
=2E.

to it until next week sometime.  Thanks, David

Elizabeth,

Attached please find some contractual documents related to the Midwest ISO a=
nd our ability to take service under their OATT.  I need to have them review=
ed as well as get some aid completing them.  I have attempted to complete as=
 much of the documents as possible.

Can you please task someone to look at these as soon as possible?  The MISO =
is expected to start offering service on November 15.  Unfortunately, they h=
ave not given us a lot of lead time on this.  I have already been working wi=
th Ed Sacks and Leslie Reeves to deal with credit and billing issues, but no=
w have collected much of the information and need to get the documents revie=
wed.

Thanks for your help.  One annoying problem with Sections 3-7 - they are in =
Adobe Acrobat, and can only be edited with Acrobat Writer.  I have tried get=
ting the editable originals from MISO, but have not had a lot of luck.  I ju=
st placed another call to them to request them again.

Please call me if you have any questions.
