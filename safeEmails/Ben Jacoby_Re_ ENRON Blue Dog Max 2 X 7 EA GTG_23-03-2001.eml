Dear Ben,
I have asked Gib Bosworth of GE Power Sys in Arizona to call you about the
availability of the 2 units we call Blue Dog.  He has a customer who is
interested in the units because of their timing.  I have advised him you are
also closely working with others for these turbines.

Ben Jacoby  713 853 - 6173    Gib Bosworth 480-888-1545
