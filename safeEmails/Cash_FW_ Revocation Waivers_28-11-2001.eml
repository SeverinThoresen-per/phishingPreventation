Subject:	Revocation Waivers

I would appreciate your help in communicating to the HR community that signe=
d waivers related to the revocation of job offers are to be placed in two lo=
cations:  (1) original to the vault; and (2) a copy to the application file =
kept by HR regarding the individual.

Thanks,
--Lizzette
