Larry:

I am working with Lou on the Gomez Title V issue.  We are preparing a submit=
tal to the TNRCC to void the Title V permit (Permit No. O-00754) for the gas=
 processing facilities.  Lou wanted to see if you knew whether the gas proce=
ssing equipment operated after 1995.  If if didn't operate, did it have the =
potential to operate? Was the equipment flanged off, shut down, removed from=
 the site, etc.?

Thanks,
Charlie
