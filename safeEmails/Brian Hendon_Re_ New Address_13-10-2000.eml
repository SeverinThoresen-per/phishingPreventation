I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever=20
floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in th=
e=20
confines of your own mind  : )

Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had=20
squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney,=20
remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue 013=
=20
from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes all=20
possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and Yankees hav=
e=20
no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas." =20

Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at the=
=20
game.

Brian
