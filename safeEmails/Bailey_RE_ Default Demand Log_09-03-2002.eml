Michael,

I will add these counterparties to the Demand Log -- as they may eventually =
become a defaulting party down the line.

Thanks for sending me the demand letter log.  Going through it, I found thre=
e companies that are on our live list, however, not in your demand letter lo=
g.  The three are live and performing so no demand letter is necessary (thou=
ght you might want to add them).

Belco Oil & Gas
DTE Energy Trading
Texland Limited Partnerships
