Hey guys....I need to take vacation on August 23rd & 24th. I will be taking,=
 what's become, my semi-annual pilgrimage to Aggieland. I'll be moving Daugh=
ter No. 2 into her new swingin' college apartment.=20

If all goes right I can get everything transported and moved in on Thursday.=
=2E..which will give my body three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday to rec=
over from the ordeal. =20

Any problems?
