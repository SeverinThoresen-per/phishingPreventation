The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) =
not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caus=
ed the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the brid=
ge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these=
 deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to resta=
rt, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic=
 when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.=20
