Will,
I ran another quick test this morning (spanning 0730 to 1015 due to other ev=
ents) for June 22.  The paths routed correctly and information went to the C=
onfirmation area properly. =20

Even though I had "East Power" checked in the confirmation area, all of the =
"West" paths also showed up too.
The only error message I got involved not being able to route transmission d=
eals.

I will do a more extensive study this afternoon.

CB=20
