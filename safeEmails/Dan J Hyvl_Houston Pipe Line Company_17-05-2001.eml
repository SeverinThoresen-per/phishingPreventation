Jeff,
 We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks=
=20
ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it=20
to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of=
=20
compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has als=
o=20
assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March=
=20
9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation=20
plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, =
I=20
will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options wil=
l=20
need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a dat=
e=20
that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated=20
that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit=20
in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan=20
which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see=
=20
no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP=20
appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the=20
case?
 Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand=
=20
how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for=
=20
a career opportunity with HPL.
