Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective=
 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.  Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not pa=
id any of their bills.  CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be pay=
ing Nabisco's bill.  I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nom=
inations for Nabisco and to keep me informed.
