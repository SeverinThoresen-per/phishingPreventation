Why does this person need Expertfinder?  I didn't get a specific reason from=
 prior emails.  If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it f=
or him?  More information would be helpful in making the determination of wh=
ether to allow him access.  Thanks.  Michelle

Yes, this mail never works right from home. =20

Michelle Cash needs to sign off on anyone asking for access that doesn't mee=
t the requirements.  Since Mike is a temporary employee, he doesn't meet the=
 criteria.  Via this email, I'll ask Michelle to approve or decline.

Thanks,
Kathy
