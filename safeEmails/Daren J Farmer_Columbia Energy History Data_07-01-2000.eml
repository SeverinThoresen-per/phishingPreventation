FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our=
=20
shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES=20
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal=
=20
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as=20
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer=20
and asset transactions.=20

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to=

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint=20
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES report=
s=20
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that=20
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system=
=2E
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using=20
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part o=
f=20
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group=
).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure=20
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloadin=
g=20
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than=20
EDMS.
