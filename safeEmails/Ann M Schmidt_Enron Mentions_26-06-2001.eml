Mr. Wagner urged the public officials and companies involved to reach an=20

India Flagging Asset Sales Risk Lower Moody's Outlook (Update2)

India Flagging Asset Sales Risk Lower Moody's Outlook (Update2)

     (Adds date Fitch lowered its outlook.)

     Mumbai, June 26 (Bloomberg) -- India must step up sales of
state assets and trim its budget deficit to avoid a reduction in
the outlook for its debt, said Kristin Lindow, vice president and
lead analyst for India at Moody's Investors Service.
     ``We are disappointed and would like to see urgency in
completing the economic reform process,'' Lindow said in an
interview. ``Our positive outlook on India is getting to a point
where we are wondering whether it shouldn't be changed.''
     A lower outlook for India's debt would mean the country and
its companies would miss a chance to reduce their borrowing costs,
among the region's highest. The yield on India's benchmark 10-year
bond fell 5 basis points to 9.52 percent today on expectations of
an interest rate cut. That's higher than 6.33 percent for
comparable Chinese bonds and 6.44 percent for South Korean bonds.
     Moody's gave India a positive outlook in June 1999, meaning
it was considering an upgrade of its ``Ba2'' rating, which is two
notches below investment grade and among the lowest in the region.
Since then, India has missed targets for the sale of state assets,
a move that would boost corporate performance and raise revenue
for the state.
     ``The timing of the government's sale of state-run companies
isn't good,'' Lindow said. ``Several of the companies have now
become unprofitable.''
     Among the state-run companies to be privatized are Indian
Airlines and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., a maker of power plant
equipment.

                         Airline Loss

     Indian Airlines lost 1.77 billion rupees ($38 million) in the
year ended March 31 and is expected to lose another 2.51 billion
rupees this financial year, according to media reports. Bharat
Heavy Electricals' profit for the year ended March 31 dropped 49
percent to 3.05 billion rupees.
     India needs money from sales in stakes of more than 200
companies to trim its budget deficit. In the fiscal year that
ended March 31, India planned to sell stakes in 43 companies to
raise 100 billion rupees. It made just one sale -- a 74 percent
stake in a bakery, Modern Food Industries, for 1 billion rupees.
     This year, India plans to raise 120 billion rupees through
asset sales. The government plans to trim the deficit to 4.7
percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year from an
estimated 5.2 percent of GDP last year.

                    Falling Bond Yields

     Government bond yields have been falling to record lows on
expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest
rates, following a widely predicted move by the U.S. Federal
Reserve later this week.
     ``There won't be any movement in the market based on the
possibility of Moody's lowering its outlook on India,'' said Rajiv
Anand, who manages 16 billion rupees of Indian debt for Standard
Chartered Mutual Fund. ``The correction would happen if Moody's
actually downgraded the rating.''
     Bond yields rose after ratings company Fitch cut India's long-
term sovereign ratings outlook to ``negative'' from ``stable'' on
May 31. Fitch, which rates India ``BB plus,'' one notch below
investment grade, cited ``concerns about fiscal policy,
privatization and a deterioration in the investment climate.''

                         Enron Dispute

     Lindow of Moody's said she was concerned about a dispute
between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron Corp.,
the country's biggest foreign investor, which built a $3 billion
power plant. The dispute is widely seen as a litmus test for
foreign investment in India.
     The state electricity board has refused to pay 3 billion
rupees for power supplied by Enron's local unit, Dhabol Power Co.
India hasn't delivered on guarantees to pay for the power. Lindow
also cited the Enron dispute as a cause
     ``Foreign investors are becoming wary because of Enron's
problem and the government failure to honor its contractual
obligation,'' Lindow said. ``It has put up several red flags.''
     A third major ratings company, Standard & Poor's, rates India
``BB,'' two notches below investment grade.

Of SMARTMONEY.COM=20

DESPITE THE ROUND-THE-CLOCK efforts of state and federal officials to solve=20
California?s energy crisis, residents are bracing for more rolling blackouts=
=20
this summer. And while the nation?s energy prices on the whole are starting=20
to decline, it?s clear that fossil fuels won?t light our homes and cool our=20
offices forever.
Even President Bush, a loyal oilman, understands this reality. While pushing=
=20
a reform plan heavy on fossil fuels last month, he acknowledged the need for=
=20
new, alternative-energy sources.=20
Of course, there?s still no consensus on what those sources will be, and thi=
s=20
is a high-risk game. Investors who pick correctly from among the leading=20
possibilities could find themselves sitting on a gusher during the next=20
energy crunch. But as anyone who invested in previous alternative-energy=20
sources like solar power, ethanol or - god forbid - cold fusion - can attest=
,=20
this is a business that?s big on dreams, long on waits and short on=20
commercially viable technologies.=20
And even the long-term winners among these stocks (if there are any) can be=20
counted on to deliver some major volatility in the meantime. The blame for=20
that goes to the California crisis, whose twists and turns drive=20
alternative-energy stocks up and down, headline by headline. "Anytime it=20
appears that the California panic is being solved, these stocks tend to trad=
e=20
down, so the sentiment is shifting on a daily basis," says Christine Farkas,=
=20
a Merrill Lynch energy analyst.=20
For adventurous investors who find such prospects electrifying, the most=20
promising technology at this point seems to be the fuel cell, a device that=20
extracts hydrogen from fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal and converts=
=20
it into electricity. Environmentalists love fuel cells because the byproduct=
s=20
of the electrochemical process - mostly heat and water vapor - include few=20
harmful emissions, especially when compared with what?s put out by internal=20
combustion engines.=20
Right now, the fuel-cell sector is crowded, with different companies at=20
different stages of the product-development cycle aiming for different=20
end-users. While some are building smaller fuel-cell systems to power cars,=20
others are constructing large fuel-cell-powered plants that can meet the=20
electricity needs of huge factories. Still others are targeting residential=20
uses. Which ones are likely to emerge as leaders? One may be FuelCell Energy=
=20
(FCEL). According to Chief Executive Jerry Leitman, the Danbury, Conn.-based=
=20
fuel-cell developer expects to start booking orders by year?s end for its=20
first product, a 300-kilowatt power plant roughly the size of a semi-trailer=
=20
that can light up the equivalent of 100 homes. Quieter and more mobile than=20
traditional electricity generators, the fuel-cell-powered plants can be=20
located closer to commercial and industrial customers, such as hospitals and=
=20
office buildings. Eventually, FuelCell plans to roll out 1.5 megawatt and=20
three megawatt units. Investors seem to like what they see. FuelCell?s stock=
=20
price, while highly volatile, has jumped 76% over the past year. (By=20
contrast, fuel-cell rival Plug Power?s (PLUG) residential products are=20
further from retail reality - and its stock is down 65% in the past 12=20
months. The same goes for Ballard Power Systems (BLDP), a Canadian firm=20
targeting the auto industry, whose shares have lost 50% in the last year.)=20
Earlier this month, FuelCell netted $241.5 million through a secondary stock=
=20
offering. CEO Leitman says the proceeds will be used to boost annual=20
manufacturing capacity to between 400 megawatts and 500 megawatts, a goal he=
=20
expects to reach in 2004. "That puts us into a profitable position when we=20
get to that 400 to 500 megawatts of production," he says. (Leitman declined=20
to offer more specific profit projections.) Merrill Lynch expects the compan=
y=20
to hit 400 megawatts of capacity in 2004 or 2005, with profitability coming=20
in 2005. In the interim, however, the earnings picture isn?t pretty. For its=
=20
second quarter ended April 30, FuelCell booked just $6.5 million in revenues=
=20
and posted a net loss of $5.1 million.=20
FuelCell investors were reminded about quickly shifting sentiment last=20
Tuesday. During a hearing over state funding of an Enron (ENE) fuel-cell=20
project in Connecticut, opponents of the plan suggested the money could be=20
better spent on other power endeavors. As a result FuelCell, which would=20
supply fuel cells to the power-plant project, saw its shares fall 17% to=20
$24.50 that day. In response to the sell-off, Friedman Billings upgraded the=
=20
stock to Buy from Accumulate, saying the drop was unwarranted since long-ter=
m=20
fundamentals remain very positive. FuelCell shares jumped 10% to $26.97 on=20
Wednesday. A final decision on the funding won?t be handed down by state=20
regulators until September. The next hearing is scheduled for mid July.=20
Another promising player is Active Power (ACPW), an Austin, Texas-based make=
r=20
of battery-free backup power systems. The gist: A spinning steel disk stores=
=20
kinetic energy, which kicks in when a primary power supply goes down. The=20
target audience includes high-tech firms and telecoms that rely on=20
uninterrupted power supplies. Active Power says one of its systems, about th=
e=20
size of a refrigerator, replaces 50,000 pounds of lead and sulfuric-acid=20
batteries.=20
The good news: Active Power already has products on the market. The most=20
promising, which went on sale last summer, is the CAT UPS, a flywheel-based=20
backup power system jointly developed with Caterpillar (CAT). Base units=20
retail for $90,000 to $115,000, with top-of-the-line configurations selling=20
for as much as $350,000. The product, which is expected to make up about 80%=
=20
of Active Power?s sales for 2001, is already having an impact on the top=20
line: Revenues jumped to $5.1 million in the first quarter, up 91% from the=20
fourth quarter. (It posted a net loss of $6.7 million, or 17 cents a share.)=

Active Power shares, which ended Friday at $18.47, are down 65% from their=20
first-day close of $52.75 but are still above their August 2000 offering=20

telecoms that?s being field-tested in 2001 with commercial rollout slated fo=

Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from=
=20
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FER=
C=20
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent=20
System Operator.
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could=20
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks.=20
Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars i=
n=20
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FER=
C=20
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will=20
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis=20
expects.=20
Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal,=20
and that is to bring back $9 billion."=20
Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO=20
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,=20
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October.=20
David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general=20
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but=20
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO.=20
Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork=

for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from=
=20
corporate energy suppliers.=20

getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated=
=20
by FERC.=20
Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators=20
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds.=20
State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation=20
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky=20
calculations."=20
To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices=20
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been=20
expected under competitive market conditions.=20
The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at=20
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices=20
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with=20
air-quality rules.=20
The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern=20
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the=20
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity.=20
The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power=20
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the=20
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents=
=2E=20
The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest=20
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid=

documents.=20

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - California and other Western states angered=20
by alleged bilking by power generators on Monday sought to convince the U.S.=

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief law judge to refund them some=20
$15 billion for wholesale power purchases made during the past year.=20
The settlement talks, involving dozens of companies and state officials from=

California and the Western region, were to continue for the next two weeks.
California alone believes it was bilked out of more than $9 billion by=20

its partially deregulated wholesale market.=20
"We are not going to ask FERC for $9 billion. We're going to ask for a lot=20
more than that for our litigating position," Michael Kahn, chairman of the=20
California Independent System Operator, told reporters outside the=20
closed-door settlement conference at FERC. The California ISO operates the=20
state's electricity transmission grid.=20
Judge Curtis Wagner, who convened the talks in a packed hearing room at FERC=

"The time to put California's past energy problems to rest and structure a=20

CLAIMS, COUNTER CLAIMS=20
While California claims it was overcharged by electricity generators who=20

=20
they have not yet been paid for some transactions.=20
The generators - including Enron Corp. , Duke Energy Corp. and Williams Cos.=

- have denied wrongdoing.=20
A representative from energy generator and marketer Reliant Energy Inc.=20
attending the settlement conference said he was concerned the California=20
Independent System Operator's method of calculating its $9 billion sales=20
overcharge figure is based on "black box" methodology.=20
"Those are mystical calculations," said John Stout of Reliant. "From what we=
=20
can gather they don't cover all our costs."=20
The ISO's cost calculations do not account for operation and maintenance fee=
s=20
of generating facilities, Stout said.=20
"That doesn't seem quite fair," he said.=20
In his statement opening the conference, Wagner acknowledged the enormous=20
sums at issue.=20
"This issue includes the enormous number of dollars in wholesale power that=20
have been purchased for PG&E Corp., SoCal Edison and (the state) Department=20
of Water Resources, for which the generators have not been paid," Wagner=20
said.=20
"On the other hand, the state of California alleges that its distribution=20
companies and the DWR have been overcharged $9 billion. The amounts involved=

While the state's power grid operator has vowed to press for more money,=20
California Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is owed roughly $9 billion=20
dollars for overcharges.=20
In April, the state's largest utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a unit o=
f=20
PG&E Corp. , voluntarily filed for protection from creditors due to the=20
state's electricity crisis. Southern California Edison (SoCal), a unit of=20
Edison International , is trying to avoid the same fate.=20
Wagner said if the talks were not successful by July 9, he would make a=20
recommendation on refunds and non-payment issues to FERC's five=20
commissioners.=20
FERC previously ordered about $124 million in refunds for overcharges during=

January and February.=20
Last week, FERC expanded a "price mitigation" plan to all 11 Western states=20
to curb runaway wholesale prices. The plan fell short of the strict price=20
