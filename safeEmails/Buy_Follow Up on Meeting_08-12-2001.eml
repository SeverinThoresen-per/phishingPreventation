Lyn- I was good to meet with you on Thursday. Its amazing how similar our is=
sues are and the approaches we use to address them. I spoke with my wife and=
 we concluded it is probably a great idea to pursue something outside of Enr=
on so I would definitely like to continue our discussions if you think appro=
priate. Look forward to talking to you further.

Thanks, Rick Buy
