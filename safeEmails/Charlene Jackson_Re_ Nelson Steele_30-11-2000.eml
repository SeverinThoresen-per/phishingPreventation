Bobbie,
We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.  Based=20
upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the=
=20
Analyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the=20
interview that Nelson had with them.  According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR=20
Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive. =20
Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When the=
y=20
called to tell him such, his response was, "that's OK because I did not want=
=20
to work there anyway."

I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring=
=20
him in if that is what is desired.  Please let me know how you wish for us t=
o=20
proceed.  Thanks.
Charlene
