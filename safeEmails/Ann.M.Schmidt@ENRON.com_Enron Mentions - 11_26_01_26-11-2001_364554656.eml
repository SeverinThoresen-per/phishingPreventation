Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. isn=
't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors ar=
e paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could barga=
in a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross=
-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10.8=
5 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agreemen=
t disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantial=
ly less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m. trad=
ing on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cents to =
$4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the per-share=
 takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under =
the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreemen=
t with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as so=
me specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, s=
eeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffere=
d a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that so=
me of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved ass=
ets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnerships. =
Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inve=
stigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "account=
ing error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since Oct. 16. =
At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the =
deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the two =
sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provisio=
ns "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy sharehold=
ers." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement.=20
Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material ad=
verse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger profession=
als this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the econ=
omic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisition=
s.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are co=
nsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctant =
to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and gro=
om often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envi=
sage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views th=
at a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-processi=
ng concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat-p=
acker IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IBP su=
bsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, saying =
Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the accoun=
ting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E.=
 Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company ha=
s suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operation=
s that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercially =
reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rather t=
han months."=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, prompt=
ing some transactions to include more details about circumstances under whic=
h deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a handfu=
l of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would q=
ualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change i=
s "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is i=
t just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acquis=
itions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that a co=
urt "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agreement =
disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eithe=
r side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a substan=
tially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In such =
a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dynegy an=
d its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation =
liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If those =
liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to have=
 occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In some =
situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that losse=
s arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material eve=
nt. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company faces =
more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by off=
icers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses=
=2E=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in Enr=
on's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself gi=
ve Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate its t=
erms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's wors=
ening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be difficu=
lt in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's frequen=
t statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, there is =
another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dynegy to te=
rminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of Enron shall have beco=
me untrue."=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stoc=
k prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of Tope=
ka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundreds =
of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utilities=
=2E The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its "duty of good faith =
and fair dealing" and said the New Mexico company tried to "sabotage" the de=
al as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies the ac=
cusations.

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to re=
cover from too much turkey and football.=20
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which =
measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor=
 sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session=
 the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money m=
anagers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor o=
ptimism.=20
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid =
victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Fede=
ral Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for severa=
l weeks following the attacks.=20
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strate=
gy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving an=
d December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied=
 volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outsi=
de the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. Toikka =
wrote in a recent research note.=20
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the te=
chnology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasd=
aq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.=20

More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open inter=

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in October=
, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at more =
than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chairman=
 David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling fo=
r more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company.=
 Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's pl=
anned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is ma=
king the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing busi=
ness. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy and =
Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, while Ch=
evronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operations, ener=
gy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's earnings. `=
`Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says analyst Ar=
jun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming =
a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping oil=
 at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Chevro=
n picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which sho=
uld balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene Nowak, =
an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have margi=
n improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and other Chev=
ronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stake=
 for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled thre=
e of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has sol=
d nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake has be=
en a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevron=
Texaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Reil=
ly to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a natura=
l-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finan=
ces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat b=
ack and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher crosst=
own rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garnerin=
g most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, CE=
O, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay di=
dn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and the c=
ompany faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic answer =
could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown H=
ouston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of coff=
ee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 p.m=
=2E that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy ann=
ounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 billi=
on in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key to th=
e deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up Enro=
n's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dynegy's 2=
6% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $10=
0 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says th=
at he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``I d=
on't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's been i=
ncredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet=
=2E If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts o=
f power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control a=
n estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading =
operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company t=
o guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has worke=
d furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, believi=
ng it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise t=
o tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and paper. IR=
RESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2000, hi=
gh of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It would have t=
aken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to match Enron's=
=2E Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commercial-serv=
ices unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as Wend=
y's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, says Steve=
 Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to get rid of th=
e $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, including the Portl=
and (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in India. For the $=
1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will have the right to=
 Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estimated $2.25 bill=
ion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billi=
on.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not =
a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operation=
 earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We look=
ed under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it was.=
''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting =
tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs tic=
king away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997=
 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial partners=
hips involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is stil=
l investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of weeks =
and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the necessar=
y due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities Inc. Dy=
negy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everything of ma=
terial consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive earnings boos=
t provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of course, regula=
tors may object to the concentration of trading operations. And Watson will =
have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for its intense, ev=
en cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are more conservati=
ve; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to issue new stock op=
tions to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It should help, too,=
 that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parachute he could have=
 received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a management job with the=
 new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online trading=
 and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclipse=
d Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit. ``=
Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been at t=
he forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Trident=
 NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year--he's =
a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his bold t=
akeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for good.

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do--=
and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20
With Mike McNamee in Washington

11/26/2001
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard =
to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After yea=
rs of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year, t=
he Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three=
 years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It was =
confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had annou=
nced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hideously c=
omplex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Management=
 pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to exclude the=
 results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion-d=
ollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's net worth.=
=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far shor=
t of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, but=
 it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge off =
a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory tha=
t aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if compa=
nies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those charges ca=
st doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue=
--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than th=
e fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If even t=
he most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company actual=
ly earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial markets hav=
e a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made the U.S=
=2E the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to in=
vest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporations. Tha=
t a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index=
 and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, could fall=
 so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished. ``The=
 profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' says Paul A=
=2E Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of the leade=
rs of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable d=
ecisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos re=
sults from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their =
own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors and an=
alysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variety of =
names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such version. B=
efore investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcement, its =
stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring net income=
'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to answer th=
e most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numbe=
rs reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are w=
oefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a compa=
ny's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts, and=
 even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone who use=
s GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. accounti=
ng expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of noncash=
 charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of those ch=
arges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of on=
going operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calcu=
lated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, comp=
arisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certainly =
not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says Har=
vey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC is ex=
amining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhap=
s restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and=
 a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, inve=
stors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited net-i=
ncome number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other. `=
`OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In early=
 November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying=
 operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting Standard=
s Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, would be tak=
ing up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standards Board=
 is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures ha=
s grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of h=
and,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnings =
are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to eva=
luate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, we bet=
ter all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gene=
rally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street i=
s only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in earni=
ngs per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10.78 =
according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First Call=
, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to the SEC=
 under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies.=
)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use =
First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively mo=
dest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers using G=
AAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating =
operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more or=
 less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with increa=
sed pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings=
 forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conventio=
nal measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. These cu=
stomized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed =
upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma formulas v=
ary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within t=
he same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, the gulf b=
etween net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&P's tallies=
 fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pro forma, but=
 they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investors are facing=
 a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of the American In=
stitute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired KPMG partner. =
``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter ende=
d on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three ear=
nings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the telecommu=
nications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possible p=
ro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' includi=
ng some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still better 27 c=
ents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges,'' suc=
h as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables. Wal=
l Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointin=
g out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a meas=
ure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal is =
to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those =
operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating e=
arnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity and so=
me reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, as compa=
nies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and investo=
rs are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion a=
sset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Near=
 the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif.) =
maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor SDL =
Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its assets =
ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS and ot=
her fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions into line=
 with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Despite the =
fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involve=
d no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net income. S=
o according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year ending in June-=
-a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years a=
dded up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-o=
ff was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of h=
and. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion charg=
e. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to descri=
be what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R. Mul=
ler, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Analysts m=
ake a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business is going=
 to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers analyst=
 Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic--a fair g=
auge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investors to judg=
e. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to eliminate. =
In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings.=
 Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs of purchases=
, research and development, restructuring costs (including severance), write=
-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company of stock options=
=2E It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairment of goodwill=
, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differen=
ce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group i=
ncluded in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using GAAP=
, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the compa=
ny put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cents.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the Fi=
nancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman Ed=
mund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investors =
shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends to b=
e glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In 1996=
, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring charges ha=
d some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. In June=
, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked for commen=
ts, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it still was=
n't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off another wave=
 of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new rules.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden c=
hanges in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks=
 on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rules =
for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told compan=
ies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So GAAP=
 earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company's ge=
neral performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out i=
n their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shaping=
 up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating after=
effects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are =
unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a growing=
 concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide miss=
teps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time charges. T=
he temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while investo=
rs are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterday's err=
ors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a charg=
e so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to dist=
ort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall into =
a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructuring=
 a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchase=
d, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inventory t=
hat has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School professo=
r Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charg=
es unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro fo=
rma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part o=
f the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings history=
=2E They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real sh=
areholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the Pr=
udent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so far =
this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it was,=
 a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. Whate=
ver the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareholders=
=2E'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings can ob=
scure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate operating e=
arnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible =
light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, tails yo=
u lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains in its v=
enture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its repor=
ted earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement=
=2E But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer maker iss=
ued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell spokesman M=
ichael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings break out inv=
estment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In our view, th=
e numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out there for the c=
onsuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special charges are a =
sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should investors make of a =
company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in the first and thi=
rd quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.12 billion, or abo=
ut $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999, and 2000 combined.=
 Which is the truer picture of its performance and potential? The write-offs=
 or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are another example. Whe=
n Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $767 mil=
lion in September, it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past t=
o companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating its performance in thos=
e earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking sales and accounting for=
 credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame the sharp downturn in the=
ir industry for the big write-offs. And these aren't isolated examples. Pete=
r L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economics & Portfolio Strategy, foun=
d that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanished into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that ex=
cess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnings=
 can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or char=
ges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for most co=
mpanies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in =
future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings. R=
ules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area that wi=
ll always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite a certa=
in amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they can in t=
he next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' says Robert=
 G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them=
 off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poise=
d for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge of =
$571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared with=
 a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for e=
xample, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, informa=
tion-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could depres=
s future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the Ster=
n School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-time eve=
nts?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, Morgan=
 Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that in the =
year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperformed th=
e stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors are apt to=
 be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy doesn't c=
ontinue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that changes the w=
ay companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that reflects the a=
mount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets. Und=
er the new rule, companies will have to assess their properties periodically=
 and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls. An info=
rmal survey by Financial Executives International of its member controllers =
and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charg=
es.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless th=
ere is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, val=
uing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. ``W=
hat this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming =
up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Professor =
Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings game=
s, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the dot=
-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate inv=
estment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``fund=
s from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to plai=
n old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB Prope=
rty Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FFO is ve=
ry simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than another=
 one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and res=
tore GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanley=
, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income fr=
om operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens says =
companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear=
 on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their press=
 releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma n=
umbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see numbe=
rs floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment of=
 unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no question is=
 more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin o=
n
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP=
).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securities=
 &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelat=
ed
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it =
is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings are
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometimes
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on interna=
l
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of=
 a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values=
=2E
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down =
a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs and
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cost
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can ev=
er ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years =
depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron Corp=
=2E just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstate=
d by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the New=
 York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without auditors,=
 analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek included) =
discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rule=
s and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Corporate=
 America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear pi=
cture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial reporting, th=
e U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global ma=
rketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something serious=
ly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business mod=
el customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses i=
n order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Street co=
nspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the method of=
 calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from qu=
arter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GAA=
P, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-time=
 expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing oper=
ations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are=
 no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The result i=
s total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 500-sto=
ck index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call standard=
s, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAAP. How c=
an investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. I=
t has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings an=
d relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agency S=
tandard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek) is=
 doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating earning=
s'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedowns from=
 ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merger and a=
cquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill, and gai=
ns or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should build on. =
The accounting anarchy has to end.

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $500=
m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown a=
t the energy trading group.=20
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's surviva=
l, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron's =
operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained "optimistic for the potential of the merger to be co=
mpleted, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine months"=
=2E=20
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dyn=
egy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the group'=
s debt while the deal is pending.=20
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enron=
 by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A furth=
er $500m is being sought from private equity firms.=20
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeopa=
rdy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering de=
bt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicle=
s linked to Enron.=20
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity fro=
m new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.=20
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fel=

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many =
investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has s=
hown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, experts=
 say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep th=
eir wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive of=
 Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokerage=
 firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mistakes=
 they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thin=
k is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's perce=
ptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, the=
 risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing in=
 stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctuatio=
ns]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Over=
 a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty dar=
ned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock an i=
nvestor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? Th=
at because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afghan=
istan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in the=
 markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. We=
 were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thing =
is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this count=
ry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and the st=
rength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've ha=
d many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about all=
 these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pretty =
easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't get be=
tter until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully befo=
re the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resource=
 and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past t=
wo or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn'=
t use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After Se=
pt. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going =
to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles of =
fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "This i=
s still the time to invest."=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don'=
t want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that people=
 should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poste=
r child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] whe=
n I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's too =
late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1billi=

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors fo=
r an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries to=
 avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt D=
ynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is v=
alued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but wouldn=
't divulge details. "We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we a=
re talking to," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading sessions=
 on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the sto=
ck sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in the a=
cquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go th=
rough as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blackston=
e Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry ana=

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further rev=
iew of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy t=
he company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, "remained optimistic for the potential of the merger to=
 be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine m=
onths," the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will proceed=
 only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and c=
redit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from these=
 two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron con=
tinues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a g=
reater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price fel=
l following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of =
a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share price =
from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegotiat=
ing its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market val=
ue of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unnamed=
 sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash infu=
sion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could the=
n downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the repor=
t said.=20

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Aditya Birla Group on Monday denied local me=
dia reports that said it is considering acquiring U.S. energy company Enron =
Corp.'s (ENE) stake in Dabhol Power Co.=20
"I have checked with our directors and can tell you that the Aditya Birla Gr=

Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power plant located in Maharashtra state.=20

The Enron scandal

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk=
 management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and had =
very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of mana=
gement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclosur=
e of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over a p=
eriod of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its share =
value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) inves=
tigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest reports cre=
ate some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, E=
nron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsewhe=
re it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance and =
general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures would ma=
ke an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, witho=
ut much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 bil=
lion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, the c=
harge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launched an=
 investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly involved=
 with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other senior=
 officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, reduc=
ing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar=
 amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tra=
ding, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These comprise=
d private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was ke=
pt artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To thi=
s end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itse=
lf, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed threshol=
d(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and m=
itigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations includi=
ng J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suffer=
ed on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid this an=
d, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creative acc=
ounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over th=
e rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the =
company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million as=
 audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the En=
ron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit that =
at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, bala=
nce sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out, =
but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billio=
n) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warrant=
=2E But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacke=
d transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was a=
lways somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity a=
nalysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading =
and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aware=
 of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management aggress=
ively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the s=
pirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the universe" did=
, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron m=
anagement itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity =
of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that "we=
 are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We a=
re bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world." (The quot=
ation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious e=
xit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "E=
nron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial techn=
ologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to trading i=
n power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not=
 led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, bet=
ween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse i=
n a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget =
this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether in th=
e bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed ob=
viously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little=
 bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

--Gautam Chakravorthy in the Mumbai newsroom (91-22) 233-9027
