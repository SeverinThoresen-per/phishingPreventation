Hi Jon,

Enron currently markets about 4.5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way=
 of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day.
I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12b=
cf a day that the NIT number can  easily be double this. It doesn't appear t=
hat Enron markets 50% of Alberta's gas each day...yet. =20

I hope this answers your question, let me know if you need anything else.

Ian =20

Start with Peggy Hedstrom and find out if this is accurate and get back to m=
e.

Thanks,

Jon

Jon
We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in T=
oronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in =
Alberta.=20
1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
2.  Can we publically make this representation? =20

Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your anal=
ysts puts together for the morning meeting?=20

Many thanks
Kate
