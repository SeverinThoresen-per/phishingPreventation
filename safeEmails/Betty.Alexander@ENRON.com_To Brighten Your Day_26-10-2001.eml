Dear Ken -

Please don't be heartbroken about the value of anyone's portfolio or stand i=
n line to beat yourself up about it (again). =20
 =20
Contrary to popular opinion, there is nothing that Enron executives or Wall =
Street analysts can do to ruin anyone's future.  The "portfolio problem" is =
not loss of value, rather lack of values--people need to get some personal v=
alues that are worth a damn! =20

I know our current scenario wasn't a part of your vision for Enron, but stoc=
kholder anxiety just shows that most people are spiritual morons.  God promi=
ses to take care of each and every one of us under absolutely every circumst=
ance.  People choose to ignore this; in doing so, they reject His blessings =
in favor of their own worries.  So be it.=20

You are not responsible for how we (stockholders) choose to react/respond to=
 life's exigencies.  Certainly we might wish you had "chosen vanilla," but n=
o financial loss is appropriate cause for anyone to feel devastated and come=
 whining to you.  So we're down a few $ billion - this is so piddling!  God =
has "umpty-zillion" in money + much more important stuff to make up this per=
ceived loss.  =20

I sincerely hope you can find some comfort in these thoughts. =20

Betty

P.S.
I am very grateful for your staying with us; I know the going is extremely t=
ough for you these days.
