This confirms that EPMI Real Time will be selling 4 MW at NP-15 to Wheelabra=
tor Martell and reducing the generation pre-schedule from 13 MW to 9 MW effe=
ctive HE 17 on 9/25 through HE12 on 9/26.  We expect that Martell might need=

 will call Stan or me tomorrow to clarify exactly which hours are needed.  A=
fter this event Dave can call Stan  to obtain info on the price paid.
