I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe that=
 person could shed light on this for both of us.=20

There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the =
name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn't =
match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if that=
 is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who wor=
ks for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC name th=
at was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously seem t=
o relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported in thro=
ugh Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employees in tha=
t RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we had not use=
d the term "IBS" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be consisten=
t with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes sense and sh=
e said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a name change=
, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this info gets us bac=
k on the right track.  --Sally=20

I understand that you requested that a separate Cost Center be set up for th=
e Calgary Risk group.  Any special reason?  Do I need to set up separate Cos=
t Centers for the rest of my departments? =20
