I've started to transfer my Dow Jones e-mails into five separate folders=20
which can be found at:

P:\Scheduling\Dow Jones - Cob\Mead\Mid-C\NP-SP\Palo=20

You can already access February's files for each of these delivery points,=20
and prior months will be coming in soon as I have free moments in the day.

Thanks,
Kate

Here's what I heard back from Tim. Do you want me to go ahead and save the=20
Dow Jones data to a shareable file in the meantime?

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our=20
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the=
=20
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski get=

back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the=20
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being=
=20
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue=20
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several=20
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests=20
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put=20
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on th=
e=20
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your=20
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your=
=20
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow=20
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the=20
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile=
=20
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you=
=2E=20
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate
