We're looking at this as we speak, along with the PRC.  Don't want to repeat=
 the nightmare.

I want to put as much discretion as possible in the hands of the business un=
its.  The "strawman" we're looking at would have a very basic matrix, with a=
 discretionary business unit component (that really gives the OTC's the free=
dom to do what they want). =20

I think we need the basic matrix to avoid EEOC problems, and to not drive a/=
a's toward wanting to work in just one part of the organization.

I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way.=20

I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise.

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing t=
he standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last =
years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its approp=
riate to go with the nightmare from last year.
