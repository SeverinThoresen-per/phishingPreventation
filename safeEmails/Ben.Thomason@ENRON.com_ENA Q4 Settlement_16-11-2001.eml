Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Financ=
e in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on th=
e ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500M=
M.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting gr=
oup, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was=
 more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for fur=
ther insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about tha=
t settlement?

Thanks,
Ben
