Their attorney finally contacted me and we talked about the ESP rules.  She=20
is going to do further research in light of the fact that for regulatory=20
purposes Utilicorp, the GP, cannot furnish a Guaranty.  I alos mentioned to=20
her that at the very least we would like to make Utilicorp a "Specified=20
Entity" so that they would be part of the credit-related Events of Default i=
n=20
the ISDA Master.  As a general rule, we recommend in circumstances where the=
=20
counterparty is an LP and you are relying on the GP's credit, making the GP =
a=20
"Specified Entity" so that for example their bankruptcy would trigger an=20
Event of Default.  Call me if you have any questions.
