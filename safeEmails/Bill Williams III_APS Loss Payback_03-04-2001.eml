I have scheduled a loss payback to APS of 5 mws from EPE for HE 23,24 MDT an=
d=20

mws.  All mws are delivered to APS at PV.  The Enpower deals are:#569111,=20
569126 buy from EPE -please input price, and #569116, 569129 sell to APS at=20
zero.  Prices need to be corrected for the purchase from EPE.  The deals are=

Thanks,
