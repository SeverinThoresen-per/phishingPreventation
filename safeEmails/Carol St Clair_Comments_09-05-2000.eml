Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the S&P rating; (2) we provide =

cure concept that the non-Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3)=20
we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have=20
included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership=20
agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we=20
traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that=20
still the case?  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need=20
some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GP's liability that is=20

further about it?

Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks=
