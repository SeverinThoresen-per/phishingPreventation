My first official involvement (along with Chip)  was a meeting with Brad Ric=
hter on 5/23 to discuss the strategy and valuation approach.  This was the E=
BS' structuring teams introduction as well.   The model that Lehman had prep=
ared only looked at the Managed Hosting business and had a number of questio=
nable assumptions that were pointed out to the corporate development team. =20

RAC did not prepare its own numbers.  I had more questions about strategy an=
d understanding the different parts of the transaction.

 RAC was not invited to the meeting with Skilling.

The transaction was being run by EBS Corporate Development - Jeff Donohue wa=
s heavily involved from the start of discussions with the company.  Brad Ric=
hter, who works for Donohue, was the day to day contact at the end.=20

I spoke briefly yesterday with Brad Richter who was going to put something m=
ore formal together.  I will send that to you when I have it.

Jeff and the commercial team had different opinions about the managed hostin=
g side of the business.  Part of EBS liked the technical capabilitiy of PSI =
Net and felt that this capability would allow EBS to run a managed hosting b=
usiness (basically outsourcing the operation of company web sites).  Jeff di=
d not like this business and had told EBS last week to not put any growth on=
 this part of the business in their analysis. =20

Without growth on the managed hosting part of the business, EBS needed to fi=
nd $100 million/year of benefit through the acquisition.  A large part of th=
is would have come from IP Transit which, due to its size, PSI Net would hav=
e received free through peering and which EBS currently pays for.  These sav=
ing depend a lot on hockey stick projections from EBS' current activities (a=
lthough MSN would provide a large portion of this savings).  The rest of the=
 benefit was to come through cross selling PSI Net's existing customers and =
new customers obtained due to the combination of their technical capability =
and Enron's financial capability.  This increased technical capability is di=
ametrically opposed to Project Reset (the sale of EBS' long haul network to =
Qwest in return for a series of options on capacity).

PSI Net wanted a quick decision and a purchase of the whole company through =
a packaged bankruptcy to try and maintain staff and customers.  I have heard=
 comments that they wanted Enron to purchase their consulting arm as well.  =
This group had approximately 1,000 people and held no particular interest to=
 EBS.  I do not know whether it was the speed of the transaction, the consul=
ting arm, the managed hosting business, or the increased technical direction=
 that killed the transaction.

The proposed purchase of PSI Net by EBS was officially killed by Skilling th=
