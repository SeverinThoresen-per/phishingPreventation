Jeff,

According to Kevin Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo's today to give a fin=
al blessing to the release.  He doesn't foresee any issues.  If they are ok =
with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person.  I will =
be in San Marcos this weekend.  Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well f=
or me.  He is proposing that time to the Kuo's.  How does your schedule look=
?  It would be nice to finally put this behind us.

Any word on a closing date for Leander?

Phillip
