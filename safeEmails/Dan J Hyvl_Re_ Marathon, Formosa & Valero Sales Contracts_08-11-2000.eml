Cheryl,
 Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired=20
10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I=20
may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed documen=
t.

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterda=
y:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term=
=20
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired=20
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The=20
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired=20
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't=20
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that=
=20
the File Room doesn't have anything either).

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517)=20
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95=20
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with=
=20
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is=
=20
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic=20
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything=
=20
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
____________________________________________________________________________=

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm)=20
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.
