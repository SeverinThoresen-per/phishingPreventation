I'll just continue to solicit feedback from Brett, Chris and Ben every two w=
eeks before we circulate the Turbine Report.  If a meeting is ever scheduled=
, I would have an interest participating.  Thanks.

WE haven't really had one yet.  The answer is simple - we are trying to sell=
 all of them and pushing as hard as possible.  No luck so far apart from Vir=
go selling the steam turbine.
