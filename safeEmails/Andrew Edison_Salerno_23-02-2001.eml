I just wanted to provide you with a quick update on this matter.  We sent a=20
demand letter to Salerno about a month ago, but have heard nothing. I have=20
made several calls to Salerno's Bob Lampo, but he will not return my calls. =
=20
Therefore, we are preparing a lawsuit, which we will file here in Houston.  =
I=20
have asked Britt Davis in the Enron Litigation Unit to prepare the lawsuit. =
=20
Alan, I have told Britt to give you a call if he has any questions.

Truth and justice will prevail.

Andy
