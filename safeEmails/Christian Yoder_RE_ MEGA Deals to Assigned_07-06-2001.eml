Carol,

I tried to contract Morgan yesterday but Debbie Hart said she would have to=20
call me back.  If I don't hear from here by noon, I will give her another=20
call.  Also, I am assuming that you will be handling adding the product=20

the case.

The following deal confirmations do not contain the product definitions for=20
SP-15 delivery (CAISO) and Palo Verde/Mid Columbia (West Firm)

226189 (SP15)
220051 (SP15)
220052 (SP15)
249547 (PV)
200536 (MidC)

Therefore, the amendment will need to contain the definition of CAISO Energy=
=20
and West Firm Energy.

To Rhonda,

My bad...It looks like MEGA is assigning ALL of its physical power positions=
=20
with EPMI to ENA.  The attached spreadsheet below has the options in the=20
lower section, which should really be part of the "to be assigned" group.

To All,

Sorry for the confusion,

Wendy

Please find attached a spreadsheet which matches up the MEGA Deals with the=20
EPMI deals to be assigned from MEGA to Morgan.  Please review deal numbers=20
for accuracy and then review the confirms to ensure that all necessary West=20
Product Definitions are either in the confirm.  If they are not in the=20
confirm, they need to be identified in the amendment to the Master Agreement=
=20
with Morgan.


Thanks,
Wendy
