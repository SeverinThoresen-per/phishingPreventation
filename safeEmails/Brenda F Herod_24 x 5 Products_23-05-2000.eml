We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek. =20
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend=20
delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of=20
logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

Let me know if you have further questions.

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow=
,=20
May 24th.=20

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas=20
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk i=
n=20
that the Product  description has an=20
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day=
=20
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,=20
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be=20
diligent to identify these Products based=20
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products ar=
e=20
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably -=20
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days=20
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these=20
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider=20
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low=
,=20
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.
