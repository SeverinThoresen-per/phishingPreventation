I just wanted to drop you a line to thank you so very much for the Rockets
tickets last Thursday.  My family and I had a great time.  My daughters
were saying that we were so close that they could see the sweat on Moochie
Norris' head.  Their school's basketball team played that afternoon in the
Compaq Center, so they were able to see a lot of their friends.  Their
friends were very jealous of the great seats that we had.

Thanks again ...
