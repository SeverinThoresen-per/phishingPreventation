I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.

I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!

Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893=20
from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes th=
e=20
AO6 they are buying from us).  Which means we should only have 3844 out of=20
the pool.


Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows

Vol Comment
3844 Out of the pool
25893 Other receipt supply
xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.
