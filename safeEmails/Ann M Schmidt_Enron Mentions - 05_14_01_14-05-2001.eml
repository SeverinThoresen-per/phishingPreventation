WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has=

"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have=

president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co.=20
Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included=

about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and=

staff.=20
No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarize=

the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered backgroun=

At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove=20

Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's=20
power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it=20
and possible solutions.=20
"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever=20

spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a=20
one-page memo."=20
Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been=20
studying the California problem almost daily.=20
At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in=20

Mineworkers Union.=20
White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage=20
lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was=20
permissible under federal law.=20
Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California=20
Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca=20
Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with=20
the renewable-energy industry this week.=20
Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving=20

of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose=20
holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a=20
major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to=20
Democrats.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because th=

contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricit=
y=20
transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new=20
transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he=20
said.=20
Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think=
=20
political donations played a role.=20
Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's=20
invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task=20

how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN

		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they =
can=20
rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective=20
demise are exaggerated.=20
		Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed=20
"independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing,=20
believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operatin=
g=20
in the North Sea 30 years ago.=20
		After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo,=
=20
there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Ye=
t=20
they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significan=
t=20
exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden.=20
		Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies i=
n=20
the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to=20
consortia with a local flavour.=20
		But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more=20
free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at th=
e=20
same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British=20
Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent=20
that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would b=
e=20
a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured=20
interest in taking it over.=20
		As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-bas=
ed=20
independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have=20
always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those=
=20
in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the=20
world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood.=20
		Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in=
=20
the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy,=20
dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake i=
n=20
the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m)=
=2E=20
		Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into=20
Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because=
=20
it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam=20
operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a=20
country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from=
=20
Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob=
=20
it of its Ukraine assets.=20
		Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energ=

now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would=
=20
be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest=

foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now =
a=20
substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and=20
Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore.=20
		But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concern=
s=20
Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its=20
presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would=
=20
carry on.=20
		The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to=
=20
Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are=20
"very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway=
=20
is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in=20
exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas=20
highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector".=
=20
		Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. I=
ts=20
goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap=20
exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development=20
stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end=20
of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oi=
l=20
or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no=20
bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings=20
overlooked by the majors.=20
		The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oi=
l=20
price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and=20
sellers.=20
		But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and =
is=20
this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is=20
selling off.=20
		As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company=

with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not=20
exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort=20

generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one.=20
"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value,"=20

MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is=
=20
expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15.=20
While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power=20

sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate=20

These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters=20
that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.=20
Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a=20
bout of slightly lower growth.=20
But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the=
=20
region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP=20
grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.
Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the=20
prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per=20
cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest=20
performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up=20
the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural=20
performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.=20
However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from=
=20
a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to=
=20
see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.=20
An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And=
,=20
they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move=
=2E=20
Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange=20
reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian=
=20
currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of=
=20
control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil=
=20
prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut=20
may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector,=
=20
stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.=20
Rain, rain, come again=20
For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP=20
level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year.=20
"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by=20
around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J=
=20
M Morgan Stanley Securities.=20
In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a=20
subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a=20
row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent=20
compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for=
=20
only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by=20
economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because=
=20
of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumptio=
n=20
side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research=
=20
Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,=
"=20
he adds.=20
More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on=20
agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for=20
everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like=20
tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good=20
monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.=20
In service of the economy=20
Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.=20
India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to=20
transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth=20
weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this=20
important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most=20
economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge=20
slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure tha=
t=20
overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry=20
numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it=
=20
will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan.=20
Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and=20
other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7=20
per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped t=
o=20
show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking=20
Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.=20
Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax=
=20
reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more=20
people to buy houses.=20
Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services,=20
says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the=
=20
world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing,=20
though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money=
=20
spinners in the years ahead.=20
The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment=
=2E=20
"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth=
=20
rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100=20
Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.=20
A good home show=20
And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the=20
gloom over its performance.=20
Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest=
=20
rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy=20
increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.=20
While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief i=
s=20
that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at=
=20
which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven=20
per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale=20
price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices=
=20
will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to=20
exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the=20
industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on=20
rural demand.=20
Neighbours' envy=20
And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact=20
of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to=20
remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are=20
less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to=20
shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian=20
nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.=20
With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is=20
clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GD=
P=20
comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the=20
Philippines.=20
Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports=20
remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 2=
0=20
per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of=20
good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same=20
period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per=20
cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion fro=
m=20
$12.79 billion the previous year.=20
Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American=20
slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, =
a=20
quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 7=
0=20
per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important=20
software exports destination.=20
Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living=20
overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on=20
India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic=20
turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill=20
threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from=20
invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to=
=20
the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.=20
It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of=20
Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to=20
between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.=
=20
Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion fro=
m=20
$6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression.=20
"They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and=
=20
not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive=20
officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to=20
maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who=20
live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,"=20
says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months=20
to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same=20
period.=20
Foreign institutions support=20
Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.=20
Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India'=
s=20
equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in th=
e=20
whole of calendar 2000.=20
Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months,=20
investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and=20
seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios,=
=20
some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.=
=20
Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see=20
India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band.=20
Yet some hesitation=20
Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government=20
opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including=20
pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However,=20
tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India.=20
In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the=20
previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently=20
compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in=20
the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start=20
investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain=20
stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house.=20
The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have=
=20
many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic=20
infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often=20
left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India.=20
The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring=20
concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power=20
project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power=20
supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines=
=20
once again.=20
This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay=20
its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its=20
commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation=20
that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply=
=20
pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till=
=20
recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India.=20
It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign=
=20
investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had=20
also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing=20
endless bureaucratic hurdles.=20
And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300=20
million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many=20
international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up=20
operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling t=
o=20
break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for=20
success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors,=20
India still remains a tough sell.=20
Outlook=20
With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six=
