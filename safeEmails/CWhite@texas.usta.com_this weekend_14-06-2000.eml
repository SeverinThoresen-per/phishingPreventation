Hi, Sal.   Just thinking about the weekend . . .  Any ideas for what we
should do?  Is there a fun place to go to dinner on Saturday?   Sunday is
Father's Day - are you going to want to go to church? (should we bring
clothes?)     Last time I visited you, I decided I would keep the Houston
directions somewhere - but, of course, I don't know where that is.   So,
could you send me directions yet one more time?  THanks!    Love, Cara
