David:
Here is the extent to what I think we can agree to:

1. At the end of Section 4(b) we can say "unless such access, entry, omissio=
n=20
or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers=
,=20
employees, agents or contractors''.  What this does is not make them=20
responsible for losses we incur as a result of our own actions.  To the=20
extent that we suffer losses because of a third party claim brought against=20
us and such claim is not as a result of actions on our part, their indemnity=
=20
should cover this.

2. In Section 6(c), we could say, "Except as otherwise provided in Section=20
4(b)"

Hope this helps.
