Daren,

I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation clos=
e=20
week for Volume Management.

98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30=20
decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate=20
2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000=20
production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I=20
see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the=20
ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled=20
differently. =20

98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K=20
applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal=20
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has=20
the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen=20
flag or a new deal number). =20

Thanks
