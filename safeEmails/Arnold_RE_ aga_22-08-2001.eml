hard to say odds on a revision.  don't think aga would make a revision, but =
an individual stg field could.  another option is that a stg field that real=
izes they fucked up just fades the number over the next several weeks such t=
hat each number going forward is bigger than expected. =20

the other thing in the back of my mind-if there is a revision of 20 bcf or
more and an injection of 80 ish-i think they kill this thing. what you think
are the odds of a revision? 10-15% i say. not sure when tho

With skilling gone I move up one spot...from 147th to 146th.

This market sucks!!  Right back where we were before the # last week.  I
have so little interest right now.  just glad i held onto the short
straddle position.  wish i had something intelligent to say but i don't.
