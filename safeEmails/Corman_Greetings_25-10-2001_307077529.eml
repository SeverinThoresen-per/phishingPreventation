Hi Mom,

Chad just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.

I am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma=
, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch o=
f bronchitis or something.

I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily,=
 I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list=
=2E  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be =
traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal=
 questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide th=
is list:

Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyon=
e asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than=
 $20)

-Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)
-Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)
-Harry Potter Trading Cards
-Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"
-Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)
-Ultra Grip Nerf Football

Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitat=
ing Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.


More Later

Shelley
