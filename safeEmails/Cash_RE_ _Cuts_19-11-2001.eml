Lance,

Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumo=
r mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!

I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts ar=
e based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have=
=2E  =20

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for business=
es to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed =
on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to=
 be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform se=
veral different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and=
 historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be t=
he sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to =
do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lowe=
r at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.

Michelle

Lance,

  I have been told that all cuts will be based on PRC.  Kristina Mordaunt wa=
s my last reviewer and I have serious doubts about the fairness of her revie=
w.  If this becomes an issue, I would appreciate it if you would talk to Pau=
l Racicot and Jim Fallon about the quality of my performance at EBS.  Thanks
