As I reviewed the original request, I realised that I did not correctly=20
reference the original $15MM guaranty.  The request was for Exxon Mobil=20
Corporation.  Please proceed without further delay from Credit.  I apologise=
=20
for any inconvenience this may have caused.

thanks

sign the amendment.  Please prepare it and forward for the appropriate Enron=

signatures and then have it forwarded it to me, so that I might forward it=20
along to Trevor Mihalik who can in turn forward it along to Texaco for final=
