We received two financing commitment letters from Hancock.  In general, the =
letters are good and suggest that Hancock is genuinely in the deal, but they=
 include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals.  C=
hip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get Hancock to call=
 Ben Glisan to assure us that they are in (Hancock wants a lot of future bus=
iness from Enron).  In the meantime, we are innovatively stalling GE by requ=
iring some consent language up front so we get another day from them.  I thi=
nk we will get both sides of this trade done.
