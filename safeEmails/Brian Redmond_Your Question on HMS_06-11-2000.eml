Dr. Lay:

As you know, Enron owns a minority interest in Hanover Compressor Corp.   On=
=20
several ocassions, Mel Klein of GKH has discussed the possibility that Enron=
=20
purchase GKH's interest in Hanover.  This is an option that ENA has not=20
recommended to date, as I understand that at current prices we are more of a=
=20
seller than a buyer.  Jeff Donahue is responsible for this investment and ca=
n=20
answer any specific questions.

In respect to HMS,  Enron and Hanover established Hanover Measurement=20
Services (HMS) as a joint venture to provide pipeline measurement services. =
=20
HMS is structured as an (Enron:Hanover)  49:51 equity and 50:50 control=20
partnership.  Enron and Hanover each have 2 representatives on the Board.

Enron (through Houston Pipe Line)  invested $2.5MM of initial capital in HMS=
=20
and entered into a measurement service contract with HMS.  HMS has also=20
entered into a service contract with Kinder Morgan and is seeking to enter=20
into similar contracts with other pipelines. =20

Potential HMS Topics of Discussion

1. Enron is in the processing of selling HPL - the service contract between=20
HPL and HMS will be assigned to the  purchaser of HPL. =20

2. Enron will retain its interest in HMS, but we are open to both Enron and=20
Hanover selling a portion of our equity to a new pipeline/producer customer.

Brian
