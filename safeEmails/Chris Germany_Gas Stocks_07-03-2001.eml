Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued=20
2001-02-25
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer

Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock.=20
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up=
=20
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded=20
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued.=20
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were=20
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company=
=20
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy=20
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings.=
=20
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive=20
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The=20
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the=20
most undervalued."=20
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the=20
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of=20
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker.=20
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it=
=20
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that=
=20
Chesapeake does.=20
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts.=20
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his=20
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until=
=20
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly=20
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after=20
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market=20
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent.=20
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets.=20
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32=20
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas.=20
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much=20
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon.=20
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers=20
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is=
=20
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percen=
t=20
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001.=20
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have=
=20
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would=
=20
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to=
=20
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly=20
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more."=20
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic.=20
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come=20
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long,=20
long time."=20
