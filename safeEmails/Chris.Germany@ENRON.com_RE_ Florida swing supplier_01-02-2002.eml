Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy =
gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't t=
hink PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell =
different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling the=
m first thing this morning. =20

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing g=
as for the weekend.=20

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply th=
e City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative bur=
den and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott=
 Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become ou=
r new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the f=
ollowing conditions,=20
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily v=
olumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify EN=
A until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.
