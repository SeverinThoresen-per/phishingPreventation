Please review and let me know if you would like me to change anything you ar=
e not comfortable with before I send out to Virginia Power. (I am still wait=
ing on the cities from Gas Control). Jo, you wanted me to get the Plainview =
South number from planning but see if the way I worded the reponse works.  I=
 will get back to him separately on the fuel language response.

Thanks!
