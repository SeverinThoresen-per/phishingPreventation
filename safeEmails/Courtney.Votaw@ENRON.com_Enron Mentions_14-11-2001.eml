NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- IntercontinentalExchange, an Internet-based energy an=

ICE's volume of North American bulk power trades last week totaled a record =
54 million megawatt-hours, a 34% increase over the October weekly average. N=

Fitch Dwngr Portland General Electric; On Rtg Watch Evolving

11/13/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 13, 2001--Fitch has lowered Portland General=
 Electric Co.'s (PGE) securities as follows: senior secured debt to 'BBB+' f=
rom 'A'; senior unsecured debt to 'BBB' from 'A-'; preferred stock to 'BBB-'=
 from 'BBB+'. The Rating Watch status has been revised to Evolving from Nega=
tive for all intermediate- to long-term securities. A Rating Watch Evolving =
means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. PGE's commercial pap=
er has been downgraded to 'F2' from 'F1', with a Stable Outlook.=20
The downgrades for PGE reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent=
, Enron (ENE). ENE's senior unsecured debt is rated 'BBB-', with a Rating Wa=
tch Evolving. ENE's financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a re=
sult of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structur=
ed transactions. On Oct. 16, 2001, ENE announced a $1 billion after tax char=
ge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $1.2 billion reduction to balance sh=
eet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions. In addition=
, the company has restated its financial results for the 1997-2000 period, i=
ncorporating off-balance sheet entries related to the structured transaction=
s and is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investiga=
tion focusing on the company's accounting for the partnerships.
These events badly eroded investor confidence in the company, effectively bl=
ocking its ability to access capital markets, and forcing management to seek=
 a corporate suitor. On Nov. 9, 2001, Dynegy (DYN) announced that it reached=
 a definitive agreement to acquire ENE in a stock-for-stock transaction unde=
r which ENE shareholders will receive a fixed amount of DYN shares. The prop=
osed DYN transaction will provide significant financial support to ENE, and =
should enable ENE to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 u=
nder expected business conditions, despite ENE's significant refinancing ris=
k. The merger requires regulatory approvals, including Hart-Scott-Rodino, th=
e SEC, and the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission; assuming regulators app=
rove the merger, we would expect the transaction to close in six- to nine-mo=
nths. The merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an eleme=
nt of uncertainty to its completion. Fitch anticipates that the surviving co=
mpany's rating would move to the mid-'BBB' range assuming the successful exe=
cution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the complet=
ion of the merger. If the merger were terminated Fitch believes ENE's abilit=
y to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to down=
grade its securities to highly speculative levels.=20
PGE's new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile, the p=
rospective regulatory ring-fencing required by Oregon regulators, and the pe=
nding sale of PGE to Northwestern Natural Gas (NWN), in addition to its inte=
rim status as a subsidiary of ENE. The Evolving status for PGE recognizes th=
at its ratings could drop if the ENE/DYN merger were terminated, or improve,=
 if ENE's credit rating is upgraded in the future.=20
PGE's credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporari=
ly weaken in 2001, reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high=
 wholesale power costs. In August 2001, the Oregon Public Utility Commission=
 (OPUC) authorized higher PGE rates, effective October 1, 2001, to recover s=
uch costs. Importantly, the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment=
 mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion's share of i=
ts power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future. The=
 cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the OPUC order, combine=
d with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this =
year should alleviate financial pressure at PGE and facilitate improving cre=
dit measures in 2002.=20
The PGE ratings consider Fitch's assessment of NWN's acquisition funding pla=
n and the anticipated post-merger holding company structure. NWN recently an=
nounced an agreement to acquire PGE from ENE in a transaction valued at $2.9=
 billion, including the assumption of $1.1 billion of PGE debt. The transact=
ion is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory =
approvals, including the SEC, the OPUC, and the Washington Utilities and Tra=
nsportation Commission. As part of the transaction, NWN expects to form a ne=
w holding company (HoldCo), which will raise the new debt and equity require=
d to complete the purchase of PGE. Post-merger, PGE and NWN will operate as =
wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of HoldCo. As currently contemplated, t=
he approximate $1.8 billion cash portion will be funded at HoldCo with appro=
ximately 78% debt and 22% common equity and hybrid convertible preferred sto=
ck. As a result, HoldCo's consolidated and individual credit measures are ex=
pected to be relatively weak, as consolidated debt to capitalization could r=
each 75% at closing.=20
PGE's ultimate post-merger ratings will depend on several factors, including=
, the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with NWN, the=
 credit ratings Fitch assigns to HoldCo, and the structural protections prov=
ided PGE investors by state utility regulators. The current regulatory ring-=
fencing applied by the OPUC requires PGE to maintain a 48% common equity rat=
io, thereby limiting the amount of cash PGE can dividend up to its parent co=
mpany. It is expected that similar ring-fencing from the OPUC will continue =
under the new HoldCo structure.

"Nymex coal is cheap, but no one is buying," one market watcher said.=20
Another coal trader attributed the inactivity to companies' unwillingness to=

Dynegy Deal Sets Path Of Resolution For Enron - Analyst
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/13/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) proposed acquisition of Enron Cor=
p. (ENE) "creates a clear path for the resolution" of the liquidity and fina=
ncial issues plaguing Enron, said Ted Izatt, a high-grade debt research anal=
yst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH).=20
Izatt made the comments during a conference call held Tuesday with bondholde=
rs to discuss the proposed acquisition, which was announced late last Friday=
=2E=20
Lehman's investment bankers advised Dynegy on the transaction. Enron was adv=
ised by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C).
On Monday, the marriage of the two Houston energy traders received a warm re=
ception as equity investors bid up shares of both companies.=20
Recently, Enron shares traded at $9.25, up 1 cent, or 0.2%, while Dynegy sha=
res changed hands at $45.00, up 69 cents, up 1.6%.=20
Enron shares had fallen more than 80% in the weeks leading up to the transac=
tion as the company posted more than $1 billion in write-offs of failed inve=
stments and was forced to restate its earnings going back to 1997 because it=
 improperly accounted for the results at some of its partnerships. The resta=
tement reduced Enron's profits over the period by 20% and added millions to =
its debt level. Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inv=
estigation of the financial dealings of Enron's former chief financial offic=
er, Andrew Fastow.=20
The chain of events prompted a series of credit rating downgrades and raised=
 doubts about Enron's liquidity. Eventually, the concerns threatened Enron's=
 core energy marketing and trading business because a perception of creditwo=
rthiness is vital to the business.=20
Izatt said a combination of $1 billion in newly secured bank lines and the $=
1.5 billion equity infusion from Dynegy has bolstered Enron's financial posi=
tion.=20
With this additional cash on hand, the greatest risk to bondholders is wheth=
er the deal closes, said Izatt.=20
The analyst added he expects the merger to close because both companies are =
committed to the deal, and he expects regulators to approve the transaction.=
=20
"There is a lot of commitment to get the deal done," he said.=20
However, if the transaction doesn't close, Izatt said he believes Dynegy's b=
ondholders are "very well protected" in the transaction.=20
According to Izatt, Dynegy's bonds are at an "attractive level." The spread =
on the bonds had widened ahead of the announcement of the deal as rumors beg=
an to leak into the market, leaving the price of the bond in a weaker positi=
on.=20
But Izatt does expect Dynegy will merge with Enron, and the resulting compan=
y will emerge as a "much stronger company," he said.=20
For example, the analyst expects Dynegy has the potential to achieve more th=
an $400 million to $500 million in pretax, merger cost savings Dynegy is pro=
jecting.=20
Also, Izatt said Dynegy's cash infusion and purchase will help Enron to reta=
in its position in the energy market.=20
"Dynegy is there for real," Izatt said. "They intend to see this through to =
fruition and energy players will view this and (feel confident enough to tra=
de with Enron.)"=20
Under terms of the acquisition, Dynegy will pay Enron shareholders 0.2685 of=
 a Dynegy share for each Enron share outstanding. The value of the stock swa=
p at the close of the market Monday was $10.12 billion.=20
Dynegy is making an immediate cash investment in Enron with the assistance o=
f ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX). Later, when the deal closes, ChevronTexaco will=
 make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company.=20

INTERVIEW: Dynegy To Continue Asset Push In Europe
By Sarah Wachter
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Even before Enron's (ENE) financial woes were made publi=
c, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) was discussing ways of beefing up its European operatio=
ns by consolidating with a U.S. company such as Enron.=20
Dynegy Europe Ltd. CEO, Gary Cardone, told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday from =
the company's European headquarters in London: "We floated the Enron balloon=
 about six to eight weeks ago." Enron was one of a couple of U.S. companies =
Dynegy was considering at the time for a merger of technology and assets in =
Europe. Houston-based Dynegy plans to buy Enron Corp. in a stock swap worth =
close to $10.12 billion.
In Europe, the deal is tantamount to a grasshopper swallowing a sow. Enron h=
as a huge regional presence, while Dynegy is small by comparison, and tradin=
g is focused on the U.K. Enron has close to 5,400 employees and 28 offices i=
n Europe. Dynegy has 150 people in five locations. Enron owns or manages 4,3=
74 megawatts of power production and also owns Wessex Water in southwest Eng=
land. Dynegy doesn't own or operate power plants, although this year it did =
acquire its first big European asset, BG Storage Ltd., from BG Gas Group PLC=
 for $590 million.=20
The most important synergy Dynegy will get by acquiring Enron is to catapult=
 Dynegy's trading presence - in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Scand=
inavian countries, boosting wholesale trading and expanding Dynegy's scope i=
n the retail market.=20
But the deal hasn't curbed Dynegy's appetite for bidding on power generation=
 assets, or from seeking other partners, Cardone said.=20
"We'll continue to pursue joint ventures and acquisitions, where appropriate=
," he said, naming Italy, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands as key expansio=
n areas. Dynegy is widely expected to make the short list of bidders for Eur=
ogen, Italian utility Enel's next and largest tranche of power generation as=
sets for sale.=20
Cardone added that assets are for sale in the Netherlands. He also expects p=
ower assets to come on the block in the next 18 months in Germany. A new Ger=
man power company, Neue Kraft is in the midst of forming, and is seeking par=
tners.=20
While Dynegy's European CEO said it's too soon to discuss the details of how=
 Enron and Dynegy will merge their European operations, one area he said was=
 ripe for consolidation will be the two group's commercial offices. Dynegy a=
nd Enron each have offices in Madrid, London, Milan and in Switzerland.=20
But once the deal is done and dusted, Dynegy expects the combined group to c=
onquer a sizable slice of the European Union gas and power markets, which ar=
e gradually deregulating and where trading is starting to develop on the Con=
tinent.=20
"Europe is the next growth engine, with $400 billion in electricity and natu=

UK: INTERVIEW-U.S. Dynegy still hungry for assets in Europe.
By Stuart Penson

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Dynegy wants to buy power stati=
ons in Europe as it looks to underpin an energy trading business boosted bey=
ond recognition by its audacious takeover of stricken American rival Enron .=
=20
Dynegy Europe's president and chief executive officer Gary Cardone said his =
company would retain its strategy of backing wholesale energy trading with p=
hysical assets, rather than adopting Enron's "pure trading" approach to Euro=
pean energy markets.
"This will be an asset-backed trading business coupled with (Enron's) market=
-making capabilities," he told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.=20
"Our approach has been different (to Enron's)," he added. "They have believe=
d in pure trading. We have believed in a very disciplined approach to assets=
," he added.=20
Dynegy has agreed to buy its bigger rival Enron in a $9 billion rescue deal.=
=20
The deal, announced last week, came after Enron suffered a share-price colla=
pse and damaging credit downgrades triggered by a regulatory probe into off-=
balance sheet dealings.=20
Cardone said he considered Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium as attr=
active hunting grounds for assets, though he said Dynegy would remain a caut=
ious buyer.=20
Some new entrants to Europe's liberalising energy markets had overpaid for a=
ssets in recent deals, he said.=20
Cardone declined to comment on speculation that Dynegy was a bidder for two =
power stations in Britain, bought last month for $960 million by U.S. group =
American Electric Power Co. .=20
Earlier this year Dynegy agreed to buy the gas storage business of Britain's=
 BG Group for 421 million pounds ($608 million).=20
NO RUSH TO SELL ENRON ASSETS=20
Cardone said Dynegy would not rush to dispose of Enron assets in Europe, whi=
ch include some power generation.=20
"Our back is not up against the wall to do a fire sale. We will look at each=
 (Enron) asset individually," he said.=20
Enron has interests in around 4,500 megawatts of electricity generating capa=
city in Italy, Spain, Poland, Turkey and the UK.=20
On a trading level, Cardone said the takeover of Enron would lead to consoli=
dation but he declined give details.=20
Both companies have set up offices across Europe in recent years as market l=
iberalisation has triggered an increase in energy trading.=20
Including BG's storage operation, Dynegy has a European staff of about 400.=20
Enron, which has piled into European energy trading in recent years and has =
been a major driver of liquidity, has a European staff of around 5,000. The =
company is among the top gas and power traders in the UK and Germany.=20
Cardone said Dynegy would operate with only one online trading platform. Enr=
on does much of its trading via its EnronOnline Internet platform while Dyne=
gy is trying to build liquidity on its own DynegyDirect system.=20
"Our initial thoughts are that EnronOnline is an outstanding platform," said=
 Cardone, adding Dynegy might consider selling or renting out its DynegyDire=
ct. "We will only work with one portal," he said. "EnronOnline was a great c=
oncept, although we are not convinced that we are so far behind it with Dyne=
gyDirect."=20
He said Dynegy would rebrand EnronOnline and all Enron products. "There will=
 be nothing called Enron, all trade marks will be Dynegy."

Help Wanted: Enron Trader Resumes Hit The Streets
By Kristen McNamara and Jennifer Morrow

11/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- "Noah's Ark" should be the name of the company that e=
merges from the planned combination of Enron Corp. (ENE) and Dynegy Inc. (DY=
N), according to energy markets lore these days.=20
After all, the logic goes, there will be two of everyone.
Enron gas and electricity traders aren't so sure of that, as job recruiting =
firms can attest.=20
"In the past 60 days, the number of resumes from Enron personnel has increas=
ed substantially," said William Begley, head of the energy and utilities pra=
ctice at Heidrick & Struggles (HSII), an executive recruiting firm in Housto=
n.=20
Resumes are coming from all units at Enron, but the number of those from tra=
ders has grown significantly during the period, he added. Other recruiting f=
irms said that Enron traders have become more receptive to unsolicitied head=
hunting calls lately.=20
No one knows for sure how jobs will shake out at Enron, as the company goes =
through hard times and faces a merger with Dynegy. Recruiters and Enron empl=
oyees are mixed over how much actual fallout there will be.=20
One thing they agree on, though, is that if Enron traders do leave, they are=
n't guaranteed to find new jobs quickly despite their credentials -- which a=
re regarded as sterling in the energy industry. If energy markets contract a=
s a result of Enron's troubles, the job market for traders could flood.=20
Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap currently valued at $10.12 bil=
lion. The companies confirmed the deal late last week. Shares in both compan=
ies rose in heavy trading Monday as investors weighed the planned deal. Some=
 uncertainty remains around the fate of the merger, partly because of the nu=
merous regulatory hurdles it faces.=20
Enron, still the largest energy trading company in the world, has suffered a=
 massive setback in the past month. Four weeks ago, a $1.2 billion reduction=
 of shareholder equity kicked off a slide in the company's share price, and =
prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.=20
Recruiters started seeing more resumes from Enron before the company's troub=
les came to a head. As early as this summer when former Enron executive Jeff=
rey Skilling left the company, employees at the company's non-core units hav=
e been looking for jobs, recruiters said.=20
Electricity and natural gas traders at Enron have long been considered some =
of the smartest participants in U.S. energy markets. The company is a market=
 maker in both gas and electricity, meaning that its prices for both commodi=
ties are benchmarks for traders throughout the markets.=20
Enron led the effort to deregulate U.S. power markets, and has been one of t=
he most vocal lobbyists for deregulation at the state and federal levels ove=
r the years.=20
"Because Enron is such a large counterparty in the energy trading sector, al=
l of its trading partners, everyone, is hoping the thing gets resolved," sai=
d Bruce Peterson, managing director at Korn/Ferry Intl (KFY) in Houston, an =
executive search company. "The whole industry is definitely affected by what=
 has happened at Enron. Until it's sorted out, you have a tremendous amount =
of uneasiness. It needs to get resolved."=20
It will be essential for Dynegy to keep some of the core leadership from Enr=
on, analysts say. By retaining the best, Dynegy should be able to secure oth=
er strong Enron employees.=20
"In our view, Enron's energy trading and marketing personnel are arguably th=
e most talented and definitely the most profitable group in the industry," P=
rudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale said in a research note Monday. =
"We believe that Dynegy must focus on retaining these valuable traders and m=
arketers if the new company is to realize its full potential in the wholesal=
e segment."=20
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley, who will be at Dyn=
egy after the merger as an executive vice president, said in a conference ca=
ll on Monday that he believes the new company will retain its traders. "Most=
 traders want to be part of the winning team," he said.=20
Some recruiters believe that although many Enron employees are floating resu=
mes, there won't be much actual fallout. Enron's trading operation employs b=
etween 1,000 and 1,500 people in North America; Dynegy's operation is staffe=
d by 300.=20
"But with a few trimmings here and there you won't see a lot of Enron trader=
s on the street, unless they don't like what they hear from Dynegy," said Ja=
ck Carr managing director of Prime Energy Partnership, a search and recruiti=
ng company based in the UK, with an office in Greenwich, Connecticut.=20
An experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn $125,000=
-$150,000 plus a bonus, according to Carr.=20
Right now, Enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused, according to=
 one trader at another company who wouldn't allow his name to be used.=20
"I think they're very nervous," the trader said. "The Enron people think the=
y're better than the Dynegy people, and the Dynegy people think 'we're buyin=
g them, so we can just pick through their stuff.'"=20

Enron CEO May Get at Least $60.6 Million After Buyout (Update6)
2001-11-13 17:14 (New York)

Enron CEO May Get at Least $60.6 Million After Buyout (Update6)

     (Adds in sixth graph that Lay has proposed taking pay in
``non-cash form,'' probably Dynegy stock, and will use some of it
to set up a fund for former Enron employees.)

     Houston, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay may get $60.6 million or more
in severance if he leaves after Enron's sale to Dynegy Inc.,
according to a regulatory filing.

     Lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $20.2
million, multiplied by the number of full calendar years remaining
on his contract, if he terminates his employment under certain
circumstances, such as the acquisition by Dynegy, Enron said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    ``That's a ridiculous amount of money for a man who's already
made himself probably tens of millions of dollars,'' said Andrew
Whalley, manager of the Legg Mason International Utilities Trust,
which sold a $5 million stake in Enron in April because of concern
about its bookkeeping.

     Dynegy says its buyout of Enron, the biggest energy trader,
is expected to close in 2002's third quarter. Lay's contract runs
through the end of 2005. His contract provides that he also
receives an amount to cover tax penalties if the payment he gets
is deemed to be an ``excess parachute payment'' under tax rules,
the filing said.

     If the Enron buyout were to close this year, or if there were
another form of ``change of control'' at Enron, Lay may receive
$80.8 million, the Enron filing indicates. Lay had gains of $123.4
million from the exercise of options in 2000, in addition to his
regular salary.

                         Financial Crisis

    Lay will propose to Dynegy that he take two-thirds of his
severance pay in ``non-cash form,'' presumably Dynegy stock, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said. Lay plans to use half of the stock to
set up a fund to provide ``need-based assistance'' to former Enron
employees, Palmer said.

     The remaining third would be in cash so Lay could use it to
pay taxes on the severance package, Palmer said.

      Enron agreed on Friday to be acquired by rival Dynegy for at
least $23 billion in stock and assumed debt, ending a financial
crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and disrupt U.S. power
and natural-gas markets.

     Lay, 59 years old, has said he won't be an active manager in
the new company, which will be led by Dynegy Chairman and CEO
Charles Watson. No decision has been made about whether he might
serve on Dynegy's board, the companies said.

     ``They need Ken Lay to close the deal because of his skill
with regulators,'' said Mark Maloney, who helps manage $1.1
billion in the John Hancock Patriot Funds, who attended a
presentation to investors by the two companies in Boston today.
``Lay is close to the Bush administration, and that couldn't
hurt.''  The Patriot Funds don't own shares of Enron or Dynegy.

      Robert Doty, Dynegy's chief financial officer, refused to
discuss severance packages for departing Enron executives at the
Boston meeting. Enron officials declined to elaborate on the
filing on Lay's compensation.

                            Pay Package

     Lay has been chairman since February 1986. His contract was
extended by two years, to the end of 2005, when he resumed the
CEO's job following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling in August.
Skilling didn't get a severance package because he quit, Enron has
said.

     The company more than tripled Lay's pay package last year to
$18.3 million following its best share-price performance in 20
years, according to a proxy filed in March with the SEC. Enron
shares have plunged 90 percent this year. Lay made $5.97 million
in 1999, according to Enron's proxy.

     Lay also received options to buy 782,830 shares over seven
years, most at $47.31 each, the March filing said. Those options
are now worthless because Enron's stock price is below the price
at which they could be exercised.

     Members of Enron's board of directors each made $50,000 last
year, as well as $1,250 for each meeting attended, according to
the proxy statement. The chairman of the compensation committee,
Charles LeMaistre, received an additional $10,000. LeMaistre, a
medical doctor, is president emeritus of the University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

     The other members of the compensation committee were Norman
Blake Jr., chairman and chief executive of Comdisco Inc.; John
Duncan, the former president of Gulf & Western Industries; Robert
Jaedicke, emeritus professor of accounting at Stanford University;
and Frank Savage, former chairman of Alliance Capital
International. Savage also sits on the board of Bloomberg L.P.,
owner of Bloomberg News.

                            Cash Crunch

     Enron has been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor
confidence this year because of questions about partnerships it
started and put under the control of its senior executives.

     ``I suppose it's important for Dynegy to keep (Lay) on
because of loyalty among the staff,'' Legg Mason's Whalley said.
``But after a textbook financial collapse where he obviously had
some knowledge of what was going on, this (severance package) is
pretty poor.''

     After the Enron acquisition, Watson and Dynegy President and
Chief Operating Officer Stephen Bergstrom will retain the top two
positions. The other two members of the office of the chairman,
which plots company strategy, will be Dynegy's Doty, who will
continue as CFO; and Enron's Greg Whalley, as executive vice
president. Greg Whalley is Enron's president and chief operating
officer.

     Shares of Enron rose 74 cents to $9.98. Dynegy rose $2.63 to
$46.94. Both companies are based in Houston.



Dynegy Saved Enron Merger With Last Minute Pact (Update1)
2001-11-13 15:02 (New York)

Dynegy Saved Enron Merger With Last Minute Pact (Update1)

     (Adds Lehman's Izatt previously worked at Moody's.)

     Houston, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Charles Watson got word at about 7:00 a.m.
Thursday that his plan to take over Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, was in danger because Moody's Investors
Service planned to lower Enron's credit rating to junk.

     With barely an hour before Moody's was to announce the
downgrade, Watson enlisted his bankers, including Lehman
Brothers Holding Inc. Chief Executive Richard Fuld, to lobby
the credit rating agency to hold off. One argument: with the
U.S. economy contracting after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, the country didn't need another bankruptcy.

     The lobbying succeeded -- at a price. The executives
persuaded Moody's to lower its rating one level so Enron
remained an investment grade credit in exchange for six
concessions, including one which made it harder for Dynegy
to walk away from the $23 billion acquisition. Twenty-four
hours later, an agreement was reached.

     ``The Moody's decision was critical,'' Watson said in
an interview. ``I don't even want to think about what would
have happened to Enron had it been downgraded to junk.''

     Frances Laserson, Moody's vice president of corporate
communications, declined to comment. ``Our discussions with
clients are highly confidential,'' she said.

                        Critical Role

     Moody's played a critical role in part because Enron
was already having trouble raising money. The company had
had its rating lowered in October and a slowdown in the
economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit. A
downgrade to junk by Moody's, which rates more than $85
trillion in securities, would have created a cash crisis by
forcing Enron to repay early $3.3 billion of bonds and
limiting its ability to sell short-term debt.

     A junk rating would have prompted Dynegy to abandon the
acquisition, said Watson, and cost Lehman, J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. a collective $105
million in fees for advising the two companies.

     In seeking to salvage the rating, the executives argued
a downgrade to junk would lead Enron to file for bankruptcy
protection. They said Moody's would shoulder the blame,
according to people involved in the conversations.

     On Thursday morning, Moody's was willing to take that
risk. Executives at the ratings company, led by Chief
Administration Officer Debra Perry, told Watson and his
bankers at Lehman that it was about to issue a press release
cutting Enron to junk.

     Moody's officials said Enron couldn't keep an
investment grade rating because the company had no access to
the commercial paper market. A probe by the Securities and
Exchange Commission into its accounting practices and a 90
percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence.

                     Calling on Friends

     With little time to respond, Watson and senior Wall
Street bankers swung into action. Watson called his friend
David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of ChevronTexaco
Inc., Dynegy's largest shareholder. O'Reilly didn't have
time at such short notice to push Enron's case, Watson said.

     Next he enlisted John Watson, ChevronTexaco's chief
financial officer, and Darald Callahan, a member of the
boards of Dynegy and ChevronTexaco, to call Moody's.
Lehman's CEO Fuld and chief fixed-income analyst Ted Izatt
also pitched in, as did J.P. Morgan CEO Harrison and Michael
Carpenter, who runs Salomon, a Citigroup Inc. unit.

     Izatt, the No. 1 ranked analyst for investment grade
energy companies according to Institutional Investor
magazine, previously worked as a managing director at
Moody's. J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon were advising Enron.

     Officials at Lehman, J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon
declined to comment through spokespeople.

                            Fees

     Watson said he and other bankers argued a combined
Dynegy and Enron would be a much stronger company given a
$1.5 billion cash injection from ChevronTexaco, which owns
26 percent of Dynegy.

     ``To be honest, I didn't understand why Moody's was
having difficulties making this happen,'' Watson said.

     Later that day, Moody's executives told Dynegy they
were prepared to keep Enron at investment grade as long as
six changes were made to the proposed acquisition, according
to Watson. Most of the changes focused around the ``material
adverse change'' clause, which allowed Dynegy to cancel the
deal under certain conditions.

     One of those changes would have required Dynegy to
eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if
Enron's debt ratings were cut to junk. Watson said he agreed
to the changes.

     ``If things got bad enough at Enron that it had to be
taken to junk, there would probably be a material change in
its business that would allow us to walk away,'' he said.

                        ChevronTexaco

     Watson and Kenneth Lay, Enron's ceo, signed off on the
revised terms on Thursday. ChevronTexaco, however, had yet
to agree.

     O'Reilly first heard of the changes from Lehman bankers
at a dinner on Thursday night celebrating Chevron Corp.'s
$45.8 billion acquisition of Texaco Inc., that was being
held at the Victor Stewart steakhouse in Walnut Creek, San
Francisco, according to people at the dinner.

     Lehman's bankers, including Steve Wolitzer, co-head of
mergers and acquisitions, and two colleagues, Carlos Fierro
and Grant Porter, flew to San Francisco that day to
participate because they had advised Chevron on the deal.
During the flight they received emails on their Blackberry
pagers from colleagues in Houston detailing the concessions
that Moody's had sought.

                         Tuna Steaks

     After discussing the new terms with O'Reilly over tuna
steaks and filet mignon, the group agreed to reconvene at
Chevron's offices in San Ramon, California at 6:45 a.m.
local time Friday morning.

     While the officials were deliberating, Moody's cut its
rating on Enron to ``Baa3,'' one level above junk. John
Diaz, a managing director who follows the company for
Moody's, said at the time that Enron now needs to ``shore up
confidence in the company so that counter-parties continue
to trade with it.'' Moody's maintained its negative outlook.

     Chevron still needed more time to consider the terms.
At 5:50 p.m. New York time O'Reilly called Dynegy's Watson
to tell him Chevron's board had agreed. About 15 minutes
later, Enron and Dynegy announced the purchase.

     ``It's amazing how this deal came together,'' Watson
said.

Lemon Laws Won't Save Dynegy

If you believe Dynegy's (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) account of its planne=
d purchase of energy-trading rival Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , it=
's getting a slightly damaged Mercedes for the price of a Pinto.=20
At face value, it appears to be a fabulous deal. Dynegy is acquiring a weake=
ned-but-repairable competitor on the cheap. So what's not to like?=20
The problem is, Dynegy seems to be taking a rather sunny view of Enron's fut=
ure. Recent earnings restatements and other revelations suggest Enron may ac=
tually be a junker when it comes to profitability, though Enron's disclosure=
 practices make it impossible to know for sure. Then there are indications t=
hat Dynegy doesn't expect to write down the value of Enron assets by large a=
mounts, which, if true, will certainly raise eyebrows, given the poor perfor=
mance of many Enron businesses.=20
If Dynegy proves to have been optimistic in its merger math, investors may s=
tart betting against this deal. Such an outcome would increase suspicions th=
at Dynegy rushed into this merger because an Enron collapse would've cratere=
d its business.=20
Echoing statements from Dynegy executives on a Monday conference call, compa=
ny spokesman Steve Stengel denied his company is doing the merger because it=
 feared being damaged by an Enron collapse. Dynegy actually owes Enron money=
, rather than the other way 'round, he said. "Enron's core business is stron=
g, and that was a key reason Dynegy undertook merger discussions with Enron,=
" Stengel remarks.=20
Both stocks rose sharply Monday, Enron adding 61 cents to $9.24 and Dynegy r=
ising $5.55, or 14%, to $44.31. Still, Enron remains 22% below Dynegy's impl=
ied acquisition price. The stock action suggests the market is deeply divide=
d over the deal. The deep discount on Enron is a sign that the deal won't ge=
t done. Yet Dynegy's leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction=
 and its economics. Until we know more about Enron's numbers, we won't be ab=
le to judge whether Dynegy investors are right to be bullish, however.=20
Strong Indeed
Among the deal's avid supporters were a number of sell-side analysts who are=
 longtime Enron bulls. They particularly liked Dynegy's prediction that the =
combined entity, to be called Dynegy, would post earnings 35% above current =
2002 estimates for stand-alone Dynegy. And these bulls point out that this a=
ccretion number doesn't include any merger synergies and it assumes Enron's =
2002 earnings are $1.50, which is 25% lower than analysts currently expect.=20
Dynegy executives repeatedly stated Monday that they wanted to get rid of En=
ron's noncore operations and keep the trading business, which has contribute=
d the lion's share of Enron earnings, as well as pipeline assets. Clearly, D=
ynegy believes that Enron's core trading business made real profits. How muc=
h of a leap of faith is that? A considerable one. As this column has noted, =
Enron doesn't make it possible to break out profit margins for trading, whic=
h is included in the wholesale line in Enron's income statements.=20
In fact, the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains, many of which =
are probably one-time in nature. Enron's deals with obscure partnerships gav=
e a huge boost to profits, according to earnings restatements made last week=
=2E Don't forget that it's these partnership dealings that are under investi=
gation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Without them, and excludin=
g one-time sales, Enron's traders may actually make very little.=20
Marky Mark
One fear was that Dynegy would have to mark down Enron's underperforming ass=
ets by billions of dollars. Charges erode equity. Lower equity would possibl=
y mean a higher debt-to-capital ratio (calculated by taking debt as a percen=
tage of total capital, or debt plus equity). If this ratio gets above 50% to=
 55%, rating agencies might consider downgrading Dynegy, which could deter c=
ounterparties from trading with it. But Dynegy expects the debt-to-capital r=
atio to be about 40% in the merged institution.=20
Somewhat implausibly, Dynegy's forecasts don't appear to factor in big markd=
owns in Enron equity. In the third quarter of next year, Enron's equity is e=
xpected to be $9.5 billion. That's only slightly below what it probably was =
at the end of this year's third quarter (Enron still hasn't released a third=
-quarter balance sheet). How can it not decrease over the next 12 months?=20
A person familiar with the matter says that Dynegy also expects to mark up E=
nron assets at the time of the deal's closing. These markups are expected to=
 at least partially offset any markdowns, this person adds. But it's tough t=
o identify any Enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustment=
s, while it's easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones. Dynegy =
needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being s=
ubject to the adjustments.=20
Dynegy's Stengel didn't comment on the question of equity writedowns.=20
By stretching too far in its assumptions, Dynegy may be trying to dress up a=
 risky merger as a safe one. But a risky merger may, in Dynegy's view, have =
been preferable to having Enron go down. Again and again Monday, Dynegy exec=
s said they've done their due diligence and they believe that there aren't a=
ny huge skeletons in Enron's closet that could upset the merger.=20
But contrast this stance with that of Standard & Poor's analysts, who said F=
riday that they would've downgraded Enron's debt to junk status if Dynegy ha=
dn't agreed to buy Enron. One of the S&P analysts said Friday that they didn=
't have a full understanding of all the partnerships that Enron has been dea=
ling with. If S&P, which, like other rating agencies, has been locked in dee=
p and detailed discussions with Enron for weeks, doesn't know the effect of =
all the partnerships, how can Dynegy?=20
"Dynegy has been doing business with Enron for 16 years. We know them and th=
ey know us," Stengel replies. "We are comfortable with the due diligence we =
have conducted thus far and will continue to look at Enron and their operati=
ons in the coming weeks and months."=20
Until Dynegy comes up with more details, assume Enron is a Pinto.=20



Dynegy asked FERC to revise regs=20
CBSMarketWatch.com, 11/13/01
Lisa Sanders
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Long before Enron and its Northern Natural Gas Pipeline =
entered the picture, Dynegy complained to the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=
ission about companies with pipeline systems crowding out competitors from t=
he natural gas transmission market.
In a filing dated Jan. 5, 2001, Dynegy (DYN ) asked to speak in front of the=
 FERC about what it characterized as "affiliate abuse and structural prefere=
nces," which are "alive and growing in the gas industry."
Now, even if Dynegy's $9 billion takeover of Enron fails, the power generato=
r can keep the energy trader's Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, according to t=
he merger agreement.
"They're kind of complaining about themselves now," said Raymond Plank, chai=
rman and chief executive of natural gas and oil producer Houston-based Apach=
e Corp. (APA ), in an interview.=20
Northern Natural is Enron's (ENE ) largest transmission system with 17,000 m=
iles of pipeline.
"Our position has not changed," Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said in an e-=
mail to CBS.MarketWatch.com. "We do not believe that companies should be abl=
e to 'abuse' their power within a market and we also believe that regulators=
 need to continue to monitor markets to ensure market abuse does not occur."
In a subsequent e-mail, Stengel said "We are going to comply fully with FERC=
 regulations." The answer was in response to a question about how Dynegy pla=
ns to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system.
In the executive summary Dynegy filed to the FERC, the company claimed that =
structural affiliate preference "is a far greater threat to market participa=
nts in coming years."
Dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate "can alwa=
ys pay more, or withstand greater risk from, services purchased from home pi=
pelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company." Dyne=
gy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines, they crowd ou=
t competitors.
One concern Dynegy listed is the "vertical overlapping" of gas pipeline comp=
anies and utilities. Dynegy owns the electric and gas utility Illinois Power=
=2E
In its comments, Dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relati=
onship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference =
problem. Dynegy also recommended that if "rampant" abuse is found, the compa=
ny should be required to divest the non-regulated affiliate."
On Sept. 26, the FERC issued a statement proposing a set of uniformly applie=
d regulations to oversee the relationship between regulated transmission pro=
viders and their energy affiliates.
Citing the sweeping changes in both the gas and electricity markets, the FER=
C said that current rules "fail to address the sharing of confidential shipp=
er information and transportation information with all energy affiliates."
The FERC proposed that the employees of transmission providers involved in t=
he operation of transmission systems function apart from the providers' sale=
s or marketing employees and energy affiliates.
"In addition, the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission inform=
ation would be broadened to include all energy affiliates," the FERC stated.
Apache's Plank said his company is in the process of figuring out how best t=
o help. Apache wants to take the volatility out of the energy market, and he=
 pegs Dynegy and Enron as major contributors to the situation.=20
"The government says they believe in transparency, but they believe it appli=
es to everyone (else)," he said. "If they let us know what they're looking f=
or, we could be very helpful in the interest of the U.S."
Shares of Dynegy added 89 cents to $45.20 in Tuesday trading, while Enron ad=
vanced by 15 cents to $9.39.

Compaq, Continental Eliminate Jobs, Houston Feels the Pain

Compaq, Continental Eliminate Jobs, Houston Feels the Pain

     Houston, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Houston, you have a problem.
     The fourth-largest U.S. city has been shaken by declines at
three of its biggest employers -- Continental Airlines Inc.,
Compaq Computer Corp. and now Enron Corp., which last week agreed
to a takeover by local rival Dynegy Inc. amid a financial crisis.

     The airline and the computer maker are cutting tens of
thousands of jobs because of a slumping economy and reduced demand
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Analysts said business
growth will slow in Houston, home to President George W. Bush and
Halliburton Co., the oilfield-services company once run by Vice-
President Dick Cheney, and the city's largest employer.

     ``Having a couple of favored sons in the White House doesn't
seem to matter when everything else is going wrong at once,'' said
Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities Inc. ``This
historically has been a boom and bust city and now, for a host of
reasons, the floor is crumbling beneath it.''

     Houston's identity is closely tied to its businesses. The
Houston Astros baseball team plays in Enron Field, the downtown
retractable-roof stadium. Enron paid $100 million to put its name
on the 42,000-seat stadium. The Compaq Center is home to the
Houston Rockets basketball team.

     The city, for decades a symbol of the oil and energy
industries, in the last 10 years has become more representative of
the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, one of
the guardians of that economy, is scheduled to speak at the James
A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Houston's Rice University
today.

     Houston is home to 21 Fortune 500 companies and last year
rose to become the world's 30th largest economy by gross domestic
product from 34th. Houston's GDP rose on average 4.5 percent in
each of the last four years. That growth rate slowed to 1.3
percent through the first nine months of 2001.

                         Cutbacks

     Continental, the fifth-biggest airline in the U.S. and
Houston's second-biggest biggest employer, said in September that
it would cut 12,000 jobs as the attacks in New York City and
Washington kept travelers at home.

     Compaq, Houston's fifth-largest employer, has agreed to be
bought by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. in a transaction that is being
met with skepticism by analysts and investors. If the transaction
does go through, the companies plan to chop 15,000 jobs. Analysts
and investors said last month they expected the total number of
job cuts to approach 30,000 at both companies.

     Dynegy executives say their $23 billion acquisition of Enron
will result in a more-profitable energy trading company. The
combination also will cause job reductions at the companies'
overlapping businesses, analysts said.

     ``The Houston economy will take a hit from the job cuts,''
said Robyn Kapiloff of Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating
company. ``We're taking a wait and see approach.''

     Moody's rates the city's bonds `AA3,' a high investment
grade. Houston's airport bonds are rated `A1.'

                         Optimism

     Houston officials say their city will rebound.

     ``People in Houston take kind of a New York attitude to the
economic problems,'' said Sharon Adams, Houston's deputy
controller. ``They say we've been there before when times were
hard in the 1980s, and we'll come out of it stronger.''

     Last month, Houston was put on the short list of U.S.
finalists to bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with New
York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco.

     ``In the long run, this city has a great quality of life and
the infrastructure to absorb these losses,'' said Barton Smith,
director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the
University of Houston.
