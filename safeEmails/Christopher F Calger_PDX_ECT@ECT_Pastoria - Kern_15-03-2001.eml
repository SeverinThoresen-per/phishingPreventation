Calpine just confirmed the following:  Tomorrow they will commit to 50-100 p=
er day of Kern expansion.  They will commit 100/day if Enron commits to take=
 50 of it if the project sale does not close.  If Enron does not commit to t=
he 50, they will only go in for 50 and Enron will not have any rights to it.=
 =20

Bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100/day of transport to=
 0-50 per day.  We will need to decide on this tomorrow morning.=20
