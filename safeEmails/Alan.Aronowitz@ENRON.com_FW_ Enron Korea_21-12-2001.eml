I spoke with YH Jo of Kim & Chang today. He would be prepared to act for us =
if we are able to pay a fee estimate in advance. I have briefed YH Jo on wha=
t we would require, ie:-

1.	Opinion on terminating 3 employees of ECT Korea and assisting in the actu=
al termination (I forwarded the 3 employment contracts for preliminary revie=
w).
2.	Dealing with the Landlord of EI Korea regarding handover of the premises =
and recovering the security deposit.
3.	Deregistration of ECT Korea and EI Korea (including dealing with the free=
ze on the bank account, if necessary).
4.	Working with accountants (eg. PWC Korea) to sort out assets and liabiliti=
es, if required.

I have also asked for their fee estimate and account details if the advance =
payment is approved.

Alan - I have not copied Michelle cash and Scott Gilchrist on this note. Ple=
ase advise if I should at this stage.

Will keep all advised.

Regards
Matt=20
