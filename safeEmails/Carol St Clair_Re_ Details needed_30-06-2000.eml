There are a number of factors that determine priority, one of them being=20
exposure amounts.  I have asked David to prepare a chart for me before I=20
spend alot of time pursuing counterparties and that is what I am waiting=20
for.  I would really like to have this information within the next week so=20
that before I go on maternity leave I can at least summarize what needs to b=
e=20
done.  Can someone else in credit give David the Exposure information so tha=
t=20
David can finalize the chart with the other information that I have=20
requested?  I am afraid that if we wait until you get back, I will be gone.

I think that we should meet soon to resolve the current need
of obtaining exposures for our outstanding unexecuted confirmations.

Please let me know your availability for next week.=20
I am suggesting Wednesday at 11am.

Thanks
