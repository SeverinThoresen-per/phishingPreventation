Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:

We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to fin=
d ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the cor=
responding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is=
 no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up wi=
th a couple of things to try:

Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other info=
rmation they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifie=
s each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating th=
e data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quant=
ity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that t=
his file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the=
 need to use the Passport file altogether.

I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I hav=
e misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact m=
e with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Chris
