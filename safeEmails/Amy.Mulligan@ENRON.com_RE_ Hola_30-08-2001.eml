Actually, (keep this between you and me, because it is kind of serious), Ted=
's romance led to some
trouble for him as word got back to his fiancee. He seems to be out of the d=
oghouse, now, though,
which is good.=20
The second trip had it's own share of weirdness that I will tell you about a=
nother time (if you haven't=20
heard from someone already).

Off to a meeting...

I am running things up here, I was tempted to have my assistant send you a r=
eply to your memo however I thought that might be too impersonal...

Just kidding, I'm glad I'm not running things because this old pipe is falli=
ng apart...

Also, I don't think you should be dissing JCI just because you've eaten prim=
e rib on yacht with a parakeet collection...  Nothing new is going on here, =
I think we're getting a new team member next week but nobody with a real opi=
nion has anything nice to say about him.  Did you hear how the second trip t=
o Miami went? I just heard about from the old lady who works for NNG.

Fill me in on the gossip, did anything ever happen with the romances that bu=
dded on the trip?  I think it would be pretty difficult to shown back up in =
the office that next Tuesday!

Later...=20

Amy,

How's the pipeline business treating you? I haven't talked to you since the =
Miami
thing and was just touching base. You're probably running the show up there =
by now.

You should head down to 32 and get some of our lovely bid-week complimentary=
 meal:
James Coney Island hot dogs (from a box) with dilute chili, cheese paste & a=
 side of
tater tots.=20

I'm off  to get a real lunch -  let me know what's going on in TW-world.

Jason
