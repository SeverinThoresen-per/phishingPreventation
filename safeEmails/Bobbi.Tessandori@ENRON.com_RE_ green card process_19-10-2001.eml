Louise,

I can't tell you how excited I am to do it.  I also get the great pleasure o=
f saying who I am working on it for along with working for you at work.=20
It is taking a long time, as we bought a travel trailer and have been workin=
g on getting it ready for the deer lease.  I've decided (like that authority=
) when its finally complete that's when we'll have y'all over for dinner and=
 present it to you then.  Tell me who your framer is, as I will have more it=
ems to frame down the road.

P. S. I showed you my son's Christmas stocking it took me a year to complete=
 it and I was traveling a lot and used many flights as stitching time.

Thanks again for being #17!  I am very excited for you.

Best Regards,
Bobbi
