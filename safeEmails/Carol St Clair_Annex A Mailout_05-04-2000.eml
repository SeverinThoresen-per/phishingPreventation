Jeff:
Here is what we are doing today with respect to the revised form of Annex A:

1. Marie sent to Bob Bowen yesterday the new forms of Annex A for ENA and EC=
C=20
and it is my understanding that as of today, these forms will be used for al=
l=20
new Omnibus Counterparties.

2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for=
=20
the month of March and with the exception of the Canadian counterparties, we=
=20
are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the=20
end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are=
=20
waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.

3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus=20
Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the=20
list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out.=
 =20
It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about=20
this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to=20
those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.

4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1.=
 =20
I will update the Special Handlings List to include those counterparties tha=
t=20
have requested special exceptions that we are okay with.

I will be at the Enron legal conference the rest of the week but will be=20
checking voice mail.

Carol  =20
