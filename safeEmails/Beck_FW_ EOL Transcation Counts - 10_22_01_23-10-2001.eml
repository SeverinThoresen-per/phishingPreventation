This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for=
 the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would=
 like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions =
via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can gi=
ve you a complete recap at end of day. =20

Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions f=
rom counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I =
would suggest that you do so. =20
