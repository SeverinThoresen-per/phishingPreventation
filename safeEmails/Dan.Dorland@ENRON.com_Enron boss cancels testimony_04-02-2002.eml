Enron boss cancels testimony=20
Cites 'disturbing' TV talk: Blames 'prosecutorial' tone, claims of security =
fraud
Jason Chow=20
National Post=20
Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay said yesterday he would not testify =
at today's scheduled congressional hearing into the company's collapse, blam=
ing legislators' "prosecutorial" comments on TV talk shows yesterday.
"Not only were there corrupt practices, we are finding what may clearly end =
up being security fraud," Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the Hous=
e Energy and Commerce Committee, told NBC's Meet the Press.
An internal company report released Saturday criticized Mr. Lay, other execu=
tives, board members and auditors for the collapse.
It showed managers took home millions of dollars through complex partnership=
s, while hiding at least US$1-billion in losses.
Other politicians denounced the company's management before TV cameras yeste=
rday in response to the report.
Last night, Mr. Lay cancelled his testimony.
"In the midst of our preparation, particularly disturbing statements have be=
en made by members of Congress, even today, on the eve of Mr. Lay's schedule=
d appearance," his lawyer, Earl Silbert, said in a letter to lawmakers on th=
e Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.
"I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitati=
on."
Sen. Byron Dorgan, chairman of another Senate Commerce subcommittee investig=
ating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, said on Meet the Press the rep=
ort "suggests massive problems" and shows "a culture of corruption."
While Mr. Dorgan said it was up to the U.S. Justice Department to decide whe=
ther to press criminal charges, he added the report showed "clearly some thi=
ngs have happened here that are going to put some people here in real jeopar=
dy."
The 203-page report, written by a team headed by the dean of the University =
of Texas Law School, said Mr. Lay "bears significant responsibility" for "fl=
awed decisions" in approving some transactions that hid debt and offset loss=
es.
The report said these transactions did not follow accounting rules and were =
implemented improperly, resulting in Enron overstating earnings by US$1-bill=
ion during a one-year period starting in September, 2000.
"Ken Lay obviously had to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme -- a gia=
nt shell game," said Republican Sen. Peter Fitzgerald.
Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, began to unravel in Octobe=
r after it said shareholder equity was reduced by around US$1-billion. The c=
ompany said it used stock to pay off the debt of some of the complex partner=
ships it had created to reshuffle assets and hide debt.
With its stock already in a tailspin, the Enron house of cards began to coll=
apse. The October writedown raised questions about how Enron accounted for d=
ebt and losses of similar affiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated ea=
rnings back to 1997, lowering them by US$586-million.
The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. Its shares sank below US$1 from =
more than US$80 a year ago, wiping out over US$60-billion worth of investors=
' stock including the retirement savings of thousands of Enron employees who=
se pension plans were tied to the shares.
Mr. Lay's decision to withdraw will undoubtedly raise more questions of his =
strong political connections to the White House.
Mr. Lay, an old friend of U.S. President George W. Bush, was also a major do=
nor to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, contributing $326,000 in "soft mone=
y" to the Republican Party.
Mr. Bush has been dogged by questions about the six meetings Vice-President =
Dick Cheney or his staff held with Enron executives last year. Mr. Cheney ha=
s refused to release records on those meetings, saying they involved matters=
 of energy policy, prompting an unprecedented lawsuit from the congressional=
 General Accounting Office.
The personal drama of the top level executives involved has created a subplo=
t of its own. Clifford Baxter, a 43-year-old former Enron vice-chairman, com=
mitted suicide about two weeks ago.
And Mr. Lay enlisted his wife Linda last week in a bid to garner public supp=
ort, appearing on a series of teary interviews on NBC's Today Show where she=
 said her husband had "lost everything" even though he received more than US=
$200-million since 1997 from salary, bonuses and sales of Enron stock.
The Enron report released Saturday singled out other top Enron employees who=
 were involved with affiliated partnerships that enriched themselves by "ten=
s of millions of dollars they should have never received."
The report said former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow pocketed at lea=
st US$30-million, and former general manager Michael Kopper took at least US=
$10-million. The two worked together in forming several partnerships that bo=
ught assets off of Enron.
But the existence of these transactions "was merely one aspect of a deeper a=
nd more serious problem," the report said.
"Many of the most significant transactions apparently were designed to accom=
plish favorable financial statement results, not to achieve bona fide econom=
ic objectives or to transfer risk," the report said.
"They allowed Enron to conceal from the market very large losses."
The report also implicated Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, for conspir=
ing with the company. Andersen officials involved with Enron are scheduled t=
o testify today.
Though Mr. Lay has no plans to talk before the committees, politicians have =
said they will rope him into the hearings using whatever means necessary.
"Our committee plans to call him as a witness, and if he refuses, he'll be s=
ubpoenaed just like everyone else," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Mr. Tauz=
in. "They were looking for any excuse to try to wiggle off the hook."
