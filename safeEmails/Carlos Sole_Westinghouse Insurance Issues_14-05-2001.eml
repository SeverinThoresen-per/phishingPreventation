		 Subject: Westinghouse Insurance Issues

I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating to=
=20
the "wet turbine" issue with Westinghouse.  Westinghouse has provided=20
estimates to repair the wet turbine for approximately 5.9 million and to=20
replace it for approximately 3.4 million.  The adjusters for the insurance=20
company have advised in correspondence dated April 25, 2001 that their=20
investigation is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a "prudent=20
uninsured" pending a complete investigation of the claim.  The adjusters hav=
e=20
also stated that Underwriter's liability will be limited to the reasonable=20
costs of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea=
=20
water.  The adjusters have indicated that additional damage, such as rusting=
,=20
resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial=20
damage caused by the sea water.

Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the "wet turbine"=20
(approximately 3.4 million) will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacin=
g=20
the unit until the insurance company completes its investigation.  Enron has=
=20
also asked whether the adjuster's statement that Enron should act as a=20
"prudent uninsured" requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower=20
cost.  It is my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project i=
n=20
which it could place the turbine.  It is also my understanding the Enron doe=
s=20
not know whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should=
=20
Enron delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insuranc=
e=20
company has completed its investigation.

Section 19.2.1 of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse=20
requires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure "Equipment against loss=
=20
or damage arising from customary 'all-risk' marine perils . . ."  Section=20
19.2.1 also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an=20
additional insured.  Although the policy I have reviewed does not=20
specifically name Westinghouse as an additional insured, I am told by Enron=20
representatives that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additiona=
l=20
insured on the policy.

The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this=20
analysis.  The Duty of Assured Clause states:

It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents, in all cases, to take such=20
measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a=20
loss and to ensure that all rights against carriers, bailees or third partie=
s=20
are properly preserved and exercised.

The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part:

No suit or action on this Policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be=20
sustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have full=
y=20
complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy, nor unless=20
commenced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss . . . .

The policy is silent on the specific issue of what happens in the event that=
=20
repair or replacement costs increase over time.  The policy also does not=20
specifically define a "prudent uninsured."  Under New York law, however, the=
=20
measure of the duty that is placed on an uninsured owner in this context is=20
that action which a prudent uninsured owner would take under similar=20
circumstances.  See Intermondale Trading Co. v. North River Ins. Co. of New=20
York, 100 F. Supp. 128, 132 (S.D.N.Y. 1951).  Additionally, the Duty of=20
Assured Clause set forth above sets forth a similar "reasonableness" standar=
d=20
for the conduct of the named Insureds under the policy.  Thus, the "prudent=20
uninsured" advisory given by the adjuster is a real standard which Enron mus=
t=20
consider in making its determination of whether to replace the "wet=20
turbine."  Furthermore, the insurance company's ongoing investigation will=20
not operate permit an inference of waiver of a contractual limitations perio=
d=20
when the insurer advises the insured to act as a prudent uninsured.  See Iss=
a=20
v. Reliance Ins. Co. of New York, 683 F. Supp. 82, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  Thus=
,=20
Enron should pay careful attention to the Time for Suit Clause which require=
s=20
that a suit be brought against the Insurer within one year from the date of=20
loss, in this case sometime in July of 2001.

In light of the policy provisions and the "prudent uninsured" standard, the=20
question becomes whether it is "prudent" for Enron to replace the turbine=20
unit now for 3.4 million or wait until such time as Enron has a use for the=20
unit or until the Insurer agrees to provide full coverage.  It is possible=20
that the adjuster will agree with Westinghouse that the unit was a total los=
s=20
on the date the initial damage occurred.  However, in view of the adjuster's=
=20
April correspondence, it is a possibility that the Insurer will maintain tha=
t=20
subsequent damage, such as rusting, occurred as a result of Enron and=20
Westinghouse's failure to protect the unit after the initial sea water=20
damage.  In that case, the coverage could be less than the full replacement=20
value.

Enron's decision to pay for a replacement unit now also requires=20
consideration of the disputes between Enron and Westinghouse regarding=20
delivery and risk of loss.  Based on our previous analysis of the delivery=20
issues, Enron has a plausible legal position that Westinghouse should bear=20
the cost to replace or repair the damaged unit.  As an additional insured=20
under the policy and in light of its own legal position, Westinghouse must=20
also conduct itself in a reasonable manner.  Why is it any more prudent for=20
Enron to pay to replace the unit now and fight with the insurance company fo=
r=20
full coverage then it is for Westinghouse to do the same thing?  If either=20
party absorbed the cost of the replacement unit now, that party would look=20
first to the Insurer for full coverage and failing that would seek to recove=
r=20
the uninsured portion of the replacement from the other party.  This will no=
t=20
change whether the cost to replace the unit goes up or down.  Further,=20
Westinghouse has control of whether the repair and replacement costs go up o=
r=20
down.  If Enron chooses not to pay to replace the unit now and the cost goes=
=20
up, Westinghouse would be opening itself up to a larger claim in the event=20
that the Insurer did not cover the full replacement cost.

Finally, it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase=20
the replacement unit now under the "prudent uninsured" standard.  First,=20
Enron has a good faith position that Westinghouse is obligated to replace th=
e=20
unit because risk of loss had not passed to Enron at the time the unit was=20
damaged.  Second, it is our understanding from discussions with Enron=20
representatives that Enron has no reason to believe that the replacement cos=
t=20
will in fact go up over time.  Thus, Enron has no reason to believe that=20
purchasing the replacement unit now will minimize the loss as required by th=
e=20
Duty of Assured Clause.  Third, Enron does not currently have a project in=20
which it can place the unit.  When and if Enron did have a project for the=20
unit, it would seem prudent to go ahead and purchase the replacement at that=
=20
time.

Based on the above analysis, Enron can make a compelling argument that it ha=
s=20
acted prudently and in accordance with the Purchase Contract and the Policy.=
 =20
Enron should note, however, that the "prudent uninsured" standard will=20
ultimately be determined by the trier of fact.  Thus, it is ultimately a=20
business decision for Enron whether to go ahead and replace the unit now. =20
Additionally, Enron may wish to consider filing a declaratory judgment actio=
n=20
or other claim against Westinghouse, the Insurer or both to determine who=20
will bear the ultimate responsibility with respect to repair and replacement=
=20
of the damaged unit.

I trust this e-mail is responsive to your request.  If you would like a more=
=20
detailed analysis in memo form please let me know.
