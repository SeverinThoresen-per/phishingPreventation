West Power is starting to prepare for marketing/contracting for Netco - basi=
cally coming up with the following:

Target lists:
- National dealer - Duke, Williams, etc.
- Strong regional - Pacificorp, BPA, etc.
- Customer - City of Santa Clara

Contract Debate:
- Wish list of modifications by customer
- Copy existing agreements or come up with clean new template?

Customer Message:
- What do we tell them now?
- What do we tell them when we are up and running?


Questions: Do you want me to start looking after the East?  If so, should I =
call Duran?  Presto? If I am in Houston next week I can meet with the team.

Thought: The most important counterparties are the big dealer/marketers that=
 will want to have a physical gas, physical power and ISDA agreement.  Do we=
 want me to help coordinate any of this across other groups?  Sager and I ar=
e thinking through this on power - I'm not sure where gas is.

Regards,
