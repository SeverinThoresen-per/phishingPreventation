Subject:	Cooper Richey EXPAT taxes

Hi all.   Cooper came to see me with a concern about the amount being deduct=
ed from his U.S. payroll for EXPAT Foreign taxes.

When I took a look at what Cooper has paid year-to-date, he's already paid U=
S$33,337.44 in foreign tax of the total $47,187.18 for the year.

Please reduce his per pay deduction for Canadian tax to US$865.60 for the re=
maining 16 pay periods in 2001.  At year-end he should have paid the $47,187=
=2E18.

Kindly give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
