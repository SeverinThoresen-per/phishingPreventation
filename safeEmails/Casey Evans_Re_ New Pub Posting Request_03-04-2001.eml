Donnie is looking at this.  As long as Willie is pulling in the requested=20

I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday=20
afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to sen=
d=20
out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request,=20
but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of=20
commmand?

Thanks,
Kate

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do=20
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt=20
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01=
=20
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours=
,=20
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak,=20
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing=
=20
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possibl=
e=20
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you=20
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
