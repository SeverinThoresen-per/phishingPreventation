Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received autho=
rization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (J=
ohn Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to =
get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he d=
oes) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Frank
