Don:
In case you haven't arrived by the time I leave I wanted to fill you in on t=
onight's activities. =20
JD explained the MHEB relationship and how we should move there power.  As a=
 result I moved 100MW from MHEB to AECI HE 7 & 8 (tag DPL8643).
Be sure to notice the huge profit I raked in on the deal. =20
100 MW was all they could give me (they originally told us 200 but at HE 2 t=
hey called to cut that down to only 100)
I put the deal in the services p&l under MHEB but I didn't empower the deal =
because I didn't know which book to put it in.=20
I will be in tonight in case we need to go over this in detail.
Thanks,
Andrew=20
