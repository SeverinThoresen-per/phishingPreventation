As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organizat=
ion has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally =
set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details=
 such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power tra=
ders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!! =20

Thanks!
