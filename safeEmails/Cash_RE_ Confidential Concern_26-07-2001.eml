Michelle -

Since this is in Venezuela and thus part of wholesale, I am sending you a co=
py of this letter for you to review.  I'm not sure who should take the lead =
between you and Sharon but I'll leave that to you guys to work out.  Please =
let me know who is taking the lead on this.  Thanks.

I'm not sure I understand what has happened to this guy, but it's something =
that should be handled post haste.  Thanks, SRS
