	Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and=
 substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrit=
e the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan =
Scott City measurement agreement.  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR f=
ormula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Mea=
surement Agreement.  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer wil=
l use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer, who is Steve Winston's bos=
s.  Since Winston's proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a =
draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having Dave de=
liver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevatin=
g the issue to your and John Gibson's level.  However, if Gibson calls you a=
nd raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our mess=
age. =20

	Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imba=
lance based on our metered numbers.  If not, Britt has prepared a demand let=
ter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  I=
 believe that Gibson indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to ta=
lk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send =
the demand letter. I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately=
=2E=20
 	=09
	On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week (relatin=
g to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant run=
ning again), we have made some minor modifications and are sending the count=
erproposal back to OneOk.  We expect to get that deal in place with them soo=
n.  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, a=
nd should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of th=
eir measurment proposal.  =20

	Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. DF

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City meas=
urement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of=
 measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation =
between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That str=
ucture is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agre=
ement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers fr=
om Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the=
 very narrow circumstance of a "BTU measurement error" (i.e., when the chrom=
atograph malfunctions).  =20

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEO=
K's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters =
and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform=
 to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes=
 and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration.=20

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine w=
hether to call a "special test" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic met=
ers pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon c=
alling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the=
 ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of th=
e meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any tim=
e if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to tr=
ack the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurem=
ent and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications =
and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specificat=
ions.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, =
based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plan=
t, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective =
of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a spe=
cial test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the mete=
red data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to =
that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.=
