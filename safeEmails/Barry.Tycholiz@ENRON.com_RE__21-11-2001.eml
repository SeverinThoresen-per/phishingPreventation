As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to i=
nform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they c=
annot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy w=
ill no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately=
 predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good lu=
ck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they woul=
d want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both =
are seeing this type of thing first hand. =20

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said=
 it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be =
better off if we found someone new."=20


Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.
