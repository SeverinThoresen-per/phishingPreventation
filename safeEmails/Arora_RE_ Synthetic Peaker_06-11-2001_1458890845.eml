Just got off the phone with the customer.  Seems we were sufficiently off th=
e market that they didn't see any upside in stringing us along.  I told them=
 that the indicative price came from our structuring group and that we would=
 now try to tighten things up directly with the desk.  Ergo, we get another =
shot.  Let's make it a good one.

Apparently, we are not as competitive as we need to be here.  Let me know if=
 there's anything we can do here to make this more attractive.  My quote to =

Greg:

We have completed our evaluation of the two proposed structures (1) May

through September and (2) June through August for a three year duration

beginning in 2003.  Unfortunately, based on the prices quoted below, neither

evaluates well enough that we would want to pursue any further.  We

appreciate your interest and remain interested in any future proposals you

may want to offer.

Regards,

Wayne Hilson
