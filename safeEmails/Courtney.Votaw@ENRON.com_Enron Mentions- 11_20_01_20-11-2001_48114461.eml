Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of=
 some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quart=
er earnings.=20
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit t=
o earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investm=
ent partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book va=
lue of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held b=
y the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the com=
pany said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to =
honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand o=
bligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-m=
inus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note.=20
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or =
they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One =
of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that=
 Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intend=
ed to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying t=
o negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to pr=
eserve its cash.=20
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment=
 risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake o=
f a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and =
disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings dow=
nward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balan=
ce sheet.=20
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its la=
test SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court i=
n Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that En=
ron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by a=
greeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate i=
nvestigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vig=
orously defend itself.=20
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers =
for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the comp=
any reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 m=
illion last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Se=
pt. 30 was widened to $664 million.=20
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily f=
inal because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its rev=
iew, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accou=
nting practices.

By ANDREW BALLS, ANDREW HILL and GARY SILVERMAN.

Financial Times

Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from it=
s proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a =
move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and =
financial markets.=20
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worrie=
s that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely d=
ifficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were und=
er the impression that the "material adverse change" clause could be trigger=
ed.
"There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, o=
r even likely to happen," one banker said. "And the knock on effects of it n=
ot going ahead are not good," he added. None of the bankers would agree to b=
e publicly identified.=20
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior=
 bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met w=
ith officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago.=20
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to=
 give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness.=20
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the =
main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid.=20
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last=
 week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market=
 capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure=
=2E=20
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had=
 been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the =
merger agreement were not too loose.=20
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outco=
me of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, po=
ssible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and ear=
nings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.=20

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter=20
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the co=
mpany made more adjustments to its earnings Monday.=20
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-=
quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first n=
ine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting error=
s.=20
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay=
 off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarant=
ee the debt.=20
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which c=
ompanies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance =
sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing mad=
e Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, becaus=
e of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the ne=
ed for more time.=20
"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making pro=
gress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron=
's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas Schoo=
l of Law.=20
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy =
natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires E=
nron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency S=
tandard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collat=
eral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the =
deal can sell off the partnership's assets.=20
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up =
with an acceptable agreement on the debt.=20
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investmen=
t grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the=
 company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in rece=
nt years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water=
 Trust.=20
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusio=
n from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of inve=
stment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by =
other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat.=20
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses=
 in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investmen=
t partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approv=
al of the company's board of directors.=20
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a=
 way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines =
of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without addin=
g too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock.=20
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the ent=
ities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigati=
on that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nea=
rly $600 million.=20
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which=
 led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The c=
ompany eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost=
 $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $=
2 billion in preferred stock.=20
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers=
, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least on=
e shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called fo=
r an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Ho=
uston-based Waste Management.=20
"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accountin=
g and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable n=
umbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Ov=
ersight Board requesting the investigation.=20
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold=
 in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of=
 Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to dra=
w investors' attention to the company's unusual finances.=20
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrativ=
e consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor.=20
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it =
filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest ci=
vil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or de=
ny the charges.=20

WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police =
itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special=
 investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Was=
te Management Inc.=20
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released=
 Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Ander=
sen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival D=
ynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 mi=
llion euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997.=
=20
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatme=
nt of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Off=
icer Andrew Fastow.=20
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In=
 June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it nei=
ther admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Manageme=
nt.=20
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-acti=
on lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management=
's reported earnings in the mid-1990s.=20
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is =
undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that =
review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by o=
utside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of director=
s.=20
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, a=
nd Andersen's track record, "there appears to be little reason for the publi=
c to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process," Mr. Dingell wrote.

Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages.=20
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million=
 severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned a=
cquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would =
keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined c=
ompany. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by in=
fluential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits.=20
"In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers an=
d managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line=
 with their performance," says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice lead=
er of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York.=20
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associat=
es, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance re=
presents "the continuing trend of executives being clueless."=20
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from ex=
ercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Tho=
mson Financial.)=20
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rak=
esh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to=
 stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to g=
ain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered =
by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At U=
S Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the com=
pany.=20
Firm Relationship=20
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unus=
ual formal mentoring program for first-year associates.=20
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a d=
esignated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such=
 as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will=
 be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year.=20
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked =
by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by A=
merican Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive th=
ey are being treated, ranked the firm last. "It wasn't an accurate reflectio=
n of the firm," he says. "But it was a wake-up call."=20
So, CWT created an "associate task force" that identified key issues and exp=
lored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was on=
e result.=20
Hiring Blitz=20
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way.=20
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently a=
nnounced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. I=
t has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home.=20
"We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have g=
reat realtors," says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and c=
ulture.=20
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 ma=
rkets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The compan=
y has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market =
its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects.=20
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company =
will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to mak=
e connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission b=

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments=
 over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if =
any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going con=
cern would be called into question.=20
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, t=
he company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tue=
sday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but fac=
es debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next=
 year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, say=
s the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit=
 rating is downgraded any further.=20
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been =
able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third =
quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books re=
lated to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 mi=
llion in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate=
 statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no long=
er be relied upon.=20
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat =
on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into=
 Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen co=
uld not be reached last night.=20
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dyne=
gy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies =
have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further =
downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. An=
y downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading busines=
s, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business=
 with Enron entirely.=20
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures=
 yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligation=
s before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron sai=
d it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September.=20
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financi=
ng through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition=
, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million i=
n assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets=
 next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronT=
exaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year=
=2E=20
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading op=
erations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the hug=
e obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probabl=
y have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities=
=2E=20
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new d=
isclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investor=
s and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before t=
he merger with Dynegy was announced.=20
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' M=
s. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more =
inherent than perceived.''=20
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy sh=
are for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron'=
s share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the=
 deal will be completed at the announced terms.=20
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was re=
leased, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At t=
hose prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's sha=
re price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announce=
d.=20
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowere=
d could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce=
 the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that=
 the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the=
 implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share.=20
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the=
 share price slipped to $9.=20
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous year=
s by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional det=
ails on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts =
Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could c=
ome as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the=
 partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fal=
len, one write-down could be $700 million.=20
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures tha=
t in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking=
 losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its bal=
ance sheet.=20
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for =
some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it=
 needed to pay off the debts.=20
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset=
 sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with r=
espect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact o=
n Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination=
 of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller C=
onoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital.=20
"Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it," =
said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Metho=
dist University in Dallas.
"All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employ=
ee growth base," he said. "It is easier to conduct the business in the Houst=
on market because not only are all the major companies there, all the suppor=
t is in Houston as well."=20
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's t=
hird largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though th=
e nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Franc=
isco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each h=
as thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city.=20
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen =
discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources la=
y beneath Texas soil.=20
"Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discover=
ies," said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Housto=
n-based oil consulting firm. "But certainly with high-speed communications d=
eveloped over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized mo=
re in the financial centers.=20
"What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the cal=
iber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-=
companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into toda=
y's oil capital."=20
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and nume=
rous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting=
 and related companies.=20
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms=
 such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they =
operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout th=
e city.=20
"Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all=
 the important pieces of the oil industry in one place," Bill Gilmer, an eco=
nomist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent =
publication. "The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to H=
ollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit.=
"=20
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

11/20/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve =
from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003.=20
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company wou=
ld also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months=
 of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annua=
l rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries =
about the falling oil price.=20
"Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price =
environment you don't want to be in this business," he told reporters after =
addressing analysts in New York.=20
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35=
bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident=
 that the ChevronTexaco deal was right.=20
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of =
global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas pro=
duction. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share a=
fter tax.=20
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the ri=
val energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immedi=
ately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its =
direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a furt=
her $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the d=
eal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.=
5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in eq=
uity.=20
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worr=
ies about potential hidden liabilities at Enron.=20
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron=
, and Mr O'Reilly said there was "a full suite of due diligence" that needed=
 to be done on other issues at Enron.=20
* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following=
 a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, wh=
ich was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago.=20
"Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job," said o=
ne. Another banker said Enron management had been "pretty upfront" about the=
 problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to ai=
r their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.=20

trading. It closed at $9.06 in regular trading. The energy company
that's being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., cut third-quarter

     Loudcloud Inc. (LDCL) rose as high as $3.91 in after-hours
trading. It closed at $3.15 in regular trading: The manager of
corporate Web sites said it expects a fourth-quarter loss of
55 cents to 56 cents a share on sales of $15.5 million to

fourth quarter, the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Semtech Corp. (SMTC) rose as high as $39.50 in after-hours
trading. It closed at $38.70 in regular trading. The maker of
chips for communications equipment and personal computers said
third-quarter profit from operations was 10 cents a share, from

12 cents. The company was expected to report profit of 9 cents,
the average forecast of analysts surveyed by First Call.

     MetLife Inc. (MET): The life insurer, which said it will
raise about $1.25 billion in new debt, may have its credit rating
cut in the future, according to Moody's Investors Service. The
ratings agency changed the outlook on MetLife's debt rating to
negative because of the insurer's appetite for assuming higher
levels of risk. About $2 billion worth of debt was affected.
MetLife fell 9 cents to $27.50.

     Northfield Laboratories Inc. (NFLD): The U.S. Food and Drug

cents to $13.25.

Izod brand clothing said fourth-quarter sales will be 11 percent
to 12 percent less than a year earlier because of the slowing
economy and weak retail market. Profit in the current quarter will
be 12 cents to 15 cents a share, in line with the 13-cent average
estimate of a First Call poll. Phillips-Van Heusen shares rose 1
cent to $11.27.

earnings will be ``modestly'' lower for the rest of this year and
the first half of 2002. SunGard shares rose 86 cents to $29.50.

     UAL Corp. (UAL): The union representing mechanics for the
company's United Airlines has rejected an arbitration effort by a
government board, raising the possibility of a strike. The
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
turned down the National Mediation Board's offer to help resolve a
contract dispute between the Chicago-based carrier and 15,000
mechanics and other employees. UAL rose $2.48 to $16.72.




Enron restates Q3 to deeper loss; toils to restructure $690M payment

HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trade=
r restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the per=
iod by three cents a share to 87 cents.=20
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obliga=
tion that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the=
 obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended.=20
``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the o=
bligation,'' he said.=20
Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a claus=
e in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 =
million obligation to become due beginning next week.''=20
Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate =
of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month =
earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share.=20
Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.=20
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through t=
he first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside busines=
ses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in t=
he company's earnings reports.=20
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, fro=
m $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion.=20
In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2=
000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million mo=
re than previously reported.=20
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger c=
redit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations=
 _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets.=20
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron exp=
lained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the c=
ompany's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a speci=
al committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.=20
In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion i=
n non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and ex=
pects to use the proceeds to repay debt.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warne=
d that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduce=
d its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.=20
The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filin=
g made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up agains=
t a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a cre=
dit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that exp=
ires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the deb=
t owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.=20
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the part=
nership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was count=
ing on selling to raise $250 million in cash.=20
The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it ca=
n ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3=
 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for=
 more cash to stay afloat.=20
Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cent=
s per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 month=
s of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after=
 the quarter's end, Enron said.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for =
the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for=
 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half=
 a billion lower than originally reported.=20
It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pa=
y $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Mar=
lin Water Trust.=20
Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts a=
nd "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to contin=
ue as a going concern," the company wrote.=20
Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark=
 terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.=20
CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respect=
ive senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just =
one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings=
 again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects comme=
rcial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating.=20
In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it re=
ceived with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fe=
ll below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At t=
he close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were=
 at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.=20
All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that =
kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. =
The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two=
 such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow ser=
ved as general partner.=20
Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 bil=
lion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.=20
The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and =
rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on No=
v. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 b=
illion in stock.=20
In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing w=
ere not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because o=
f "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complet=
e their review procedures."=20
Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by =
a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its=
 partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.=20

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit

11/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of=
 some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quart=
er earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit t=
o earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investm=
ent partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book va=
lue of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock =
held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, t=
he company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to =
honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand o=
bligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-m=
inus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note.=20
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or =
they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One =
of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that=
 Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intend=
ed to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying t=
o negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to pr=
eserve its cash.=20
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment=
 risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake o=
f a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and =
disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings dow=
nward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balan=
ce sheet.=20
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But=
 its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state =
court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges =
that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholde=
rs by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an ade=
quate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it wo=
uld vigorously defend itself.=20
Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for=
 revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company=
 reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 mill=
ion last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept.=
 30 was widened to $664 million.=20
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily f=
inal because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its rev=
iew, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accou=
nting practices.=20

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC

11/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third qu=
arter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a shar=
e was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end o=
f the quarter.=20
As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the =
second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billio=
n for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.=20
In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share=
 for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share.=20

Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized it=
s review of the company's financial statements in accordance with establishe=
d professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special=
 committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review pro=
cedures.=20
In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its fa=
iled investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unw=
ind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial =
officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities =
and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a doze=
n shareholder lawsuits.=20
According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation =
may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, w=
hich would require additional or different restatements.=20

Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently pr=
eparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize=
 the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divestin=
g non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of d=
ebt and other obligations.=20
Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the finan=
cial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hu=
rt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corp=
orate Filings Alert.=20
The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30.=20
On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement =
that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merge=
r is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002.=20

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week.)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed to
a takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$690 million note next week.

     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,
bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,
according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.
Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-
quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.

     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worse
shape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst at
Sanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.

     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who
doesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a
problem.''

     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut
Enron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back
Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because
Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by
$700 million, the filing said.

                       Partnership Problems

     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits.

     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote
off $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and
retail-energy sales in the third quarter.

     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by
Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690
million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company
said.

                        Brazilian Liability

     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership
that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen
Denne, an Enron spokeswoman.

     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.
It expects to close on $450 million in additional financing
tomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500
million to $1 billion into the company.

     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from
ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.

     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured
with assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to
close on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern
Natural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the
loans was announced Nov. 1.


                      $3.9 Billion Liability

     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its
debt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would
trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies, Enron said.

     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt
owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin
Water Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the
partnerships, which were run by Enron executives.

     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares
of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is
providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell
54 cents to $82.91.


ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)
2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)

ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last
paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
Dynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of
ChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.

     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the
litigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for
Dynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at
an analyst meeting in New York.

     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27
percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as
part of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's
legal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.
Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the
cost of shareholder suits.

     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest
energy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.
Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.

     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in
Houston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and
results. Other investors have filed similar suits.

     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction
that is risk free,'' he said.

     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have
tumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The
stock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based
in Houston.

     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to
$82.91.

     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note
this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.




Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.
27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.

     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's
senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the
company said in a securities filing.

     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.

    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns
natural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below
investment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies.

     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in
debt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water
Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock
and debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the
Dynegy deal could collapse.

    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares
of Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose
$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.



Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s
water unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to
continue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.

     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the
water company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off
investors in March.

     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that
matures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.

     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the
filing said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash, the filing said.

     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix
may need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix
incurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.

     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer
trades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell
8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.

     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.
The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC
investigation of the company's dealings with affiliated
partnerships.



U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says
2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special
investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and
Waste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.

     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman
Charles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.

      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over
four-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste
Management, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
Deloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.


ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS
=46rom CBS.MarketWatch.com

By Leticia Williams

8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter
earnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.

Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,
also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.

Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.

Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations
by Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,
according to the SEC filing.

If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.

In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for
amounts below their carrying values.

"The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
Enron's obligation, " according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is in talks with lenders to "develop a mutually acceptable"
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million
note.

If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $3.9 billion, the company said.

Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch
above speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,
evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under
review. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation.

A note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which
primarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in
Marlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.

The company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.

Company officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital
markets.
