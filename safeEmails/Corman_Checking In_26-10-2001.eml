Hi Ginger & Chris,

Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you rec=
eived the notarized copies of my INS approval.

When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would =
travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November. =20

After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked. =
 Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd d=
rop an email. =20
I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  Ho=
w long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier=
 sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Ka=
zak court date?

I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slippin=
g such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that woul=
d present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.=20

Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know =
that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very n=
ew to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am=
 realistic about the steps involved.
