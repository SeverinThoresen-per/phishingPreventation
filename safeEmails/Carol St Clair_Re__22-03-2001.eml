Akasha:
I would reword the first sentence as follows:

In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the=20
information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has=20
only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has bee=
n=20
repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity=20
(and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that=20
supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that =
a=20
Credit Event has occurred.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If=
=20
you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton=20
who is familiar with this deal.

Carol, can you check the note below.
Thanks
Akasha


In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the=20
guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under th=
e=20
guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your=
=20
notice of Publicly Available Information..

We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011=20
US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again,=20
we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred.

Regards,
