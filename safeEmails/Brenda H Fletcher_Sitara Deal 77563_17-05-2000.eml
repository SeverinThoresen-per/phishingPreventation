Somehow they broke the program rules - I will have to check that out - deal=20
229101 was supposed to be ENA-IM EAST as a secondary desk to the BUG deal.  =
=20
They were able to save it as BUG as the secondary - which they should not be=
=20
able to do - as this breaks the one deal rule per business unit per contract=
=20
per time perod.=20

I cleaned up the deals for you - it is the only way I could make sure it=20
worked - and removed the evergreen flag off the the BUG deal.=20

There are 3 more deals that have May forward activity - can you follow up on=
=20
these - don't forget to cancel the evergreen on the service deals or they=20
will just keep rolling.

Deal # 77563 is a Transport Capacity ticket for a BUG contract which needs t=
o=20
end 3/31/00.  I have been unable to change the end date to 3/31/00 or change=
=20
the demand to zero beginning 4/1/00.  When I try to release after editing th=
e=20
deal, this message appears. How can I get deal 77563 terminated?
Thanks,
Brenda
