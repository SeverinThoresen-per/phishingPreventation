Bob,
Here are a few comments on this note:
1. Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with=20
Enron.  I haven't caught up with him for details but it had to do with=20
underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important. =20
Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided=20
that they didn't need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no=20
sales. =20

2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or=20
be spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in th=
e=20
Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the=20
deep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and=20
worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of th=
e=20
time.  I don't think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems wer=
e=20
completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.=
 =20
Concepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water=20
accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These=20
sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companie=
s=20
were drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for=20
the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.=
 =20
I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to=20
three times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is=20
probably large with international projects (and that doesn't take into=20
account political risk).=20

I'll look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes=
=20
forward.  Feel free to forward this to all participants. =20

Greg

I am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a=20
background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will=20
circulate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.

Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in=20
the Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info=
=20
on this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not=20
continued to do this, etc.

Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep=20
water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep se=
a=20
drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make=
=20
these kinds of projects viable financially?
