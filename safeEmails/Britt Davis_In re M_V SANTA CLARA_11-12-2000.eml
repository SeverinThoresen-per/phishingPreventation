Andrew,

Dan Rogers and I have spoken with Wayne Perry, who is the Enron contact for=20
the negotiations with Exmar.  He was unaware of this arbitration and believe=
s=20
that his contacts with Exmar are similarly unaware of it.  Perry will be in=20
London Wednesday for a conference with Exmar and wants to bring this=20
arbitration to Exmar's attention, in the hopes that it can be quickly=20
resolved on a business relationship basis.

At your earliest convenience, would you please e-mail (my first choice) or=20
telefax (my second choice) to me an executive summary of this matter=20
(something very succinct, preferably in very easily readable bullet-point=20
format) with (1) facts, (2) status, (3) best points worst/points, and (4)=20
recovery/exposure briefly outlined?  Also, would you please advise me who ou=
r=20
opposing solicitor is, and his or her firm?  Last, if you are aware of the=20
name of the primary Exmar in-house lawyer or business person on this matter.

For this information to have the maximum impact, I need to have it in Perry'=
s=20
hands before he meets with Exmar, and the sooner before, the better.  Perry=20
knows that he is not to hand this information over to Exmar, although if you=
=20
wanted (and have the time) to make a second executive summary specifically=20
for him to give to Exmar, that would be fine as well.  =20

Many thanks for your prompt response.  Again, my hope is to try to get this=20
thing dismissed by year-end.

Britt

		 Subject: In re M/V SANTA CLARA

Andrew,

This will confirm our telephone conference of yesterday.  Again, I will be=20
your new contact at Enron in the above-referenced case.  You advised that=20
Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage clai=
m=20
against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of  approximately $165,000,=20
arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of=20
1991.  You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of=20
deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000.  This matter has=20
reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claim=
s=20
were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date.

You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion=
=20
that the parties just drop their respective claims.  I understand that you=20
feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client.  You=20
further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the=
=20
recent past entered into charters with Exmar.

It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given=20
what you have told me.  My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a=20
business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a=20
"drop hands" settlement.  If you retained the publication in which you read=20
about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately. =20
Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the=20
correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience.

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they=
=20
know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under=20
charter to Exmar.  If one of you can suggest other names I might check,=20
please let me know.  I would like to put this old dog out of its misery=20
before year end if it is humanly possible to do so.

Britt
