Rick,
=20
I'd like to introduce you to our company and set-up a one-hourconference cal=
l and discussion with you and/or someone you trustto evaluate this opportuni=
ty.
iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science Depart=
ment at California Institute of Technology.
iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. Wi=
th iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, energ=
y marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning systems as=
 components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring these compo=
nents for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to those compos=
ite events  based on business rules.
iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  l=
oosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  as=
sembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  ap=
plication and data source, to enable new business processes.=20
For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  Applicati=
on Framework=E4 to  detect and react to interdependent market events. This e=
nables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to releva=
nt dynamic events in  their Market Intelligence information environment.=20
The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness applica=
tions over last several years has established the  need and created the abil=
ity to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta Applications.=20
Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.
Thanks,
H. Enzo Olfati=20

P.S. I have also  e-mailed this to others at Enron to determine the appropri=
ate contacts  to have the discussion  with.
