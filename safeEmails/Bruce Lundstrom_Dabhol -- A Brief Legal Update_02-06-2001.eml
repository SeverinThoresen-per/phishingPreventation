Gentlemen -

A few updates:

We hope to file the petition on Monday in the Bombay High Court seeking a=20
ruling that the MERC does not have jurisdiction over the PPA and the current=
=20
disputes between MSEB and Dabhol Power Company.

The Dabhol lenders have planned 3 days of meetings in Singapore this coming=20
week and we will attend these meetings.  Our lenders seem to be increasingly=
=20
nervous.  They may try to cure the construction contract defaults (over $30=20
million would be required in mid-June).  While we do not relish having the=20
construction contracts fall away, we do not believe that funding is prudent=20
at this point.  MSEB has torn up the PPA and stated that it will not=20
cooperate with Phase II power station testing, the only real remaining=20
function under the power plant construction contract.

A few insolvency/creditors' rights lawyers from Skadden will be here on=20
Wednesday to discuss Dabhol creditor remedies and possible DPC defenses (bot=
h=20
in India and the U.S.).  A lawyer from Susman Godfrey is scheduled to join u=
s=20
at that meeting.

Bruce
