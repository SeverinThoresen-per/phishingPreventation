Good Morning Team,

Tribune Co. reported a net loss of $139 million for 3Q01, citing an advertis=
ing falloff, an expensive restructuring, and costs of news coverage in the w=
ake of the September attacks.  The Chicago-based company, which owns 11 news=
papers, 22 television stations, and more than 50 Web sites, had cut 6% to 7%=
 of its work force because of the advertising slump. The attacks increased s=
pending in the form of extra newspaper editions, extended coverage by its TV=
 and radio stations, and increased capacity by its Web sites.  Revenue from =
publishing -- largely newspapers -- declined 8%  and retail advertising was =
down 7%.  For the first 9 months, the company had a net loss of $15.7 millio=
n, compared with year-earlier earnings of $168 million.  The trend continues=
 as major media companies report their 3Q01 results...
Stay tuned for the market wrap this afternoon.
Ayesha
