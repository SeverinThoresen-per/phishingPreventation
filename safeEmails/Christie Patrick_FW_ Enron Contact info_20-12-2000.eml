flight arrangements.  Also, "FYI", the DoubleTree and other downtown hotels =
=20
were entirely, or mostly, sold out, but my assistant found a good rate at th=
e=20
Warwick [$115] by Herman Park, where everyone will be 'housed' in the same=20
location for one night--I also think this location is a good 'Houston-sell'.

Dinner is scheduled for 7 Thursday evening at Churrasco's , and my group is=20
arranging the "TourEnron"--breaking this group into 2.  [FYI: the Energy Clu=
b=20
from SMU (another Skilling Alma mater) had long ago also schedule a tour tha=
t=20
day, so we'll have 19 from SMU and 18 from Wharton on the same day...but so=20
far, all seems manageable.]

As "Tour times" are set, and business unit interview requests are received=20
from the students, I'll keep you posted. =20
Thanks!

--Christie.
