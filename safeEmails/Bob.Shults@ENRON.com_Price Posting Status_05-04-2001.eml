John,

As a follow up to our conversations this week and the testing that has been =
done, I wanted to outline our view of the current status:

Testing/Performance:  To date Houston Street has not met the minimum technic=
al standards that were outlined in our discussion on Monday.  As we explaine=
d, Houston Street must be able to handle a continuous price update standard =
of 20 - 30 updates per second and a peak price update standard of 100 - 200 =
updates per second.  During our testing yesterday we experienced fatal error=
s on several occasions when sending continuous price updates.  It appears th=
at we are not receiving responses to our updates in a timely manner and ther=
efore are timing out the connection to maintain the operational integrity of=
 our system.  We estimate that each bundle of messages (20 - 40 updates per =
bundle) sent to Houston Street was taking around 3 seconds to process.  Give=
n the test performance to date is not acceptable we do not believe the inter=
faces are ready to go live at this point.

Legal:  Enron has requested that Houston Street incorporate the EnronOnline =
short descriptions as product identifiers on the Houston Street site.  Enron=
 has requested that Houston Street have each customer wishing to transact wi=
th Enron acknowledge that they are transacting under the same terms and cond=
itions as they would transact under on EnronOnline.  Houston Street will war=
rant that no customer will transact with Enron without acknowledging such.  =
Houston Street will determine whether acknowledgement will occur on the web =
site or in the trading agreement or both.  Enron has forwarded its comments =
on the Houston Street Trading Agreement for review by Houston Street.

I will contact you later today to discuss what the next course of action is.=
  Thanks.
