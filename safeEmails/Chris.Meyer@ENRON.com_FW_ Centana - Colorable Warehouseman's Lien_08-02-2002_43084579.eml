I talked to Stuart this p.m. about this and argued to blow this off and focu=
s on the larger transaction.  However, what is not clear from the below is .=
=2E..essentially, Centana will have to asert a claim against the molecules i=
n the ground (for pre and post petition amounts), if we are going to pay on =
those claims. =20

If you haven't heard from Joe on this, please get in touch with him. =20

Joe - this is a reasonable request given that we need to understand why they=
 feel that they are entitled to hold the gas.  We are not trying to be argum=
entative but need to understand (and have them articulate a rationale for) w=
hy they feel that they can do this.  Once we hear where they are coming from=
, I think we will be able to get to where everyone wants to go (i.e. settlem=
ent and sale of the gas).

Chris,  Can you request that Centana provide us with their lawyers info, so =
I can contact him.  It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds u=
nder which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic=
 stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attor=
ney.

Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its clai=
m against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged f=
rom "if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas f=
rom you" to "we are holding the gas till you pay us"  Based on Joe's discuss=
ions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to s=
tored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be:=20

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / =
colorable warehouseman's lien=20
       (post petition amounts are already approved);=20
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st d=
ay order;=20
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;=20
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if a=
vailable.=20

My preference is option (1) as :=20
        -       option (2) is the most unlikely,=20
        -       option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk wh=
ile we continue to accrue storage costs, and

        -       option (4) holds significant transaction risk.=20

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Fundin=
g Request ("BFR").=20

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR=
?=20

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed wit=
h (1) above?=20
