John:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  I will wait to hear back from either yo=
u=20
or John M. before I respond to Reliant on our issues list.  I do agree with=20
you on all of the points that they need to address.  On the Event of Default=
=20
issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and=20
void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?  I was concerned=20
that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some=20
confusion as to what Events of default are covered.  What do you think?
