Hello!

As you know (all too well!), your job does not offer you all of the=20
flexibility that you might like.  In an effort to give you a little more fre=
e=20
time, we will start with the following plan.

What's a late day and who gets them?
Each book calc'er will sign up for a  one late day a month.  A late day is=20
defined as a  one in which you do not come into the office until 3 p.m.  =20

When can I have one?
The late days to sign up for include any day Monday-Friday (excluding bid=20
week thru 2nd workday).  Only one person can be out with a late day each=20
day. =20

Who's my back-up?
When you enjoy your late day, your back-up as defined below is responsible=20
for your activities until 3 p.m.  If the following back-up schedule needs to=
=20
change, let's make that quickly.  If you need additional security access to=20
back-up someone, then put that request in immediately.  Each of the back-ups=
=20
should "swap" jobs for a few days (until 3 p.m. to practice your=20
responsibilities). =20

If the back-up plan is successful, then we can potentially expand our=20
creative work schedule possibilities.  We must prove that it will work,=20
however, before can take any more steps.

When do we start?
All regions will implement in June. . .Irena will coordinate the calendar=20
next week.

Let me know what you think!
Carrie
