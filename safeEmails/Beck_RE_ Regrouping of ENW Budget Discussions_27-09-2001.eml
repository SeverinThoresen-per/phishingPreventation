Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in eac=
h.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this w=
eek is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people =
availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The schedu=
le that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate two hou=
rs for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had not bee=
n communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that sc=
hedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have a major=
 conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that Ken La=
y asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the eve=
ning hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious h=
oliday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on Friday after=
noon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.  In orde=
r to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the ti=
me swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00. =
 I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for Ken =
Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for bo=
th of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=20

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES =
budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine the=
 appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of=
 the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have done t=
his without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That is a =
separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and =
our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggested spli=
t on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the decision on=
 cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair f=
or EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, b=
oth for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of t=
ime (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 toda=
y to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for=
 both of us. =20

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that u=
ntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the c=
omponents of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of costs =
and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussion.  =
A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been r=
eached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for discuss=
ion on that.    --Sally=20

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separ=
ation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.  =
 Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations=
?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just hav=
e the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling di=
scussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most se=
nse.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan=
 meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holi=
day, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to =
make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of da=
te, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and atten=
dees as follows:=20
