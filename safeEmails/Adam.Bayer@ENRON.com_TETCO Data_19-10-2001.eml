HI Jon,

The IT guys do not know when we can begin scraping Tetco and Algonquin/Mar d=
ata today, but the moment it comes out I'll get the map down to you.  I don'=
t quite understand the problem, but when we switched to a new server we lost=
 some access rights that we originally had to dukes website.

I'll keep you updated.
