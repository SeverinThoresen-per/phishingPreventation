Subject:	RE: DASH re Cuiaba GSA with YPF/Andina

Is every contract entered into at ETS done with a DASH?  At TGS we enter int=
o numerous transport contracts and they are not covered by a DASH?  In Centr=
al America we market our power out of the various plants and these contracts=
 are not subject to a DASH.  Similar circumstances can be described at Promi=
gas, Ventane, Calife, SK/Enron, Elektro and the Gas LDCs.  If what you descr=
ibe is accurate, then we are not even close to compliance and the G&A invest=
ment necessary to comply will be huge.

Jim- J Block was just a gas contract. At Enron, risk is controlled through o=
ne of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily report=
ing of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken =
on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contr=
act contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doe=
sn't fit into a book. Rick

Help me understand why a DASH is being done for a gas contract?  The DASH pr=
ocess exists to approve uses of capital, not entering into a gas contract?  =
Am I missing something?
