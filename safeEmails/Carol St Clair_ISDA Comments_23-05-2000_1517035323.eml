Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can=20
respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our=20
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I=
=20
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5=20
(b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from=20
the ESP rep below it.

3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different=20
from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has=20
fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with=
=20
respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any=20
payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the=20
exercise of setoff rights.

4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal=
=20
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration appl=
y.

5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.

6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). =20
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.=20
