The Estate version of the systems were commissioned successfuly onto Estate =
hardware this weekend with the users completing their testing on sunday, and=

eek.

Just a few weeks ago there was a lot of doubts that it could be done, but th=
anks to a great display of team work, and just plain hard work, with many la=
te nights (and a few sleep overs....), we met our first major milestone!!!!!

Thanks for the outstanding efforts over the last two weeks, that made this w=
eekend possible. =20
