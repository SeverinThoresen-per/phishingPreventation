	John and Terry, can you work with the teams to get Shelley's name off of th=
e daily
	update list.  She is trying to minimize emails she gets on her blackberry. =
=20

	If you can think of any other lists, let me know. (What about the Bushton i=
nfo, is she=20
	on that list?)

	Thanks for the help.  Lynn
