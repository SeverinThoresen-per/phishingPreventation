Trina:
Could you please make sure that Susan Bailey, a legal assistant in our group=
,=20
gets copies of all of the Raptor docs so that we can keep a file in our=20
group.  Ideally, we should get originals of all of the swap docs but I don't=
=20
know if that's possible.  I just want to make sure that I don't have to go=20
through Scott to get anthing if you know what I mean.    Susan's extension i=
s=20
34737.  Could you also e-mail the latest closing list so that she can keep=20
track of what was signed?  Thanks.

Carol

P.S.  Spoke with Kristina last night and she said that she had a great time=20
in Arizona.  Hopefully I can make the next trip.  Also, when you are in the=20
neighborhood, stop by my office.  I have a great picture of our son that I=20
would like to share with you from the last ultrasound!
