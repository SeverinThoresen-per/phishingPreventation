We have the correct gas quality standards in place today and they are well=20
documented.  They should be an exhibit to every physical commodity contract=20
HPL generates (sales, purchase, transport, storage) - Barbara, please confir=
m=20
this is happening.

The Exxon processing contract has certain tiers of value established.  At=20
greater than 4.0 GPM, we receive 92% percent of the liquids.  Between 3.5 an=
d=20
4.0 GPM, we receive 90%.  And so on.  The 100% shrinkage obligation remains=20
the same.  Therefore as lean gas is added that drives down the total GPM=20
stream below the thresholds, we lose percentages of liquid value back to us.=
 =20
Even when these thresholds are not crossed, there is incremental costs (fuel=
,=20
transportation fees, lean gas absorbs light end liquids from rich gas stream=
,=20
etc), yet no financial benefit.  Therefore our net benefit decreases.

We potentially saw the first benefits of this discussion yesterday.  The dea=
l=20
that caught my attention initially was the IFHSC minus $.13 that is on my=20
desk for execution and the gas is already flowing.  After we have improved=20
the process, Jack Simunek worked with Jeff Austin on a similar type of=20
package yesterday.  The hurdle price was determined to be IFHSC minus $.55. =

Jeff quoted this to his producer, and really got no negative feedback.  I=20
think this potentially confirms what I stated in my original memo.  The=20
reason these producers are coming to us with their lean stream trying to get=
=20
into a rich, processable stream is that other competing pipelines have=20
already significantly lowered their pricing or have flat told them they woul=
d=20
not take the gas due to the impact on processing margins.

Steve,

Lets discuss.  I don't understand why the value of the gas stream to King=20
Ranch was reduced?

Also, are the correct gas standards set forth somewhere and well defined?

In response to your AMTEL message on the PRC, I am getting the PRC results=20
today and will be arranging a few hours/day to meet with everyone to go over=
=20
the results.


Brian
