Louise:

Some guidance on how you want to handle the ongoing HPL costs/reserve manage=
ment for next year.  Specifically, there will be a number of items that roll=
 into next year that will have to be managed. I am going with the assumption=
 that Jim will report into Wes and will be responsible for supporting this e=
ffort. =20

Question:  Do you want me to assume: (i) that I have a seperate cost center =
for HPL and that has Jim's cost allocated to it, or (ii) should this whole e=
ffort just role up to Wes and then I can support it on an as needed basis?=20

I'm open to either, but my recommendation is to keep some commercial oversig=
ht over the settlement of the outstanding HPL issues.  Because, if things st=
art coming unglued, I'm sure I will get dragged back into it anyway.

Regards,
Brian
