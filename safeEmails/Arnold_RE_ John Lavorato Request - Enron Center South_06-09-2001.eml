I understand your concern.  However I don't want to separate origination and=
 trading.  Most of our originators work the daily market and need to be clos=
e to the traders.

Attached is the most recent version of the ECS 6th floor layout.  Each team =
has been assigned a predetermined number of desks.  John has asked that you =
place your people only in the desks allotted to you.  Assistants should be c=
olored in white where applicable.  Some teams are still in the same area and=
 changes may not be necessary. =20

If all of your commercial organization does not fit, please send me back a l=
ist of those people who will need to be assigned a desk on the fifth floor.=20

John would like to have a final revision of this by end of day tomorrow (Thu=
rsday).=20

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention,=20
