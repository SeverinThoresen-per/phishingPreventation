Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to min=
imize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today with=
out this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for "auto-balancing".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could "Trade"

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR &=
 daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.
