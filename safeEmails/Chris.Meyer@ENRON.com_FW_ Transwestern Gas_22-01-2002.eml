Marie -I am working the back end of a deal on Transwestern that Allegheny
may have an interest.

As part of a compression service deal on Transwestern, Enron Compressions
Service (a non-bankrupt Enron entity) is long approximately 12,000 /d of
physical gas at the West Texas Pool beginning Feb 02.  ECS receives these
molecules directly from TW. In turn, ECS converts the gas to cash in order
to pay a portion of the electric bill required to run the electric driven
compression.  With the bankruptcy of ENA, ECS is  looking for another
counter party to monazite the gas.  The contract has a small swing component
which is fixed (each month) during bid week.  The specifics are as follows:

	Contract #1:	Base 7,892 mmbtu/d through December 31, 2006
			   Swing (up only) of 1,120 mmbtu/d through December
31, 2006

	Contract #2	Base 3,462 mmbtu/d through May 31, 2010
			Swing (up only) of 595 mmbtu/d through July 31, 2010

Again TW delivers all molecules to the West Texas Pool.  We are willing to
consider a term of any length, but strongly prefer to sell the term.
