Subject:	Loss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers:

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area (WACM) has just implemented =
a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a re=
minder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be completed.

1.  Please ensure that "WACM" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is important=
 as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses delive=
red.
2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words "WACM Losses".  If the tag=
s are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate th=
e date; i.e., "WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY".
3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy to=
 WACM.
4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplishe=
d same day, next week, same profile.
5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a =
single tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount o=
f loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on prescheduled=
 transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due from=
 day -7.

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new scheduling=
 software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction loss =
energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effect =
that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to you=
 immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send an=
 e-mail.
