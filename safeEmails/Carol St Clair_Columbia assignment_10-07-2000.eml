Tanya:
When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master=20
between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or=20
come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a=20
letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master t=
o=20
The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was=20
not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in=20
fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?
Carol
