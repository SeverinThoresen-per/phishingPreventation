As I have in previous years, I look forward to joining you, your colleagues
and mine at the reception and dinner.

Subject to understandable space constraints, may I be so bold as to suggest
you consider inviting my Center for Energy Finance Assistant Director
Angela Dorsey, who has been closely involved with all UT energy finance
activities?

I take this opportunity to congratulate you on what I believe is, at least
to me, your new title.

Best Regards,
Ehud Ronn
