Several discussions have been circulating regarding current Enron phone numb=
ers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per =
Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418). =20
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but =
would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prio=
r to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-37=
01) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   =09

   Our current "853" numbers will probably be replaced by new "584" numbers(=
Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigne=
d to us.

   Our Current "800" numbers for 24-Hour, "Fax, and Scheduling can be forwar=
ded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turr=
ets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,
