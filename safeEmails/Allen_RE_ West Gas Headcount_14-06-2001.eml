Faith,

Two changes need to be made to the list.  First, Jason Wolfe is a trading tr=
ack analyst on the west desk.  Second,  Matt Lenhart should be an Associate =
as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and R=
andy G.  I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I nee=
d to bring this up during PRC.  Please let me know.

Phillip
