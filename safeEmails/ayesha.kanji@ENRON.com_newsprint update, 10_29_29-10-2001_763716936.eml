 extra Sunday this year, Newspaper Group revenues were down approximately 16=
% . The Newspaper Group's revenue loss specifically related to the attacks w=
as about $2 million.  At The Dallas Morning News, total full-run advertising=
 linage, including preprints and supplements, was down 10.9% versus 2000.  C=
lassified volumes were down 12.8%  with continued weakness in classified emp=
loyment.   At The Providence Journal, total full-run advertising linage, inc=
luding preprints and supplements, decreased 8.3 %.   Retail and classified v=
olumes decreased 9.5% and 7.3 %, respectively.   The decrease in ad linage h=
