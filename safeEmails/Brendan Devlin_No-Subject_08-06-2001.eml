Dominik,

It was good to speak with you at the EEMF Forum; we all found your=20
presentation impressive and the responses to the questions finely tuned to=20
leave us thinking that we had been given priviledged access to information=20
when in fact we hadn't; what a pro!

As I said, my colleague Rick Shapiro (head of our global public affairs)  wa=
s=20
impressed and he was serious when he thought of you for our Frankfurt=20
office.  I am sure that if you showed interest, things could move quickly (o=
r=20
even slowly, if that's what you wanted) and any particular circumstances tha=
t=20
you had would be taken into account.  I can certainly attest to the welcomin=
g=20
nature of Enron.  have a think about it, and if you want to folow up, on a=20
completely informal and no commitment basis, let me know.  Even if you do no=
t=20
want to leave, it's good to know what your market worth is!!

Lunch some time?=20

Brendam
