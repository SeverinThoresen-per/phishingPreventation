Subject: Outstanding Invoices


Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this=20
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked=20
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you ha=
ve
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

=20
