This counterparty's line of business is the distribution of pornography.  I =
asked Robbi Rossi her thoughts, and legal is OK with the deal because there =
is no illegality (as long as it does not involve child pornography).  Jane h=
as the company's tax returns.  It is a 1 year on-net OC-12 from Seattle to S=
an Jose plus local loop with an MRC of 22K per month.  This is a transaction=
 which accoriding to our guidelines we would approve with no credit language=
 in the GTCs due to size.  There is no income being marked on the deal.  I j=
ust wanted to be sure all parties are aware of what we are doing (Jim and Pa=
ul are aware per below message).  Clearly this is not credit risk; however, =
it seems plausible that there is the potential for this deal to reflect nega=
tively on Enron if it were to become known in the market that we were sellin=
g our network capacity to  customers in this line of business.

Thanks,
Tanya

Jane,

I asked Paul and Jim if there was a problem with doing a deal with Flying Cr=
ocodile, and the response was that we will deal with them so long as they co=
ntractually agree that they will not use the capacity for any unlawful purpo=
se (which is a standard clause in our agreement).  Therefore, we will move a=
head with this.  As I told you earlier, the mark on the long-haul is likely =
to be negative, and it is an on-net circuit so we can absorb it back if they=
 default.  The local loop is off-net, so I would imagine that you will want =
some protection on that side.  Let me know if you need anything else from me=
=2E

Thanks,
BG
