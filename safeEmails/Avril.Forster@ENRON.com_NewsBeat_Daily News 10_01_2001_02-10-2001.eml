Stora Enso launches EUR 365M pulp line at Imatra, Finland, mill complex

10/01/2001 12:45:48, Press Release=20


HELSINKI, Oct. 1, 2001 (press release) -- Stora Enso's Imatra mills form one=
 of Europe's largest wood processing complexes, which now includes Europe's =
largest integrated pulp mill, following the inauguration of the new fibre li=
ne there today. The new line produces bleached birch pulp for the company's =
own paper and board mills. The main products of the Imatra mills are liquid =
packaging boards, boards for the food and drinks industry and fine paper.=20

The new fibre line strengthens the Imatra mills' position as the only integr=
ated manufacturer of liquid packaging boards and boards for the food and dri=
nks industry. The mills produce all four different types of pulp required: b=
leached softwood pulp, bleached birch pulp, unbleached softwood pulp and the=
rmomechanical pulp.

The new fibre line meets the latest environmental standards and optimises us=
age of raw materials. Water consumption has been decreased by dry debarking =
and the introduction of modern, efficient fibre production technology. Efflu=
ent discharges into waterways have been reduced. Odours have also been reduc=
ed by more effective recovery and processing of malodorous gases, which are =
utilised in producing the impregnation solution for thermomechanical pulping=
=2E The new production lines will be quieter, too.

Increased black liquor combustion will raise the proportion of energy genera=
ted from biofuels at the Imatra mills to 85%.=20

In addition to the new fibre line, the former birch pulping line at Imatra h=
as been modernized to produce pine pulp, and the bleached softwood pulping l=
ine at Kaukopaa has been shut down because it no longer met current producti=
on and environmental protection requirements. The project also included expa=
nsion of wood treatment, upgrading of the power plant and installation of a =
new pulp dryer. The total cost of the project was 365 million euros, and mos=
t of the new facilities were already in use in spring 2001....
