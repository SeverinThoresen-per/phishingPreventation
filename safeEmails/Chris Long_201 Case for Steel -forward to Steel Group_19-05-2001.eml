I continued meeting with USG officials on 201.  Today I met with Faryar=20
Shirzad, Dept. of Commerce Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.=20
Faryar is a friend from his days in the Senate. =20

Faryar again said that the interagency working group is philosophically=20
opposed to a 201 as a simple political solution and they are looking for=20
alternative approaches.  However, he noted that the industry is in crisis=20
(not from imports alone) and they want to seek long-term solution.  It was m=
y=20
sense that, unlike Competitive Analysis memo, the Administration is no longe=
r=20
relying on a 201 to secure support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). =20
Faryar reported that a 201 decision is several weeks away, but will made by=20
early summer.  The steel industry continues to push the Administration,=20
because they believe an Administration initiation carries more weight and=20
will more likely result in quotas.

The Senate Finance Committee Chair has said that July is "trade" month for=20
his committee, so the Administration may want to announce their intentions=20
before then.  The Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley (R-IA)said that=
=20
he was "reluctant" to vote on 201 in his Committee and said the steel=20
industry should work with the Administration or file its own private=20
action.   This has not stopped Sen. John Rockefeller (D-WV) from encouraging=
=20
Finance Committee action.

The Administration could potentially initiate a 201 investigation and if har=
m=20
is found they can seek quotas or other alternative.  As noted above the=20
Administration is looking to the alternative, one is that the industry would=
=20
be forced to restructure (this is the gamble that steel is willing to take).=
 =20
To that end, here are two action items:

1)  The Administration is looking a long-term structural change to the US=20
domestic steel industry and they asked for consuming industry ideas on legac=
y=20
cost, market restructuring (i.e. efficiency), and global competitiveness.  I=
f=20
the steel group has any ideas that we could turn into a document for=20
Administration use it would allow us to offer solutions and encourage other=20
alternative courses of action.=20
2) After we review possible solutions we can offer,  Ken, Jeff, or Steve=20
should make the calls to senior Administration officials (within the next tw=
o=20
weeks).=20

I will continue to monitor Administration and Congressional action.
