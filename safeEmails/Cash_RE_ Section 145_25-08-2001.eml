poration as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, p=
artnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (incl=
uding attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actu=
ally and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, s=
uit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the pers=
on reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the =
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no =
reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. The terminati=
on of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, convict=
ion, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itse=
lf, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a =
manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the b=
est interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action o=
r proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was =
unlawful.=20

(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a p=
arty or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or compl=
eted action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgm=
ent in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director,=
 officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the =
request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of anot=
her corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise again=
st expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by =
the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or su=
it if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably b=
elieved to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and=
 except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue=
 or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to =
the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or =
the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon appl=
ication that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the c=
ircumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to i=
ndemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court s=
hall deem proper.=20

(c) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporat=
ion has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action,=
 suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, =
or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be in=
demnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonab=
ly incurred by such person in connection therewith.=20

(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unles=
s ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in=
 the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present =
or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstance=
s because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in=
 subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, =
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such de=
termination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to =
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a=
 committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, =
even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if=
 such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion=
, or (4) by the stockholders.=20

(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director =
in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, su=
it or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disp=
osition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by=
 or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall u=
ltimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified b=
y the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including at=
torneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees =
and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the cor=
poration deems appropriate.=20

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted =
pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclu=
sive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advanceme=
nt of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockhold=
ers or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such perso=
n's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding suc=
h office.=20

(g) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on beh=
alf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of th=
e corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a d=
irector, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joi=
nt venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against=
 such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising ou=
t of such person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have=
 the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this sectio=
n.=20

ude, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (=
including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or m=
erger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power a=

stituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another co=
rporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stan=
d in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or s=
urviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constitu=
ent corporation if its separate existence had continued.=20

ervice as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which im=
poses duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee o=
r agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or benefi=
ciaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person re=
asonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiarie=
s of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not=
 opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this se=
ction.=20

(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted =
pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized o=
r ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer=

rs or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summa=
rily determine a corporation's obligation to advance expenses (including att=
orneys' fees).=20

THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN INDEMNIFICATION FOR ATTORNEYS'=
 FEES: (a) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the qu=
estions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service compe=
tently, (b) the likelihood that a particular retainer will preclude other em=
ployment by the attorney, (c) the fee customarily charged in the community f=
or similar services, (d) the amount involved in the litigation and the resul=
ts obtained, (e) the time limitations imposed by the litigation, (f) the nat=
ure and length of professional relationship with the client, (g) the experie=
nce, reputation and ability of the lawyer performing the services, and (h) a=
 consideration whether the fee is fixed or contingent. Galdi v. Berg, 359 F.=
