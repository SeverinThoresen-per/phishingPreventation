Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this mornin=
g:

1.	Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has=
 paid Enron.  I have not heard from Mark or Tom.  The LC expires on 12/28.

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If th=
e netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew t=
he LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to con=
tact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will w=
ait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in defa=
ult and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Cr=
edit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of =
a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give the=
m until Wednesday to renew.

6.	Niagra Mohawk/ENA, Metromedia energy/ENA, Simpson Tacoma/ENA, The Energy =
Authority/ENA, Energy Production/ENA, Rising Star Energy LLC/ENA - I am wait=
ing on payment history info from Leslie to see if we have any right to draw.=
   Could someone in credit confirm that we are in-the-money on all of these?

7.	City of Santa Clara - Harlan to send out default notice. =20
