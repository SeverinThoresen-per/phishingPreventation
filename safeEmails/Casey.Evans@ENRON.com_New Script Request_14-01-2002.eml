Guys,

New task......we are going to change the primary counterparty on all of our =
other existing counterparties in the East and West portfolios to the followi=
ng EPMI desk names:

EPMI-EAST-NPERF	(EPMI East Non Performance)
EPMI-WEST-NPERF	(EPMI West Non Performance)

Our goal is to have this done tomorrow.  I will provide you with a list of c=
ounterparties on which we will be changing all associated deals ASAP.

Let me know if you guys have any questions!
Thanks, as always!
Casey

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for =
the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet ide=
ntifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contrac=
ts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then =
need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books=
=2E  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the co=
unterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously th=
ese transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the =
P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value=
 will need to be in Schedule E.
