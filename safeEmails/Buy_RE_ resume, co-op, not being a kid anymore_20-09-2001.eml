I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, althoug=
h the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady h=
as her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You shou=
ld talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send=
 them all letters with a resume attached. Don't worry at all about your resu=
me right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutato=
rian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace whic=
h will help you a lot. You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell=
 for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharma=
ceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop sh=
ould be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad

Hey dad.  Just wanted to let you know that I went into my undergraduate care=
er services office today (just for the heck of it).  The lady was very helpf=
ul but sort of scared me.  At first she was snobby because I hadn't had any =
experience, but then she realized that I had a lot of skills from my courses=
 that would go on my resume and that I could include my Nantucket work and s=
tuff like that.  No chance of a job in England or Ireland though.  She said =
it would be too much work for her to start researching foreign companies.  S=
o I guess I'm gonna have to start going to seminars and stuff to get myself =
ready for job searching.  She's gonna help me with my resume, which I'll pro=
ably start on this weekend.  She said summer co-ops are very hard to come by=
 since more kids are looking and companies don't really want people for just=
 the summer.  But she said I'm lucky that I came in so early.!  So who knows=
=2E  =20

I also applied for engineering dean's host today.  The application process w=
as easy, and it kind of hurt my pride when I applied for CAS dean's host and=
 didn't get it, so I'll see if this goes any better.  It will just entail a =
few hours on Fridays in the spring, and I remember that we both found the de=
an's hosts very helpful when we went to my freshman Friday.  But I may not g=
et it, so oh well.  Rebecca has not woken up yet today.  It is 5:00.  She sa=
ys she has a headache.  It has been nice and quiet at least.  I returned a t=
extbook today (went and made copies of the pages i needed to save us the 35 =
bucks).  I accept cash or check.  Life is good and boring.  I have been very=
 productive the past few days, and I am happy the week is coming to an end. =
 I will try to have some fun this weekend.  OK that's it for now.  HOpe all'=
s well for you.  Write or call if you're bored/depressed.  Later skat! er.=20

Cheers big ears,=20
