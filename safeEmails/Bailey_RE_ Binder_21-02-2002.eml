Alan,

Sorry for the late response, but Tuesday, February 19th was my birthday, and=
 with the Monday holiday I decided to take a few extra days off.

But I am here today -- Thursday, February 21st.

If you have not got someone else to complete this task, I will be very happy=
 to help.

Let me know.
