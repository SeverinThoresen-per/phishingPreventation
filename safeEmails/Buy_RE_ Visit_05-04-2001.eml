We can help you interview. Bradford and Port can really help in this process=
 but its best if you screen them first. As far as dates go we have an Enron =
BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us. This meeting is in early May, s=
o after mid April it starts to get crazy. It would be easier for me if you g=
ave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate. Rick

Rick,
I think what would work best is a half to full day in Houston.  Then a month=
 or two later to do a check up.
This will allow us to tell you where we think we are, where we need to be an=
d have you guys think about whether you would suggest anything different.=20
Over the next few weeks could you suggest a few times that might work. =20

In certain circumstances,  i would like to be able to have someone either w/=
i your group or perhaps a related group (e.g. kaminski) help in the intervie=
w process.  In fact,   I have a few candidates cueing up.  One is a PHD, Art=
 Mazer of CL&P and i would love to be able to throw him past one of your guy=
s.  I was thinking David Port.  Do you think i could borrow him for a phone =
interview.   I would like to do this asap so any input would be greatly appr=
eciated.  Apparently, this candidate knows a few people w/i Enron and i'd li=
ke to run the traps on this  He does not claim that these are great ref's be=
cause he worked or knew them in limited capacity but any insight is valuable=
=2E   The names of the two people are Art Bieser (apparently worked at Enter=
gy for a short time with him) and Alex Huang who he interviewed for a job at=
 Entergy but choose Enron.  We would need to keep this on a P&C basis.=20

I had dinner with Marc Tarkington on Wednesday.  I tried to entice him but i=
ts highly unlikely given he is paid quite well and the credit role here is s=
omewhat unique.  He sends his best regards to you.

Thanks,
Bill
