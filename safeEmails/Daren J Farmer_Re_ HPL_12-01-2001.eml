Hey, Ken.

Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.  We will have a Texas Desk, but I=20
don't really want to continue here.  I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp,=20
Paper, Lumber, Steel).  I will most likely interview with AEP to see what=20
they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the=20
Evil Empire.  I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.  Some folks are=
=20
upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.

Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.  Cole=20
loved everything.  He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to=20
an end.  Jake is a little different.  We spent $60 on a couple of things for=
=20
him.  He hasn't touched them more than twice.  He found his new favorite toy=
=20
the day after Christmas:  it's one of those soft cooler things you carry you=
r=20
lunch in.  He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it=20
around everywhere.  Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up=20
more room in our already crowded house.

We started our house hunting last week.  I think this is going to be a long=20
process.  Tonya's out looking today.  I'm letting her make the first cut.  I=
=20
will come in on the second round.  We will probably put our house on the=20
market in a couple of weeks.  We have a few small things we want to clean up=
,=20
fix, etc., before we list it.  According to the other sales in the=20
neighborhood, we should make a little money.

I hope everything is going well with you and the family. =20

Later.
