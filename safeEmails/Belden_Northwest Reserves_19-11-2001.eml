We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds. =
 $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the=
 LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the pot=
ential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December=
 of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugen=
e Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all fi=
led claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 =
million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For =
example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchas=
es which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with thi=
s process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark =
pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reve=
rse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk=
=2E

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposu=
re using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve ro=
ughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a d=
raft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refun=
ds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commission=
ers for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is appr=
oved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.
