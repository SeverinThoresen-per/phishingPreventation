	Shelley, wanted to pass this on to you.  Mike and I just talked about this =
and we are going
	to work with Richard and Reyna to be sure this cannot happen in the future.=
  (One of those
	surprises we were talking about earlier today).  Thanks. Lynn

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenie=
nt for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in =
place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?=20

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR =
balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on=
 TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW =
has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquir=
ed about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?  =20
