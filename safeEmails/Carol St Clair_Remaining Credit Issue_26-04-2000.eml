Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA=
=20
Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the=20
original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time=20
exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequen=
t=20
transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set u=
p=20
a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me=20
know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks.
