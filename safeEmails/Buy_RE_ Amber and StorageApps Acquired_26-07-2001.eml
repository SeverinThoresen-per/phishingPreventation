Subject:	Amber and StorageApps Acquired

In a absolutely dead tech market, two of the EBS portfolio companies announc=
ed they were being acquired today.  StorageApps is being acquired by Hewlett=
 Packard for $350 million, and Amber Networks is being acquired by Nokia for=
 $421 million.  If I am not mistaken, these are the 2 largest technology acq=
uisitions of 2001 (where only a handful of acquisitions have been made in to=
tal all year).

Net gains to Enron on both of these investments (which were both made in 200=
0) will be small, but the acquisitions are a verification of EBS Ventures ab=
ility to pick the best telecom investments in the market (no other single in=
vestor is in both of these deals).  Steven Sheldon and Patrick Hickey deserv=
e tremendous credit for originating and managing these investments.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland
Enron Principal Investments
