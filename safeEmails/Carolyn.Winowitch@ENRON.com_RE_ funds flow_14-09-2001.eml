Tracy, it looks like it is because of the estimate we used for the July cash

item that caused this.=20

Sorry Tracy, I can't come up with the reason behind the July change of $11=20

yesterday so will be out until Sept. 11. I can't find the source of the=20
amount that is hardcoded in the spreadsheet - she must have combined=20
something. One thought was TOLI, but it was flat in July. I have two other=20
people who might be able to help me on vacation this week as well.=20

There was a big change in the Funds Flow number you submitted for the 3Q in=20
August from the 3Q you submitted last month. Can you tell me what the change=

is due to?=20

Thanks=20
