Matt,
=20
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of=
=20
us will get back to you. =20

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing=20
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the=20
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely fro=
m=20
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605=20
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were=20
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods=20
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in=20
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary=20
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with=20
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without=20
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for=20
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand=20
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has=20
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt=20
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo),=20
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

    Britt

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and=20
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue,=20
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang=20
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this=20
e-mail.=20

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end=
=20
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt=
,=20
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want=
=20
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by=20
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important=20
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are=20
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was=20
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another=
=20
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it=20
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel=20
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First=20
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument ma=
y=20
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we=20
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing woul=
d=20
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample=20
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minto=
n=20
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club.=
=20
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to=20
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing=20
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas,=20
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method=20
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That=20
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it i=
s=20
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas.=20

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D360=
5=20
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to us=
e=20
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test=20
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want t=
o=20
have his input for the contamination issue.=20

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt







I also note Janice's preference to source for US experts to assist us on the=
