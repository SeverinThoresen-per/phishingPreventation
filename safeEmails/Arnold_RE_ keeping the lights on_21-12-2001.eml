Only took me 3 weeks to respond.  That's pretty good for me.  I think things=
 started collapsing the day I got your original email.  Obviously not an opp=
ortune time to come take the tour right now.  Not so impressive when the bui=
lding is 80% empty.  If/when we get the operation started again, I'll bring =
you up for a tour.
