Group,
When doing a buy-resale with Pacificorp, we need to agree on the buy and the=
 resale prices on the phone.  These prices need to be recorded in your trade=
 log.  We also need to now check the prices nightly on buy-resales with Paci=
ficorp when doing the SAR.  We are having numerous discrepancies with Pacifi=
corp because of problems with buy-resale deal entry.  I have listened to sev=
eral tapes where only the spread ($10 or $20 dollars) is mentioned.  Let's b=
e sure to  establish these prices, do the confirms nightly, and make sure we=
 can continue to work closely with this counterparty.=20

On a separate note...please be sure to use two tags on any buy-resales.

Thanks.

Bill
