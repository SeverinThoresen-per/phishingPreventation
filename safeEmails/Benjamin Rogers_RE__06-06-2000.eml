Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the ga=
s=20
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to=
=20
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are=20
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are=
=20
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not=20
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as=20
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered t=
o=20
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and=20
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their=20
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.
Ben
