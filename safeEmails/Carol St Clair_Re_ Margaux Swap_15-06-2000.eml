		 Subject: Margaux Swap


 John Hancock is insisting that we resurrect the termination for
illegality provision from the Master and put it in the Swap assignment
agreement as an option for the Trust to terminate the Swap and trigger an
appraisal if there is an illegality event.  Does Enron have an institutional
problem with this if the commercial and legal people are comfortable with it
here in London?
