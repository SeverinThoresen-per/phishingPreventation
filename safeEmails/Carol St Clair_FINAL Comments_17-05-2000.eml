Adele and Maria:
Here are my final comments:

1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day=
=20
waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes=20
effective?

2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.

3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just lik=
e=20
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs=
=20
to UCP.

That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the=20
Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final=20
versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your=20
opinion shortly. =20
