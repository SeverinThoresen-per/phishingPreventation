OK Kerry  -- here is the high level summary

My net cuts for Global Services   -- across the DPR team, Global Counterpart=
y, Contracts and OPM -- by Business unit

EGM  900,000
EIM   300,000
EA    100,000   -- less dpr service -- no global standards reporting etc
----------------------
$  1,300,000   total cut  -- pure salaries  -- not loaded with benefits or a=
ny overheads/bonus or anything

You will have to net off severance for about $400,000 worth of salary that i=
s 8 employees  ($224k for 8 people at avg $28k per person)  the rest are con=
tractors or positions that were budgeted for which we will not fill, or peop=
le who will be re-deployed into EES  I assume that HR gave you some average =
rate

Kerry will assume you will add the rest on to this


EES there is no net savings  -- for every single person that I am severing  =
-- we are re-deploying someone from EIM or EGM into the role.    But there w=
ill be severance costs for another 20 ($560k at avg $28k per person)     peo=
ple who's salaries total about $ 900,000   --- this should be the same sever=
ance that was avoided in EIM or EGM -- as their people are moving over to fi=
ll these spots

Please call with questions
