John,

I am performing code updates to the stand-alone EOL workstation WNAEOL-48101=
 this evening and wanted to check with you to see at which point it would be=
 convenient for you.  I assume after the business day would be acceptable an=
d my intent is to start near 6:00 p.m. or, at any time you decide is conveni=
ent for you.
I called a short while ago and will do so again before proceeding, but if yo=
u receive this email and need to contact me, you may reach me at extension 5=
-7004.  Thanks.

Chris Jeska
