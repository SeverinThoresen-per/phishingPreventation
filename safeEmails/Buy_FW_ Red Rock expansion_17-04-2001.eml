The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting. =
 The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for app=
roval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would recom=
mend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that Rod c=
oordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee meeti=
ngs.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we can d=
ecide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation needs=
 to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he wants=
 a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it himself.
