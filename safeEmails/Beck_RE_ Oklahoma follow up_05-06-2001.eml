Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out a=
t our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your=
 efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out =
to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The informati=
on regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended up being =
a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams not our w=
eather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives unde=
rway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the individual u=
niversities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds and are ad=
ministered by employees here with some assistance by Community Relations and=
 University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an effort like thi=
s for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the details.
