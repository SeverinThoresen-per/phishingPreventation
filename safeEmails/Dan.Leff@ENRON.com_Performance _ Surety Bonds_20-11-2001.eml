As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficu=
lt for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example=
, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payme=
nts bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with=
 the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in=
 force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in al=
l aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where w=
e have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, statu=
s, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to =
make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases /=
 decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue t=
o flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan
