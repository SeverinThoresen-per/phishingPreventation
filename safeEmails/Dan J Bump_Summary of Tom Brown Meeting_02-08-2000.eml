I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met wit=
h=20
the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard.=20

1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come u=
p=20
with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al)=20
currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin.

2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (an=
d=20
other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity=20
for Wildhorse.

3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the=20
Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development=
=20
ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very=20
familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on=20
to Ken/Jim).

4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for th=
e=20
past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder=20
Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in thei=
r=20
LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now=
=20
being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are=20
successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and loo=
k=20
to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to=20
third party purchasers.

This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard=
=20
to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been=20
slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4=20
above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to=20
Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status o=
f=20
the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction=20
between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until thei=
r=20
transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of=20
course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they=20
would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI=20
negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the=20
system is divested?

The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to=20
Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time=20
deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in=20
writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the=20
event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out?=20

I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of=
=20
any developments.

Thanks.

Dan
