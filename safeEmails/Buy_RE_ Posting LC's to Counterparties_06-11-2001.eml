It's about 2.5 million dollars (cash not LC), and this helps us cover a shor=
t position we need to cover.  I want to do this deal.

What do you want to about this?  This is tying up capital when we are a litt=
le bit short on capital.

John:

Appreciate seeing the old e-mail again, but remind you that the Shenhua carg=
o was agreed 22 Oct.  As mentioned, we will certainly try to push Shenhua to=
 entertain alternative arrangements, but the Chinese are usually quite diffi=
cult on this subject (to date, all Chinese cargoes have required Enron to po=
st an LC).  It's a good idea to get Shankman thinking about this one today, =
because it is likely that we will need to post an LC for this cargo.  If tim=
ing is an issue, I'm sure we can drag the process out a few weeks since deli=
very is not until mid-Jan.

Regardless, need your input as soon as possible on whether we can continue t=
ransacting business where cash collection is not coincident (or in advance o=
f) cash out the door.

Thks,

Stu

As per the e-mail below, RAC must be contacted prior to transacting on an L/=
C basis.  This was the same message I conveyed to the Australian team early =
last week.  The Shenhua deal definitely falls within the description and is =
an issue to be resolved.

I will talk to Jeff Shankman today about the use of L/Cs and capital in the =
near future, and see what resolution can be reached with the positions and s=
trategy you hold in your book.

In this current climate we should try wherever possible not to commit to pos=
ting collateral to counterparties for physical purchases of product unless a=
bsolutely necessary.  We should offer an Enron Corp guarantee as an alternat=
ive.  In the event that we are asked to post security to a counterparty woul=
d you please contact credit before doing so.
The credit hotline number is 36555

thanks for your co-operation.
