Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in=20
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would=20
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any=
=20
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances=20
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer perio=
d=20
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/ED=
I=20
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

d.n.
