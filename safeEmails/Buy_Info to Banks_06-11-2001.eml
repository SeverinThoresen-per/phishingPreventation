We are trying to get the banks out of our hair a little bit here so let me k=
now if there are any more requests for info and don't send anything to them =
without clearing it with me first. I will run sensitive stuff past Lavo and =
then try to let the banks know they have enough know. They are calling peopl=
e directly now and we need to stop that. Thanks, Rick
