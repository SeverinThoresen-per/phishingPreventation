I have received a note from UBS to say they have not received your employeme=
nt application form.  Pls completed the attached form and return to me.   Pl=
ease ensure the following:

1.	You put city and state in the school/college section=20
2.	You complete a 10 year history of work (if in College/not working/ etc  p=
lease state with dates).
