I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a li=
fetime or two ago!! =20

Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with Teddy was perhaps a preview =
of the subsequent weeks at Enron.  Thank goodness for those little guys to g=
o home to every night. =20

My little guys aren't so little any more.  Meagan is a senior this year - ha=
d all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty =
good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - Un=
iversity of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to=
 hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probab=
ly after the first of the year.  (By the way, David and I are strongly talki=
ng up the state school thing, given the current Enron share price, or dimini=
shed portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especi=
ally since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand ha=
ving spent way too many hours in the Enron Building.

And mentioning the building, I moved to Enron Center South (the new building=
) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinn=
eman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it i=
s not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a ma=
ze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some =
elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is =
cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continu=
e to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging d=
own.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, b=
ut we are here! =20

Do let me know if you are going to be in Houston anytime soon.  I would love=
 to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  =
my previously planned November London visit is not happening! =20

Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --Sally=20

Sally,
I  have been thinking of you and the first time we met at a conference in Ne=
w York.  Much more innocent times.=20

 To answer your question, I went to Euro Disney in october and I am scared o=
f rollercoasters.  However, Teddy being 8 years old, I had to go on them.  I=
 found Space Mountain (roller coaster in the dark) much easier to handle tha=
n a similar one where I actually could see the danger that I was putting mys=
elf in.
=20
While it must be difficult for your people, they could do a lot worse than h=
ave you in charge.  Good luck with this situation.  I hope to speak to you s=
oon.
Best to David and family.
Ted

Are we having some fun now?  Thought about you today - in fact, ran across a=
 business card of yours that I had in a file from Phibro Energy. =20

I know that I have missed your insight and opinions into Enron's roller-coas=
ter.  Is this ride better with eyes open or closed?  --Sally  =20
