Rod and Brant:
I finally received their revised draft of the Schedules.  They are still=20
insisting on an Additional Termination Event that gets triggered if there is=
=20
a MAC.  As defined, MAC means a rating that is below BBB- OR Baa3 or failure=
=20
to have a rating from either S&P OR Moody's.  I need your guidance on this. =
=20
MAC as defined in the CSA  which triggers the threshold going to zero works=20
the same way.  I seem to recall that from a credit standpoint, we were okay=20
with a MAC that would be triggered if either rating fell.  Is that correct?

Carol
