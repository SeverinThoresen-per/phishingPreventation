Sounds good.  The extra time may enable us to firm up our concepts, add=20
structures and beef up the presentation. =20

When pricing these structures, consider our long option position with the=20
LM6000's:  Since everything is notional, we could add 90 MW of unit=20
contingent calls starting next summer and an additional 200MW starting in 02=
=20
coming from LV Cogen.  Not terribly clean, but we should be a better offer=20
than the desk, and Sempra's bid may be better than the desk's bid.=20

Chris,

Jeff and I have spent some time discussing Sempra issues and decided to use=20
the meeting delay as an opportunity to develop some power price structures=20
that may be interesting to them. This is all driven by PG&E's recent move to=
=20
fix prices for upwards of 1,000 MW's.  The pressure will be on SDG&E and SCE=
=20
to do likewise.

 I will be in Portland on Monday and hope to get some time with you to=20
discuss this but wanted to provide you with a preview.

Jeff and I discussed some structures that might be attractive to Sempra give=
n=20
the regulatory and shareholder risk they face should they (1) continue to bu=
y=20
power at market prices and/or (2) lock in a fixed price:=20
(a) costless collar,
(b) fixed price coupled with writing long-dated puts, and=20
(c) price cap.

These structures are intended to address Sempra's risk exposure.  Our=20
underlying understanding is:
1)  Continued purchases @ market exposes Sempra to substantial regulatory an=
d=20
shareholder risk,
2)  Fixing the price mitigates both of these risks,
3)  A costless collar arguably keeps Sempra in the market limiting their=20
exposure to higher prices but allowing them to benefit from lower prices,
4)  Writing the put generates a premium which can be applied to lower a fixe=
d=20
price, and
5)  Holding a call eliminates their exposure to high prices and allows them=20
to benefit from lower prices.

With that said, I expect the cost of the call to be huge.  However, the=20
costless collar and fixed price with a put could be attractive.  The only=20
problem with collars is that our bid-offer spread typically skews the band=20
such that if the underlying price were $50, a cap with a $70 strike would be=
=20
associated with a $40 strike on the put.

Our thought was to get some notional prices and but together a few plots to=20
illustrate how these products work.
=20
What do you think?

Laird
