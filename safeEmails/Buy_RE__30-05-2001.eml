David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the=
 policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't =
think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so t=
he allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to=
 come. Rick
