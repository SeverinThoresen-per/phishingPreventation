These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) =
or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (1667=
64) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201=
), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or E=
NA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks
