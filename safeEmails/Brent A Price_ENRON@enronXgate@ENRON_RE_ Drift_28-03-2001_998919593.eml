Louise - Let me clarify a point I obviously mangled in my previous email.  W=
e are going to change Gary's Drift allocation amounts to North America.  I t=
alked to Mike about this yesterday and he agrees the current allocation is a=
ggressive.  I need to talk to Gary on Thursday about these changes and if no=
thing else, give him a heads up that we are going to do this.  The costs all=
ocated to you related to Drift will definitely be reduced and I will have th=
e revised numbers for you on Thursday. =20

Regards,=20

Brent

Clearly this is an incorrect allocation.  Gary is allocating North America f=
or 19 people for just managing drift.

It has now taken two months to get nowhere on this issue.

I revert back to Mike for resolution on this.

Louise - Current status on Drift expense allocations....  We have reviewed t=
he $11.8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodolog=
y being used by Gary to allocate costs.  When Gary is back in the office on =
Thursday, I will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need=
 to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages.  I w=
ill let you know the outcome of that meeting.

Also, keep in mind that the $11.8 million represents a Plan amount.  Actuals=
 should be much less since we are currently well under Plan headcount amount=
s and not all Plan expenses have been made.  Let me know if you have any que=
stions - I will keep you updated.

Regards,

Brent

Mike and I have discussed the Drift plan and clearly there was an allocation=
 issue somewhere along the line.  Please let us have our new numbers.

Thanks

Louise
