CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have=20
decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp.=20
(ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said=20
Wednesday.=20
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose t=
o=20
deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of=
=20
their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The=20
municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we=20
could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois," Chicago Mayo=
r=20
Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.=20
The government coalition sent out a request for proposals to the state's 13=20
registered electricity providers last summer requesting bids for cheaper=20
power, and also for power that's generated with 20% renewable supplies.=20
Combined, the municipalities currently pay ComEd about $110.6 million a year=
=20
for 400 megawatts of power, most of which comes from nuclear and coal-fired=20
power plants.=20
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the=20
renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill=20
gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with=20
another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants,=
=20
and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are=20
expected to go into effect this year.=20
Terms of the power deals weren't announced, as about 4,000 accounts between=20
municipal agencies and the two power providers must still be ironed out, cit=
y=20
officials said.=20
But the government groups do have a target for savings. Chicago, which uses=20
about 200 megawatts and pays ComEd about $50 million annually for power,=20
expects to save a net $3 million a year through a combination of cheaper=20
power from Enron and more expensive renewable power from ComEd. Once all the=
=20
accounting is completed, it's likely the municipal groups will save up to $5=
=20
million in total each year, the city estimates.=20
"Enron gave us the most competitive price," Daley said.

Some analysts are even saying LNG's share of the U.S. gas market could tripl=

"Significant new investment in LNG to serve U.S. markets will probably be=20

"The LNG market makes for a good science fiction story because it's this=20

Total U.S. import capacity of LNG is about 1.0 tcf per year, or about 4=20

If all the new projects being contemplated do materialize, LNG may feed 8=20

Last year, U.S. demand for natural gas was about 22.7 tcf and is projected t=

As long as natural gas prices stay above the $3.50/$4.00 per mmBtu range, LN=

With such bullish gas projections, companies are revamping existing LNG=20

India's Vajpayee Says Enron's Power Costs Too Much, AFP Reports
2001-06-06 12:30 (New York)


     Mumbai, June 6 (Bloomberg) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said it would be difficult to find buyers for
power produced by Dabhol Power Co., a local unit of Enron Corp.,
because it's too expensive, the Agence France Presse reported.
    ``The difficulty (about the high cost of power) facing
Maharashtra will be for other states as well. What is to be done
about such costly power?'' AFP quoted Vajpayee as saying.
     Dabhol and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, are in a dispute over power rate. The board has stopped
buying power from Dabhol after the U.S. energy company began steps
to terminate a $3 billion power venture.
     Still, Vajpayee said he was hopeful the dispute will be
resolved. ``The dispute is on the way to being resolved. I am
confident the government of Maharashtra and Enron will come to a
solution,'' he said.
     Indian banks that funded Dabhol and foreign lenders extended
a meeting into a third day, after initially planning a two-day
meeting in Singapore, to try and save the power project from
closure.
     Indian banks, which have loaned $1.4 billion to the project,
have most at stake in the project and are seeking ways to keep it
alive. International lenders received government guarantees for
about $600 million they lent to the project.
