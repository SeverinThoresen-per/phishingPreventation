Should we call PG&E, or do you want someone on your desk to make the call?

Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some =
of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on=
 the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value=
 for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Productio=
n Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	     =
 172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we =
have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	    =20


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause f=
uture loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so=
 we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	     =
 172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will =
be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if y=
ou have any questions.  Thanks.
