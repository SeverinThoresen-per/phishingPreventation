Ricki, it might be quicker to re-create the timeline.  I can give you a colo=
red copy so you
can keep it identical to the one we have.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn I have a few hard copies of the old ET&S timeline that I created in 98.=
  I remember I was on vacation when I created it because Donna was faxing ch=
anges to my house.  Wish me luck trying to find it in that mess, everything =
is in boxes.  I know it's on a diskette somewhere, so please bear with me.  =
If I can't find it, should I recreate it, and if so, are there any changes.

Thanks,
Ricki
