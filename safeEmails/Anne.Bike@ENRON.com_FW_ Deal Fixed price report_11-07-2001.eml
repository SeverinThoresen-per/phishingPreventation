Dave:  The Deal Fixed Price Report has been a very valuable tool.  Thank you=
 and Krishna for your efforts.  I have a question for you regarding our tran=
sition into multiple books and how it will affect the report.  Beginning in =
July the West desk will have several physical books instead of just the one =
ENA-IM West book.  The new books are as follows:

ENA - IM WKEYSTON
ENA - IM WPGE
ENA - IM WROCKIES
ENA - IM WSJ
ENA - IM WSOCAL

We would like to be able to run one report that captures all five of the new=
 books in one report as opposed to having to run five separate reports.  In =
the position manager for SITARA, we have all five books roll up into one nam=
ed West Intramonth Position.  Would it be possible to have something similar=
 for this report ?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thank you.

Anne Bike
