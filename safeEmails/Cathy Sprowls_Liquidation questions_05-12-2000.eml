Phillip and/or Kam,

Jim Little booked some liquidation pmas in 10/00 GL for 05/00 production for=
=20
Central region.  I'm not able to tie these taggs to a Sitara deal so I'm not=
=20
sure what to do with them.  Can you help?

ND2875.3     Consumers Gas  93,000 revenue  Jim says this should probably be=
=20
reclassed to Ontario, but I don't have any open issues related to Ontario an=
d=20
I       don't know what the Sitara link is.

EC3704.7     Enron Canada            19,848 revenue  The tagg references=20
Sitara #313723 but when I try to open it, I get an access denied message, an=
y=20
clues what this       is?=20

ND9423.1    Enron Canada 23,249 revenue I didn't see a Sitara reference on=20
this tagg, either.

He also booked a pma for 760,000 of expense for Consumers on tagg NF9881.1=20
but it looks to me like we've already booked this one in the original=20
liquidation file, so I've asked him to research that one.

Thanks for your help.

Cathy
