Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi=20
Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.

I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2=20
companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700). =
=20
Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not=20
make them an offer.

Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.

But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first. =20

Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat=
=20
with.

I get you more scoop later.
