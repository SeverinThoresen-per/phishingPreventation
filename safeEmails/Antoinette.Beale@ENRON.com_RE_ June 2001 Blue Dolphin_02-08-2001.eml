Darren,

Thank you for such a prompt response. When looking in the Volume Management,=
 I saw volume scheduled in ENA and ENA Upstream.  I actualized in ENA  and I=
 heard that Blue Dolphin will go to upstream starting July production month.=
  Could you confirm which entity for the month of June? =20

Thanks!

Antoinette

I spoke with Nelson Ferries today.  We are responsible for the transport fee=
s on Blue Dolphin for June.  I have pathed the volumes in Unify.  Please loo=
k into this and let me know if you have any questions.  Additionally, I inpu=
t the purchase and sale deals that were not in the system.  Can you please i=
nform the appropriate person in settlements to handle those deals?

Thanks.

George,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of  June 2001 Blue Dolphi=
n. You stated on Tuesday that Enron was not responsible for June.  Could you=
 update me on any information you have acquired?


Thanks!
