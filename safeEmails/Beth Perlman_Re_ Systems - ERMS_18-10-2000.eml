John,

These issues are being addressed by Steve Stock and Chris Hanz in my area as=
=20
well as people on the infrastructure side (in Jenny Rub's organization).  We=
=20
understand the significance of these problems and they have not gone=20
unrecognised.  There are 3 components to this plan, the DBA fixes are noted=20
below (I know it's a lot of technical terms, but this is a highly complex=20
problem).  The other 2 pieces are the application and the hardware.  I will=20
include these plans as soon as I receive them.

My team stayed last night with Jeff Gossett and his folks.  A number of item=
s=20
came out of observing what transpires in risk.  We feel that there are many=20
performance enhancements that can be made to the macros to speed up non ERMS=
=20
processing.   I'll keep you posted on what we find and the plans to fix them=
=2E

Beth



Database Observed Problems

=A3 OS - Severe I/O contention (due to 6 years old disk storage device)
=A3 OS - Max CPU utilization (due to wait I/O contention)
=A3 DB - Redo Log Sync (synchronization of Redo information memory with disk=
)
=A3 DB - Shared Pool fragmentation (due to unbound SQL )
=A3 DB - Inefficient buffer cache utilization (due to inefficient SQL)


Recommendation

Short Term

=A3 Alleviate Shared Pool contention
- increased Shared Pool size
- disabled MTS
- increased session_cached_cursors
Implemented on 10/15/2000

=A3 Alleviate Redo Log Sync
- increased redo_log_buffer
Implemented on 10/15/2000

=A3 Alleviate I/O contention for rollback segment tablespace
- added additional tablespace with 2/3more rollback segments
Implemented on 10/17/2000

=A3 Alleviate I/O contention for redo logs
- reorg disk storage and implement striping for Redo logs
- turn on force direct I/O write for intensive volumes
Under investigation =01) 2 days work

=A3 Turn on Veritas tuning feature
- expect 5% improvement
- tested on Shemp today
Required system reboot=20

=A3 SQL Tuning=20
Deliver Lists of expensive SQL with recommendation by 10/27/2000

=A3 Reassess CPR migration to different UNIX host
Waiting for disk storage =01) 2 to 3 weeks
       New 10K located in Ardmore

Long Term

=A3 Latest storage technology

=A3 Capacity planning

=A3 ERMT and CPR application review

=A3 Upgrade ERMT to 8I

John -

Again,  we are having "big time" systems issues.  While we are having the=20
usual length of time issues (a few people were here past midnight last=20
night), the issues that occured last night are much more serious than in the=
=20
past.  The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few=20
books.  (Positions,  value,  etc.)  Luckily, these errors were all caught=20
last night,  but if a less experienced person had been on those books,  it=20
could have been a disaster.  (Traders getting incorrect positions and p&l an=
d=20
interest rate and credit getting incorrect numbers.)  I have contacted those=
=20
in ERMS that need to be involved,  but I would appreciate it if you could=20
provide additional support to this effort.

Thanks,

Jeff
