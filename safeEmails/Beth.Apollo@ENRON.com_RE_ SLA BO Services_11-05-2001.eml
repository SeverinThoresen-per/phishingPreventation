Fred   -- I think this looks good.  Frank and I briefly discussed yesterday.=
  Can you bring to the wider group on Monday to get their input.

Remember to encourage them not too be too detailed, as that will be hard to =
administrate, but hopefully they have some input on the commitments we have =
included.

Beth

PS can you schedule a meeting mid to late next week after Frank incorporates=
 this info into the contract for the 3 of us to review?  I am out at a confe=
rence on Monday and Tuesday

 << File: Services and Service Level Agreement.doc >>=20
Here's a copy of the latest draft of the service levels that we may expect t=
o adhere to. We might also start to think about what would happen if we don'=
t meet the performance levels indicated.  What do we offer up?  How will it =
be handled.  This could possible be addressed in a separate section.

See you later today,
