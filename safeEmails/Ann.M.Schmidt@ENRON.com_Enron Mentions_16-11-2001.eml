With its stock falling to new lows and its credit rating battered, energy gi=
ant Enron is desperately searching for new capital. Sources close to the Hou=
ston company say it's considering deals with other energy-trading companies,=
 private-equity firms, and blue-chip saviors such as GE Capital. The Wall St=
reet Journal and CNBC reported that Dynegy is in merger talks with Enron. Th=
e company's financial crisis was sparked by disclosures about some of its of=
f-balance-sheet partnership deals negotiated by former Chief Financial Offic=
er Andrew Fastow. A Securities & Exchange Commission investigation and the t=
hreat of liabilities from shareholder lawsuits could make it tough for Enron=
 to land a new investor.

See you in court

The Economist
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economist; Source: World Reporter (TM) - FT McCarthy

The company's trials have just begun=20
LAWYERS are swarming all over Enron's old financial statements and press rel=
eases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation. More than=
 20 class-action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks, and new ones are =
popping up every day. A formal process has been started to consolidate litig=
ation in Houston, where the troubled energy company is based, with all lawye=
rs interested in the case required to stake their claims by December 21st.
The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal w=
ays of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This wee=
k, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance p=
ackage worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems "had been=
 exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balan=
ce sheet". America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking =
again at off-balance-sheet financing, having fretted about it on and off for=
 a decade.=20
There will also be charges of insider trading, because even as Enron was iss=
uing securities amid glowing profits reports, top executives were dumping ov=
er $1 billion of Enron shares to "unsuspecting investors", a group that incl=
udes anybody who, however briefly, has held one of the company's 750m shares=
 in the past two years. "The number of class members will be huge," says Mau=
rice Pesso, a lawyer at a New York firm that has filed a claim.=20
There are, however, limits to the company's liability. It has already restat=
ed its results going back five years, but federal law restricts litigation t=
o the past three. Moreover, Enron will not take the rap alone. Its auditor, =
Arthur Andersen (now plain Andersen), is also named as a defendant in at lea=
st one of the complaints already filed. The litigation comes after a rough d=
ecade for Andersen. It has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in set=
tlements after sloppy audits on such companies as Waste Management, Sunbeam =
and Discovery Zone.=20
Because Enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm, it becam=
e much like an unregulated bank. The lack of supervision meant that the role=
 of the company's auditor was crucial. Andersen was certainly paid as if it =
was. In 2000, it collected $25m for auditing Enron's books and another $27m =
for consulting services. Now how do you account for that?

Did Ken Lay Understand What Was Happening at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/16/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WHAT a tangled web was weaved by Enron. Both investors and managers seem to =
have been misled.=20
''Enron became overleveraged,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief e=
xecutive, said this week, adding that things went wrong in ways that ''I cou=
ld not have ever contemplated.'' He pointed to investments that ''performed =
far worse than we ever could have imagined.''
That was the first time that Enron had admitted it had a leverage problem, a=
nd it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others.=
 Mr. Lay says he understood what was going on, but I suspect he had left cru=
cial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the r=
eality that was obscured by Enron's soothing financial statements.=20
When Enron was riding high, it could easily have sold stock to raise capital=
 that it now desperately wants. Mr. Lay and other executives sold stock, but=
 the company did not. Just a month ago, Mr. Lay spoke enthusiastically of ho=
w great the company's continuing earnings were.=20
The leverage was not easy to find. A lot of it was carried off Enron's balan=
ce sheet. Partnerships and special-purpose entities that Enron set up borrow=
ed money and funneled the cash to Enron. Enron guaranteed the debt but did n=
ot have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obliga=
tions by issuing stock. As undisclosed losses built up in those entities, it=
 became more likely they could not pay their bills, leaving Enron to do so.=20
It is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand Enron's pl=
ight until the last couple of weeks. When they figured it out, it took a $1.=
5 billion equity infusion that is part of the Dynegy takeover to keep Enron'=
s rating above junk level.=20
Now Enron has a board committee investigating various transactions, and prom=
ises to release details as they are uncovered. Officials speak as if they ar=
e learning what happened for the first time, and perhaps they are. Jeffrey S=
killing, Mr. Lay's protege, was Enron's chief financial engineer until he qu=
it this summer. And Enron's chief financial officer and treasurer were ouste=
d as Enron unraveled.=20
Some investors would say none of that matters now, that the only important f=
act is that Dynegy is buying Enron anyway. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief exec=
utive, is convinced that Enron's energy trading business is a gem that more =
than justifies the price Dynegy is paying. He figures the losses from the ba=
d investments can be contained.=20
The big question now may be whether Mr. Watson will retain his enthusiasm af=
ter his people study Enron's trading positions. Enron has always said it hed=
ged its big derivative positions -- positions that can contain huge leverage=
 that does not show up on the balance sheet -- but some of that hedging was =
with affiliated companies. If big surprises are found, Dynegy could back out=
 of the deal.=20
There is plenty of blame to go around here, and suits have been filed agains=
t Enron, its current and former officials, and its auditor, Arthur Andersen.=
 But investors also bear responsibility. Enron's financial statements were, =
as Mr. Lay conceded this week, ''opaque and difficult to understand.'' Inves=
tors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on. They bought anyw=
ay.=20
Enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers. An old-line gas =
pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could app=
ly its magic around the world. Investors did not care how Enron made the num=
bers. Now, when it is too late, they do.

A Quick Change in Fortune Dulls the Glimmer of Houston
By JIM YARDLEY

11/16/2001
The New York Times
Page 14, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Nov. 15 -- On a day when oil prices plunged to two-year lows, when =
the hometown Enron Corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy =
projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch, Geo=
rge Alcorn lunched on Chilean sea bass at the downtown Petroleum Club and de=
cided that the sky was not falling.=20
''I've been an optimist all my life,'' said Mr. Alcorn, 69, who owns an inde=
pendent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid-1980'=
s. ''The opportunities in this town have always been large. I don't think it=
's going to change at all.''
That Mr. Alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is =
hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism. Unt=
il recently, economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing th=
e rest of the nation would largely bypass Houston, the nation's energy capit=
al. In June, The Economist magazine, citing Houston's increasingly diverse e=
conomy, even promoted it as a candidate for the world's next great internati=
onal city and business center.=20
But June is a long time ago. By then, the city had already lost 2,000 jobs f=
rom the struggling computer maker Compaq and will probably now lose thousand=
s more if the company's merger with Hewlett-Packard is approved. In the afte=
rmath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Continental Airlines, which is base=
d here, announced 12,000 layoffs, some likely to come in Houston. The Texas =
Medical Center, one of the largest medical complexes in the world, is facing=
 financial peril after flooding in June caused an estimated $2 billion in da=
mages.=20
The latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of =
Enron, the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy b=
efore a merger with its local rival, Dynegy, was announced last week. Even i=
f the merger goes through, the city is expected to feel a crunch; local real=
 estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office spac=
e at a time when new towers are under construction, including one by Enron.=20
One visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city's sports=
 stadiums, Enron Field and Compaq Center, are named for companies that soon =
may not exist. This week, the National Association of Purchasing Management,=
 which measures business activity and industrial production, released a repo=
rt showing that Houston's economy had contracted in October after 32 consecu=
tive months of expansion.=20
''Over the first half of this year, you had to feel pretty good,'' said Bill=
 Gilmer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and an authority=
 on Houston. But Mr. Gilmer said that much of the city's recent job growth w=
as driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the =
sector was ''running out of steam.''=20
''The national economy,'' Mr. Gilmer added, ''is not helping out right now.'=
'=20
The fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on Houston is, oddly e=
nough, evidence of the city's success in recovering from the 1980's oil bust=
=2E Then, with the local economy dominated by oil and gas, the drop in price=
s crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversifica=
tion. And it worked: Compaq, Continental, the Texas Medical Center as well a=
s dramatic growth in small business helped Houston recover and grow even fas=
ter, becoming the nation's fourth-largest city. The new generation of sophis=
ticated energy companies, led by Enron, then created a boom.=20
Economists say the next several months are likely to be slow. There could be=
 substantial layoffs if Compaq and Enron mergers take place. Mr. Gilmer said=
 the price of oil still played a large role in the city's economy; the numbe=
r of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1,000 from about 1,300 in recen=
t months.=20
Yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust, when downtown office buildin=
gs stood practically empty. Instead, economists point to a relatively quick =
rebound. Ray Perryman, a Texas economist who runs the Perryman Group, said H=
ouston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities, including th=
e city's bustling port, the nation's second largest. The city was recently n=
amed as one of four finalists to become the American entry to be host of the=
 2012 Olympic Games. Voters recently approved construction of a starter ligh=
t rail line, and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a pl=
an to greatly reduce air pollution.=20
''We're sitting here with over two million jobs,'' said former Mayor Bob Lan=
ier.=20
The downfall of Enron, though, a company whose value dropped almost 90 perce=
nt because of accounting problems and financial distress, has been the most =
highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city's economy. The company had=
 embodied the self-image that Houston business leaders hold dear: it was ent=
repreneurial, aggressive and ground breaking. It was also a generous civic b=
enefactor; the company's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a close friend of Preside=
nt Bush, had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate.=20
But this week, Enron's lost glory became painfully evident. In a hall at Ric=
e University on Tuesday, Mr. Lay presented Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reser=
ve chairman, with a lifetime achievement award, the Enron Prize, which Mr. L=
ay's company had endowed and named in flush times. The next morning, an arti=
cle in The Houston Chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the n=
ame of the prize would be changed.

Johnson and Longley Hurting Bottom Line
By Richard Sandomir

11/16/2001
The New York Times
Page 3, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Larry Johnson and Luc Longley are gone from the Knicks' roster, but clearly =
not forgotten by their former employers at Cablevision.=20
There will be no corporate tributes to Johnson, who retired, and Longley, wh=
o was waived. There will be no statues erected in their honor outside Madiso=
n Square Garden, a division of Cablevision.
But Johnson and Longley live on in Cablevision's third-quarter financial rep=
ort, even though their names go unmentioned. The Garden has paid them the $4=
8 million they had remaining on their contracts, then wrote them off because=
 they are no longer performing for their money; the players lost the value t=
hey had when they first arrived at the Garden. Now they are nonperforming as=
sets, not a small power forward and a bulky 7-foot-2-inch center.=20
At least Johnson was, for a time after his acquisition in 1996, a key part o=
f the team, even if his bad back kept him from scoring or rebounding as he h=
ad with the Charlotte Hornets. But the injured Longley's contribution last s=
eason was minuscule.=20
So the Garden, which was hurt by fewer shows at the Garden and Radio City Mu=
sic Hall, took a one-time hit and wrote off the value of Johnson's and Longl=
ey's contracts. For the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, the Garden's op=
erating cash-flow deficit was $32.4 million, compared with $29.6 million in =
operating cash flow last year for the same period. (Operating cash flow at C=
ablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortizati=
on.)=20
Insurance will cover some of the cost of the Johnson-Longley payouts.=20
''The team looks healthy,'' Jim Dolan, the president of Cablevision, said on=
 Tuesday during a conference call with analysts. ''I don't expect any more w=
rite-offs.''=20
Whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty pl=
ayer sustains a career-ending injury. But Cablevision could have avoided thi=
s financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of=
 Johnson and Longley. In each case, the Garden knew it was acquiring damaged=
 goods.=20
In his second season in Charlotte, Johnson hurt his back, and he has never b=
een the same. Maybe the Garden was swayed that he was well enough, because h=
e averaged 20.5 points and 8.4 rebounds in the season before it traded Antho=
ny Mason for him. But the persistence of his back problems in the last few s=
easons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place. The back =
compromised his skills, often limiting him to being a symbol of the Knicks' =
grit. He also spelled ''L'' with his bended arm quite nicely, yet not worth =
an average of $7 million a year.=20
When Longley arrived from Phoenix last year in the four-team deal that sent =
Patrick Ewing to Seattle, he said he had told the Knicks that he had a degen=
erative ankle condition.=20
''I brought up my ankle in my physical with the Knicks,'' he said in July, '=
'and they said, 'Have you been playing?' I said, 'Yes,' and that was it.'' T=
he fact was, he played for the Australian Olympic team in Sydney last year, =
but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing.=20
Should have been a tip-off.=20
The Naming Rights Dance=20
Enron Field, home of the Houston home run, is bound to be called something d=
ifferent next season when Jimy Williams starts his tenure as the Astros' man=
ager.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, agreed to pay $100 million to put =
its name on the ballpark for 30 years, a deal that began last year. But Enro=
n is in trouble. It has lost nearly $60 billion in its market value; the com=
pany recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by =
nearly $600 million and it agreed to be acquired by Dynergy for $9 billion.=20
In another part of Houston, the Compaq Center could take on another name now=
 that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 (at $900,000 annually for =
six years) is planning to merge with Hewlett-Packard. In 2003, the Rockets w=
ill move to a new arena.=20
Named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before. A takeover turned Ph=
iladelphia's Comcast Center into the First Union Center. The TWA Dome in St.=
 Louis is now the Dome at America's Center to reflect TWA's purchase by Amer=
ican Airlines. Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo now has HSBC's name.=20
Meanwhile, Pro Player Stadium near Miami is named for a defunct division of =
the bankrupt Fruit of the Loom.=20
Two other N.F.L. stadiums, one being built, the other three years old, are n=
amed for ailing companies. In Foxboro, Mass., CMGI Field is being readied fo=
r play next season by the New England Patriots. In the 12 months ended July =
31, CMGI, an Internet development company, lost $4.4 billion (twice the annu=
al network TV payments to the N.F.L.). CMGI will pay $114 million over 15 ye=
ars for its naming deal -- if it lasts that long.=20
PSInet, an Internet communications services provider that is paying $105.5 m=
illion over 20 years to be the name atop the Baltimore Ravens' stadium, file=
d for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $3.2 b=
illion in the quarter ending March 31.=20
The Conseco Fieldhouse in Indiana, the home of the Pacers, is named for a fi=
nance and insurance company that recently posted a $410 million quarterly lo=
ss.=20
The financial state of some airlines since Sept. 11 may affect some of the a=
renas and stadiums named for them. Besides the dome in St. Louis, six other =
facilities are named for airlines (two for American). Last year, the Canadia=
n Airlines Saddledome, where the Calgary Flames play, changed its name when =
its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by Air Canada. Now it is the Pengr=
owth Saddledome.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
TheStreet.com
11/16/2001 07:22 AM EST
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10004082.html>

1. Fund Companies Gouge Investors
More gouging for clueless investors: Yet another fund company has said it wi=
ll tack a sales charge onto its mutual funds. In December, Credit Suisse War=
burg Pincus Funds will start selling its funds through brokers in a bid to a=
ttract more assets.=20
The decision fits into a lamentable trend among fund companies adding sales =
charges to funds that previously had been sold directly. Others who've done =
it include Scudder, Strong and Invesco.=20
Sure, it's no surprise that fund marketers are out to rack up more sales, an=
d working through brokers is an easy way to do that (especially for funds wi=
th lousy reputations, which are less likely to attract direct investments wi=
thout outside intervention).=20
But that doesn't change the fact that load funds are almost always a rotten =
deal for investors. Legally, funds with loads are allowed to charge up to 8.=
5% of the initial investment in sales fees.=20
In effect, paying a load reduces the size of an initial investment. When you=
 consider the effects of compounding, that lost money could add up to a whop=
ping amount in foregone returns over time. And now more than ever, investors=
 can't afford to give up one iota of potential yields.=20
2. Cipro Is No Savior for Bayer
A coda to the Cipro investment story, which we argued earlier was unconvinci=
ng: Sure enough, a recent earnings report from Bayer (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - new=
s - commentary) , the German chemical conglomerate that produces Cipro, show=
s that the company's other operational screwups more than outweighed the sma=
ll gains it received from sales of the anti-anthrax drug.=20
For its latest quarter, Bayer reported a loss of 183 million euros, compared=
 with a profit of 534 million euros a year ago.=20
The company acknowledged "substantial" extra business from Cipro shipments, =
including the U.S. government's order of 100 million tablets. But it said th=
e additional sales were "nowhere near enough to compensate" for difficulties=
 in other pharmaceutical lines, notably the damaging withdrawal of its chole=
sterol-lowering drug Lipobay/Baycal from the market in August after it was i=
mplicated in a number of deaths.=20
Bayer's stock, which had dropped in the wake of the terrorist attacks, rose =
sharply as anthrax cases hit the news. From its low point on Sept. 21, the s=
tock jumped 37.3% to its peak on Oct. 12. Since then, with anthrax fears aba=
ting and the news of disappointing earnings, the stock has lost 8.3%.=20
3. Ken Lay, Playing It by the Book=20
You almost have to admire the gall of Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) C=
EO Kenneth Lay, who, in exchange for presiding over the company's brisk slid=
e into mayhem, tried to slip out the door with a $60.6 million pay package.=20
He backed off that plan, according to press reports, on news that Enron empl=
oyees were apoplectic about the deal. Some of them may lose their jobs in th=
e merger with Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) , which came about after=
 Enron's stock cratered on revelations about its fly-by-night accounting pra=
ctices.=20
To be sure, Lay's employment agreement had provided for the payout if he lef=
t the company within 60 days of a change in control. We can only assume that=
 at the time it was drawn up, the agreement's authors didn't see the need to=
 mention that he should leave the company in one piece.=20
By the way, lest we convey the impression that Lay has acted cavalierly, he =
says he's put on his thinking cap lately. "As might be expected, this is a v=
ery reflective time for me," he said on a merger-related conference call thi=
s week. We're a little skeptical of that claim, given that he said in the sa=
me call, "We don't have anything to hide. Quite to the contrary, I think we'=
ve been very forthcoming." Enron is currently under investigation by the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission; fleeing investors have bid the stock down a=
bout 90% from its high last fall.=20
4. A Blodget Blunder?
Speaking of folks who lost money for investors, analyst Henry Blodget is tak=
ing part in a buyout at Merrill Lynch, reportedly exiting the firm with a se=
verance package of about $2 million. (Bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha.)=20
Blodget won notoriety for talking up the prospects of many Internet issues t=
hat later went belly-up or were acquired on the cheap, including such resoun=
ding losers as Pets.com, PSINet and uBid.=20
Last summer one irate investor, claiming he'd lost half a million dollars by=
 taking Blodget's advice, extracted $400,000 in compensation from Merrill Ly=
nch.=20
But despite the lousy stock calls, in retrospect Blodget looks pretty smart.=
 He cultivated a momentarily outsized (if short-lived) cult of personality -=
- worth doing once during a lifetime, in our humble opinion -- and secured a=
 tidy payout on the way out the door.=20
We note his exit from the scene not because he was dumb, but because his pas=
sage represents the end of an ignominiously silly era -- one in which ordina=
ry investors tossed money into dubious ideas (like Pets.com), then were ungr=
aceful enough to complain they'd gotten bad advice. There's no question anal=
ysts may have meted out absurdly bullish stock forecasts. The bigger problem=
 is that investors, suckered by the potential of outlandish profits, acted l=
ike they believed them.=20
5. Unflagging American Opportunists
While we salute the unflagging American entrepreneurial spirit, we note that=
 it also can metamorphose into enthusiastic fraud. Such was the case with th=
ree opportunists flagged by the SEC this week: companies claiming to have pr=
oducts that protect against bioterrorism.=20
Most inventive of the three was from R-Tec Technologies (RTTC.OB:OTC BB - ne=
ws - commentary) , which claimed to have developed a "Chemical and Biologica=
l Alarm and Neutralization Defense system," or in trumped-up military lingo,=
 "C-BAND." The company said it's the first "mechanically-operated" (with a w=
ind-up key in back?) system to protect citizens from such attacks.=20
R-Tec has admitted that it's never tested the device, doesn't have any plans=
 to manufacture it and doesn't actually hold a patent on it. But it gets bon=
us fraud points for the cool acronym.=20
More straightforward scams were from Disease Sciences (DISE.OB:OTC BB - news=
 - commentary) and The Classica Group (TCGI:Nasdaq SC - news - commentary) ,=
 which said they had technology capable of killing anthrax in the mail. Dise=
ase Science touted its "High Pressure Pulse" processing, a fairly intensive-=
sounding application that, the SEC notes, it does not have a license to use.=
 The Classica Group's alleged microwave technology likewise got a thumbs-dow=
n from the SEC.=20


GLOBAL INVESTING - Fidelity reveals a rise in its Enron exposure.

Fidelity, the world's largest mutual fund company, boosted its exposure to t=
roubled energy trader Enron by about 20 per cent in the third quarter, just =

In filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission released this week, the=
 Boston-based company reported that it owned 20.8m shares of Enron on Septem=
ber 30 - up from 16.5m on June 30. The group reports its holdings with a two=
-month delay.
The filings do not detail the holdings of individual funds. The group's mana=

Morningstar analyst Scott Cooley noted that even after the increase, assumin=

an $800bn under management, the group holds sizeable positions in many compa=

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - HP and Compaq chiefs to forego $22m - Rev=
elation comes amid shareholder concern over $24bn acquisition.=20
The chief executives of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer will forego more=
 than $22m in retention bonuses to which they would be entitled if the agree=
d merger of their two companies goes ahead.
The revelation, contained in a regulatory filing on Thursday, comes amid wid=
espread shareholder concern about HP's planned acquisition of Compaq for abo=
ut $24bn.=20
The sons of HP's two co-founders have criticised the deal, raising doubts th=
at shareholders would back HP's takeover of its rival. Their opposition has =
prompted speculation that Carly Fiorina, HP's chief executive, would be forc=
ed out if the deal was voted down.=20
She would have been entitled to receive retention bonuses totalling $8m, equ=
al to double the sum of her current salary and target annual bonus. But she =
has declined to accept the right to participate in this programme.=20
Michael Capellas, her counterpart at Compaq, was eligible to receive retenti=
on bonuses totaling $14.4m, equivalent to three times the sum of his current=
 base salary and target annual bonus.=20
Their decisions are shown in a so-called S-4 formal merger prospectus prepar=
ed by HP and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing o=
utlines the managements' arguments for the merger.=20
Despite Ms Fiorina's decision, HP has agreed to a retention payment programm=
e for key executives that could total about $33m if all of them remain emplo=
yed until payment of the second installment of their retention bonuses. In a=
ddition, Ms Fiorina and several other officials are negotiating new contract=
s that would give them higher salaries, the potential for bonuses and stock =
options.=20
The compensation plan could cost as much as $22.4m if all key figures remain=
 with the merged company for a certain period of time.=20
The decision by Ms Fiorina and Mr Capellas comes after Ken Lay, chairman and=
 chief executive of Enron, was prompted by shareholder outcry to announce he=
 would not take the more than $60m he was entitled to after Enron agreed a r=
escue bid by rival energy group Dynegy.=20
The S-4 noted that Walter Hewlett, the lone HP director who has opposed the =
combination, is a member of HP's compensation committee.=20
Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission has asked Hewlett-Packard and Com=
paq to provide them with additional information and other material concernin=
g their proposed merger. While it is a standard regulatory practice, the com=
panies warned that the request under federal law would in effect extend the =
waiting period for completion of the merger until August 30 next year.=20
The S-4 did not provide a date for the shareholder votes required to consumm=
ate the $24bn deal.=20
HP on Wednesday surprised the market by posting fiscal fourth quarter result=
s that far exceeded analysts' expectations.=20

Stock drop cuts Enron retirement package

11/16/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Employees of Portland General Electric are in shock af=
ter watching their retirement savings dry up along with the stock of energy =
giant Enron, PGE's parent company.=20
The sting isn't helped by the fact that the selloff coincided with a lockdow=
n that forced employees to hold the stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.
Stock prices have plummeted more than 70 percent since Oct. 16, when Enron a=
nnounced a $618 million third-quarter loss.=20
The loss stemmed largely from investment write-offs that led to the dismissa=
l of the company's chief financial officer and now are being investigated by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
On Oct. 17, Houston-based Enron "locked down" the 401(k) accounts, meaning e=
mployees were not allowed to sell their Enron stock or make any other change=
s to their plans. The freeze lasted until Wednesday.=20
Peggy Fowler, PGE chief executive officer, said the lockdown was the result =
of a long-planned change in retirement fund managers and acknowledged that "=
the timing couldn't have been worse."=20
For 2,700 PGE employees with Enron 401(k) plans, the slump has decimated the=
ir nest eggs.=20
"We couldn't get out, we just sat there and watched our nest eggs go down to=
 nothing," said Roy Rinard, a PGE lineman from Boring with all of his 401(k)=
 plan in Enron stock. Rinard, 54, said his account has dropped in value from=
 more than $472,000 a year ago to $238,000 at the time of the freeze to abou=
t $70,000 now.=20
"I just feel like I've been stolen from and lied to," said Alan Kaseweter, 4=
3, a PGE service department employee who had almost all of his 401(k) invest=
ed in Enron stock. Kaseweter, of Redlands, said his account has dwindled fro=
m $348,000 a year ago to $115,500 at the time of the freeze to $36,000.=20
Enron and PGE employees must accept Enron stock as the company's matching co=
ntribution to their 401(k) accounts. Only employees over 50 and retirees are=
 allowed to roll it over to another investment.=20
Enron seemed like a good bet. The stock climbed 475 percent between 1995 and=
 Dec. 31, 2000.=20
Enron purchased PGE in 1997, while it was reinventing itself into a cutting-=
edge energy trading company. It took staple products such as natural gas and=
 electricity and attempted to trade them like other commodities.=20
Reports surfaced about partnerships founded by Enron Chief Financial Officer=
 Andrew Fastow. The partnerships borrowed money on Enron's behalf, which all=
owed Enron to keep the debt off its books.=20
Fastow left the company, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ope=
ned an investigation.=20
On Nov. 8, Enron said it was restating earnings for the past five years, in =
effect admitting that it had inflated profits.=20
At the same time, Enron froze employees' 401(k) accounts. Enron decided in J=
uly that it would hire new administrators for the retirement program. The ch=
angeover required about a month.=20
Enron directors and executives dumped stock through much of the past 12 mont=
hs, selling more than $136 million worth in all - a fact prominently mention=
ed in recent shareholder lawsuits against the company.=20
Investors have also filed five lawsuits against Enron's executives and direc=
tors, including former PGE chief executive Kenneth L. Harrison.

India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in Indi=
a's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project =
next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of I=
ndia (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX)
"After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and the=
reafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place," =
Doda said.=20
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in =
Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole =
customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal =
government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company=
 said it was willing to sell its equity at cost.=20
Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, w=
hile U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own =
10% each in DPC.=20
"The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC woul=
d be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian f=
inancial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick reso=
lution of all issues at the earliest," Doda said.=20
Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm Nationa=
l Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equi=
ty in Dabhol.=20
"So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven'=
t sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project," he said.=20

CALGARY -- Six powerhouse U.S. players are joining TransCanada PipeLines Ltd=
=2E and Westcoast Energy Inc. in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bi=
d to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline from Alaska.=20
The partnership, which includes energy services and transportation giants Wi=
lliams Cos., Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp., as well as major utilities El P=
aso Corp., PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy Utilities Ventures,have agreed to wo=
rk together with TransCanada and Westcoast to put a proposal before the Alas=
ka gas producers before the end of the year. The group, which laid out its i=
ntentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, said they belie=
ve a gas pipeline running along the Alaska Highway can be built by 2008.
Murray Birch, senior vice-president of Westcoast, said the partners lend exp=
ertise, deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project, which is estimated to=
 cost well over $10-billion (U.S.).=20
"It's in our best interest to involve them. This project is a large project,=
 and certainly Westcoast and TransCanada would have been stretched to do it =
by ourselves," said Mr. Birch, who is also the co-chief executive officer of=
 Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. a joint venture co-owned by Westcoast and TransCa=
nada. Foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed Alaska Highway =
pipeline.=20
Mr. Birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still t=
o be worked out. Rocco Cianco, a Foothills spokesman, said that is in part b=
ecause some of the companies are in a state of flux. Westcoast is in the pro=
cess of being taken over by Duke, while Houston-based Enron is in the proces=
s of being bought by hometown rival Dynegy Corp.=20
The partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participan=
ts in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970s and shelved =
because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition.=20
Mr. Birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipel=
ine project, of whether the six U.S. companies had any claim on the project =
based on their capital investment in the 1970s project. They withdrew from t=
hat project on the understanding that if it was to restart, they would be ab=
le to recover that initial investment, which some have pegged at up to $4-bi=
llion including interest, he said. In getting back on board, the six compani=
es have agreed to waive that claim, he said.=20
Scott Kent, the Minister of Economic Development for Yukon, a vocal proponen=
t of the proposed pipeline, said the removal of the legal question lifts a h=
uge barrier to the project.=20
"There was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that =
would have significantly hampered" the project, he said. "It's certainly ver=
y good news."=20
Winfried Fruehauf, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Toronto, said th=
e six U.S. companies as well as Westcoast, TransCanada and Foothills are try=
ing to make sure they're first in line to move the gas from burgeoning Alask=
an fields to market.=20
"Everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline, there's so ma=
ny 'me toos' that they just want to position themselves," he said.=20
The market understanding is that the Alaska producers, which include Exxon M=
obil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., BP Amoco PLC and Chevron Corp., will ult=
imately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of suc=
h a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls.=20
Gina Taylor, a spokeswoman for Enron, said the partners got together with an=
 eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the proj=
ect can go ahead.=20
"Marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this," she said.=20
"That's why we put the [memorandum] in place, so we could go out and revisit=
 with the producers."=20
But Curtis Thayer, a spokesman for the Alaska producers, said it is too earl=
y to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline, because his group ha=
s not even decided to proceed with one yet.=20
He noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $100-million study th=
e group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn't pay for itself at curre=
nt commodity prices.=20
However, no decision has been made, he insisted.=20
Some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north =
shore of Alaska and Yukon to gas fields in the Northwest Territories, then d=
own the Mackenzie Valley of the NWT, or a pipeline going over land in Yukon =
to the NWT. There are various backers for each proposal and the Alaskan prod=
ucers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves.=20
Joe Handley, the Minister of Finance for the NWT, said news of the partnersh=
ip is a spur to participants in the proposed Mackenzie Valley pipeline.=20
The territory's government has consistently said an NWT pipeline must be bui=
lt first or risk being derailed by an Alaska pipeline that would flood the m=
arket with product.=20
"If we don't keep on our toes, [an Alaska pipeline] could pass us and leave =
us in the bush," he said.=20
Foothills announced earlier this week that it reached a preliminary agreemen=
t with the Kaska Nation, removing another potential hurdle to the Alaska pip=
eline proposal.

Consortium's return sparks renewed hope in gas pipeline project
By MIKE CHAMBERS

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

JUNEAU (AP) - A natural gas consortium plans to resurrect its proposal to bu=
ild a 1,700-mile gas pipeline through Alaska to the Lower 48, sparking renew=
ed hope in the massive undertaking just as oil companies were doubting its v=
iability.=20
The nine American and Canadian companies announced plans on Thursday to offe=
r to build and maintain the pipeline in an effort to ship 36 trillion cubic =
feet of North Slope natural gas.
The group intends to make a proposal to the three major oil companies by Dec=
ember, a spokesman for the consortium said.=20
"The economic benefits of this multi-billion dollar project would impact mos=
t regions of the U.S. and Canada," said Mike Stewart, co-chief executive off=
icer of Foothills Pipe Lines.=20
Foothills reached the agreement with TransCanada PipeLines, Westcoast Energy=
 and American companies Williams, Duke Energy, El Paso Corp., Enron, PG&E Co=
rp. and Sempra Energy International.=20
The groups comprise the original Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportatio=
n Company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970s.=20
Under the terms of the agreement, the companies plan to dismiss $4 billion i=
n costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have bee=
n charged to developers of the pipeline. The money represents their original=
 investment, with interest.=20
"Their intention is to remove that as an issue," said Foothills spokesman Ro=
cco Ciancio.=20
That was seen as a key roadblock to building an all-Alaska pipeline to the L=
ower 48 by officials with the state, which would own 12.5 percent of any nat=
ural gas pumped out of the North Slope.=20
"Now that that's been resolved, it's time the producers come to the table wi=
th pipeline companies, the State of Alaska and other players to get this pro=
ject underway," said Gov. Tony Knowles.=20
Exxon Mobil, Phillips and BP have spent millions studying the viability of t=
he project and, so far, have determined it is not profitable.=20
Knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to =
build a route that generally follows the trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and the A=
laska Highway to Alberta.=20
It would provide jobs for Alaskans, cheap natural gas to communities and rev=
enues for state services, Knowles said.=20
But Canadian officials have pushed for a Beaufort Sea route that taps into r=
ich reserves stranded in the Mackenzie Delta.=20
The oil companies estimate the Canadian route would cost $15.1 billion compa=
red to the Alaska Highway route, which would cost $17 billion.=20
Ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $9.7 billion to const=
ruct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals.=20
The consortium has held permits to build the all-Alaska route since 1976.=20
"We're estimating it would take a greenfield (start up) project somewhere ne=
ar two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project,"=
 Ciancio said.=20
The consortium's project proposes running a 42-inch pipe from Prudhoe Bay to=
 Alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to Chi=
cago and San Francisco, he said.=20
If agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies, the pipeline could=
 be in operation by 2008, Ciancio said.=20
A spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted=
 the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitab=
le.=20
"We're happy to see efforts being made to support an Alaska pipeline project=
," said Dave MacDowell, spokesman for the oil producer's group. "We're absol=
utely open to folks coming forward with efficient economic projects."

USA: Janus funds dumped EMC in third quarter.
By Christopher Noble

11/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOSTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mutual fund giant Janus Capital Corp. dumped 40 m=
illion shares of data storage leader EMC Corp. in the third quarter, cutting=
 deeply into its stake in the one time high flyer while the company's stock =
plunged 59 percent.=20
According to regulatory filings, Janus, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. en=
ded the third quarter with 6.38 million shares in EMC, down from 46.44 milli=
on at the end of the second quarter.
Janus funds also cut storage software maker Veritas Software Co. , dropping =
nearly eight million shares in the quarter. But Janus added about 570,000 sh=
ares to its holding of Network Appliance , bringing it to 1.97 million share=
s.=20
A spokeswoman for Janus declined to comment on the sale of EMC stock, but th=
e company ran into trouble as revenue shrank due to stiffer competition and =
a steep downturn in corporate spending on information technology.=20
Another big move was the sale of about 43.6 million shares of mobile phone m=
aker Nokia . Janus ended the quarter with 183.2 million shares of Nokia, dow=
n from 226.8 million in the previous quarter, the filing showed.=20
The filing shows more sales of technology companies but does not indicate a =
big move out of the tech sector the way previous quarterly data sometimes ha=
s.=20
For instance, its second-quarter filing showed big moves out of many of the =
biggest names of the Internet revolution, including Cisco Systems , EMC, Ora=
cle Corp and Sun Microsystems , the so-called "four horsemen" of the Web, th=
at helped drive the expansion of the "New Economy."=20
While Janus again cut sharply into its stake in Sun - dropping 14.7 million =
shares - its holdings of Cisco and Oracle were nearly unchanged in the quart=
er, the filing showed.=20
Janus also cut about 12.6 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. . On=
 the other hand, the company added some 13.6 million shares of Microsoft Cor=
p. and boosted its stakes in JDS Uniphase and EBay Inc. .=20
The funds also more than doubled their holdings in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. t=
o 320,691 shares.=20
The filing showed that Janus made almost no change in the third quarter to i=
ts holding of Enron Corp. , the energy trading company whose stock collapsed=
 amid a U.S. regulatory probe. At the end of the quarter, Janus held 41.36 m=
illion shares in Enron.=20
The Janus spokeswoman would not comment on the Enron shares, but said that t=
he filings are dated and don't necessarily reflect current holdings.=20
Shares of Enron plunged in mid-October as investors rebelled over the compan=
y's off-the-balance-sheet deals that are now under investigation.=20
Enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter. The compan=
y agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 =
billion in stock.=20
Janus's stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. more than doubled to 39.8 million shares =
in the quarter.=20
Janus's stock holdings were worth $102.09 billion at the end of the quarter,=
 down from $141.05 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Cash Infusion Little Comfort To Enron Counterparties
By Andrew Dowell

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- One and a half billion dollars doesn't go as far as i=
t used to.=20
Despite a cash injection of that size from Dynegy Inc. (DYN) this week, U.S.=
 energy companies continue to restrict their dealings with Enron Corp. (ENE)=
, traders in the U.S. power and natural gas markets said Wednesday.
Traders said they were doing deals with the Houston-based energy giant when =
necessary, and some reported that activity appears to have picked up. But tr=
aders said they were continuing to limit their exposure and doing business w=
ith other parties if possible until Enron's credit rating improves.=20
"It's a company with one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the grave," s=
aid Ed Kennedy, a Miami-based trader with Pioneer Futures.=20
Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's rate Enron one notch ab=
ove speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade=
, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Enron's ability to do business=
 in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.=20
Tuesday's infusion of cash from Dynegy, which has agreed to buy Enron in a s=
tock-swap currently worth about $10 billion, isn't enough to change the outl=
ook for Enron, said Todd Shipman, a director in the U.S. utilities group at =
S&P.=20
Instead, the firm will be watching to see whether Enron can hold on to its c=
ore business of trading North American gas and power. If it does, S&P may re=
visit Enron's credit-watch status after New Year's with an eye to upgrading =
it to "positive," Shipman said.=20
Circular Reasoning=20

That sets up a staredown of sorts between the ratings agency and the energy =
markets, with each waiting for the other to take the first step.=20
"It always has been a sort of face-off," Shipman said. "For the time being, =
we're standing pat unless the situation at Enron gets significantly worse."=20
Moody's wasn't immediately available for comment.=20
Traders and their companies said consistently that until Enron's credit rati=
ngs improve, they will continue to watch their exposure to Enron carefully, =
with trades limited to short-term deals.=20
Mirant Corp. (MIR) is trading with Enron on "a very limited basis" that won'=
t be broadened until Enron's credit situation improves, spokesman Chuck Grif=
fin said.=20
Aquila Corp. (ILA) CEO Keith Stamm said the company was heartened by Dynegy'=
s injection of cash and was continuing to monitor Enron's condition.=20
"The $1.5 billion has improved their situation with us, and we'll keep watch=
ing the situation," Stamm said.=20
On Monday, Aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to Enron significan=
tly.=20
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said 30-day-moving-average volumes on EnronOnline=
, the Internet-based trading platform on which Enron is the counterparty in =
every deal, have improved to a more typical 5,700 transactions per day with =
a notional value of $2.7 billion.=20
"Volumes have returned to the normal range," he said.=20
Some traders said Enron's short-term business does appear to have picked up =
from earlier this week.=20
Staffing Changes A Concern=20

Enron is the country's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, accoun=
ting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates.=20
Even when companies aren't prohibiting their traders from doing business wit=
h Enron, some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure.=20
One funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at Enron are cont=
ributing to traders' reluctance to do business with the company.=20
"You have headhunters out there," the analyst said. "Why tie yourself down w=
ith a five-year deal with someone who may not be there?"=20
Enron currently employes about 1,500 people in its trading operation, and Dy=
negy employes some 300. The acquisition is expected to produce cuts, but Dyn=
egy hasn't said to what degree.=20
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concer=
ns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left it=
s bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt.=20
Enron's restatement of four and a half years' worth of earnings last Thursda=
y and ratings downgrades Friday led some companies to severely restrict thei=
r business with Enron, even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting =
lower bids to do so.=20
Enron's ability to recover that business is critical to its future, S&P's Sh=
ipman said. A stable trading operation will keep Dynegy interested in the bu=
yout, which is the key to keeping Enron's credit ratings out of junk-bond te=
rritory.=20
"That's the crown jewel, and that's what Enron needs to protect," he said. I=
f counterparties pull back, "then I think we would have a little more cause =
for worry about the Dynegy deal."=20

Dynegy May Want Some Of Enron's Broadband Assets
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) may be planning to unwind its Broadb=
and Services unit, but before it can do so, it may have to gain approval fro=
m its future new owner.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) is just beginning to look at which assets it wants to keep=
 from Enron's non-core businesses.
"What we're saying at this point very, very early on is that we want to look=
 and see if there are pieces of (the optical fiber network) that complement =
our strategy," Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser told Dow Jones Newswires. =
"And we're going to take the opportunity to review that."=20
One thing is clear, though: Enron is leaving the bandwidth market in which t=
he company has been the principal market-maker.=20
"I think we've made it pretty clear what our non-core businesses are," Enron=
 Broadband Services spokeswoman Shelly Mansfield told Dow Jones. "We're goin=
g to be exiting those businesses in an orderly fashion."=20
But Thursday morning Enron bandwidth traders said they haven't been told wha=
t will become of them. Many of them came to the bandwidth desk from the comp=
any's energy trading operations.=20
"I've not been given any definitive information," a trader said.=20
Traders and brokers who are counterparties to Enron said Enron's traders rem=
ain active in the bandwidth market, regularly showing prices for various con=
tracts.=20
Dynegy traders are also present in the market, but not as pervasively as Enr=
on traders have been, said one broker.=20
Dynegy's traders regularly show a high offer price without presenting a bid =
price, a broker said. Usually Dynegy traders will stay with that high offer =
expecting buyers in the market to come to them.=20
Also, the broker said, Dynegy seems most active with contracts on the New Yo=
rk-Miami route.=20
In addition to deciding what to do with Enron's network, Dynegy also faces d=
ecisions about whether to retain Enron's bandwidth traders and the contracts=
 the company still holds for bandwidth services.=20
Guiding Dynegy's decisions will be a continuing commitment to its own bandwi=
dth strategy.=20
"Dynegy has been focused on building very long-term customer relationships,"=
 Rosser said. "We are focused, just as we have been in our energy business, =
on being a value-added provider to our customers. We have maintained a focus=
 on the wholesale market...and large enterprise consumers of bandwidth. We h=
ave maintained focus on structured transactions and not trading, primarily b=
ecause we don't think a true trading environment exists yet."=20
While Enron may attempt to sell its network in the nine to 12 months before =
the merger is completed, it may be unable to do so, brokers of physical asse=
ts and bandwidth said.=20
Most optical networks are being broken up for sale, said physical assets bro=
kers.=20
