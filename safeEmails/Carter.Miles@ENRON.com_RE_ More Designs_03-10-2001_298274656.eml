Thanks Mike.

I will have the designer put the final copy into design six. We do not have =
a sample of the 100# paper that was quoted for the job. However, I could sho=
w you a color laser for you to sign off on if you just wanted to see a print=
ed copy.

Just let me know.

Thanks,
Carter

Carter,

We like design six.  Please put in the text from yesterday.  The color schem=
e is good.  Please make sure Enron Emissions Services is bigger than the sec=
ond title (only by one font size).  Also, can we see it on the 100# paper th=
is afternoon.  Around 3-3:30 this afternoon would be great.

Mike =20

Michael,

Based on what we talked about this morning, we will address the size issue o=
f the heading, "Enron Emissions" compared to the the sub head.=20

Tell me what you think about this new direction and maybe we can go from the=
re. Also, we will wait for the copy to be finalized before proceeding.=20

We are thinking about putting more of the content on the back. Right now the=
y are one sided but are reading kind of copy heavy.

Call me to discuss.=20

Thanks,
Carter Miles
