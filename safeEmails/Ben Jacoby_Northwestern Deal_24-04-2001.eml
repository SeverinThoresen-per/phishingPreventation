Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal=20
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings=20
recognition issue.=20

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed=20
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays=20
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine=20
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the=20
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC=
=20
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice=20
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to=
=20
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwester=
n=20
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests=
=20
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If=20
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a=20
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits.=20

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in=
=20
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between th=
e=20
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract=20
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to=20
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that,=20
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very=20
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement=20
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase=20
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have=20
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform=20
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prio=
r=20
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our=20
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our=20
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are=20
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be=20
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated=20
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is=20
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we=20
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderso=
n=20
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income=
=20
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of th=
e=20
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative t=
o=20
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize an=
y=20
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at=20
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this=20
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying=20
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved=20
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the lette=
r=20
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income=20
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized=20
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or=20
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben
