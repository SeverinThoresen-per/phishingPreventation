CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA.  According to CGAS,=20
we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.  Scott is waiting to=
=20
hear from CGAS.  At this point, we will not release the capacity effective=20
for the 1st.

Tenn -  I do not have the new contract numbers yet.  Per Tenn - Scott will=20
send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to th=
e=20
new ENA contracts.

Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to=20
"temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases.  Since I know=20
Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in=20
case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping".  AND we would not know=
=20
about any problems until the 31st.

Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.  Williams has 15,930=20
dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.  I will release 20,000 dt=
h=20
to ENA.  This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams.
