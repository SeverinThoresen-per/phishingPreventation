Could I get more information on what the point issues are with the Oneok OBA=
's?  Are there certain contracts in question? Does it have to do with crossi=
ng mids, or operators of points, or having receipts and deliveries on the sa=
me OBA? =20

Also, can someone be called in from my group to attend just the portion of t=
he meeting when you discuss the above?  We are all involved in testing for t=
he new CMS/CRS systems and if we are not needed for the entire meeting, it w=
ould help to only attend the portion we are needed.

Let me know

Karen
