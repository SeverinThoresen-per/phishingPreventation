Use $4,800 so there will be no surprises. That includes fixed and variable.=20
The budget has not been approved yet, there could be an increase, but I feel=
 confident with the $4,800 estimate.=20

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips i=
=2Ee. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, opera=
tions etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company pla=
ne usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity l=
evel we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for 2=
002.=20
