Chris,

Thanks for your reply.  I received the ISO requirements and timeline; the
requirements appear to be materially consistent with prior year.  We can set=
 up
a call to discuss the audit as early as next week, as we are in the midst of=
 our
earnings release testing this week.  Would next Thursday morning around 9:00
a.m. (your time) work? Any other time on Thursday would work with our schedu=
les.

Thanks,
Linda
