Dave:

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message=20
correctly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can=20
operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas=20
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our=20
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at=20
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

Ben

FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit o=
n=20
the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission=20
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the "expected range=20
of operating conditions".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would=20
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would=
=20
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 10=
0=20
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately=
=20
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

 Ben/Kay:

 Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI. =20

 I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations=20
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be=20
available.

 Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dav=
e=20
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimu=
m=20
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to=20
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

 Fred
