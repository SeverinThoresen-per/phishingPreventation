I have the final audit report from AA.  It was delivered with the reconcilia=
tion that we requested AA to perform.

If you remember, AA finished their study about the time of the final negotia=
tions with AEP.  After discussions with Brian
the audit was findings were put on hold.

I agree with Ed about AA being caught in the middle.  They were really funct=
ioning as our internal audit staff, plus
trying to stay neutral about their findings.  If Enron is going to audit the=
 last year of service ending April, I would like to
go ahead and notify Reliant/Entex and find another firm to perform the audit=
=2E=20

Let me know the next steps if any.

Thanks

bob

A summary of AA's final audit results was never delivered to me, Brenda and =
Bob (I have added Brenda and Bob to the distribution) were handling the AA a=
udit team and I have never seen a compilation of the items we agreed to in o=
ur last meeting with AA just before the HPL sale negotiations started.  This=
 does not mean Bob or Brenda may not have the information but I have never s=
een it.  (Confidentially, I think AA was struggling with their role in this =
because Entex/Reliant is such a large customer of theirs)  In our last meeti=
ng we agreed to use the audit issues as leverage to clarify the intent of th=
e contract.  Who were the other suppliers, how were they allocated, clear de=
finition of which citygates HPL served off-system and access to balancing in=
formation on a real time basis for planning purposes.  A better understandin=
g of Entex's transportation agreement on Midcon and a more proactive role in=
 the management of the transportation contract  Or, if we could not get some=
 of this information and cooperation, HPL would reduce its role with Entex t=
o deliveries at HPL's sales point (basically out of HPL's asset) into Midcon=
, etc.

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets =
we can consider incremental on other pipelines (currently Entex/Midcon claim=
s some Midcon citygates are outside the 10 bcf commitment and additive to Mi=
dcon's supply contract with Entex (part of HPL's audit issues is that there =
is no definitive agreement on which ones).  Indentification has the affect o=
f determining those Entex markets HPL should spend their capital on because =
theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreement.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and indust=
rial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in price=
 between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly documen=
ted and supported.  HPL is in the unusual position of having its customer (E=
ntex) determine the allocation and whether or not the customer (Entex) has m=
et all its obligations, naturally, the customer rarely falls short of its co=
ntractual requirements with this process.

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their perfor=
mance risk, storage revenue, P/L etc that was at risk during the contract ye=
ar.  Additionally, a new audit period for the last contract year will be at =
the end of this month.  If Enron is going to pursue this, it would be approp=
riate to contact Entex for preperation for an additional audit.  I suggest w=
e avoid the AA conflict (we should have enough work papers etc. to support t=
he effort) and go with one of the other large audit firms who has no allianc=
e to Reliant or Entex.

Team:

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and obligatio=
ns (implied, documented or otherwise) between Entex, ENA and HPL.  We need t=
o pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1.	The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves agai=
nst those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2.	The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the definiti=
ve results of the audit.

Brad/Jim:  can you email the note you gave me today to the above group.

Tom/Ed:  can you pull together a summary of the results of the audit showing=
 what Entex owes HPL and what Entex owes ENA.

Lillian: can you arrange a meeting with the above group to discuss.

Thanks,
Brian
