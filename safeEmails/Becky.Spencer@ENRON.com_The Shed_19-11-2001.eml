I was going to bed the other night when my wife told me that I had left the =
light on in the shed, she could see from the bedroom window. As I looked for=
 myself, I saw that there were people in the shed taking things.=20

I phoned the police, but they told me that no one was in his area to help at=
 this time, but they would send someone over as soon as they be available.=20

I said OK, hung up, and waited one minute, then phoned the police back. "Hel=
lo. I just called you a minute ago because there were people in my shed. Wel=
l, you don't have to worry about them now because I've shot them all."=20

Within five minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area, an Arme=
d Response unit, the works. Of course, they caught the burglars red-handed. =
One of the officers said: "I thought you said that you'd shot them!"=20

I replied with "I thought you said there was nobody available!"=20
