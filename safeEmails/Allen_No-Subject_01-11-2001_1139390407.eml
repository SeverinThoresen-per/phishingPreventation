Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It i=
s clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't und=
erstand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how man=
y shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "T=
he value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the cl=
osing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of =
payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stoc=
k."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers o=
n my account.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
