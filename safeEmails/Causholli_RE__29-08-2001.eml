Addendum to earlier e-mail - in the basic summaries, let's also include the =
financial statistics - market cap, P/E ratio, stock ticker, and stock perfor=
mance.  I did not see this in the recent GP summary.

Thanks.
Rob

Rob,

Methodology

The methodology we have been using to gather information for the Forest Prod=
uct End-User Report consists of the following:

Collecting the following information from the individual product specialists=
:
Industry characteristics
Trends of the market segments
Shipment Information
Ideas on target markets and customers in their product specialties
Issues in their market segments =09

Information from various published reports, including the North American Fac=
tbook,  Jacobs Sirrene, various industry publications, and news sources.

With this information, we are identifying the top 10 producers and consumers=
 in each market segment.  Each company profile consists of the following inf=
ormation: company description, facilities, products, business strategies, sh=
ipments, production, and capacity numbers.  Attached is a matrix outlining t=
he identified companies, progress of report preparation, and the analysts as=
signed to cover each of the companies.  Since these analysts are new to our =
group and require training, some of the initial reports are taking more time=
=2E  As indicated previously, we appreciate any direction from you and your =
staff on establishing priorities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see a d=
raft of the information that we have been gathering.

Thank you,

Stacey
