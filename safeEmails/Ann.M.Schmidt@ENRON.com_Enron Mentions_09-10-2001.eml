Enron Corp., as expected, agreed to sell its Portland General Electric utili=
ty to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for nearly $1.9 billion in cash and stock in=
 a transaction that will unite the largest gas and electric utilities in Ore=
gon.=20
Northwest Natural also is expected to assume $1.1 billion in debt. For Enron=
, the move comes about five years after it bought Portland General as part o=
f a plan to break into the nation's deregulating power markets. Since then, =
Enron has backed away from that strategy, in part because of the California =
energy crisis. Enron agreed to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources,=
 of Reno, Nev., for about $2 billion in 1999, but that transaction fell apar=
t this year.
Meanwhile, little-known Northwest Natural, of Portland, Ore., is betting tha=
t buying Portland General's operations will give it more muscle on its home =
turf. The combined company, with $5 billion in assets, will have more than 1=
=2E25 million electric and gas customers and will own more than 2,000 megawa=
tts of generation, 26,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution li=
nes, as well as 12,000 miles of gas lines. Northwest Natural supplies natura=
l gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and =
Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1=
=2E4 million customers in Oregon.=20
Terms of the transaction call for Enron to receive $1.55 billion in cash, $2=
00 million in Northwest Natural preferred stock, and $50 million in Northwes=
t Natural common stock. Enron has agreed to hold the securities for at least=
 2 1/2 years. The common equity stake will give Enron voting rights amountin=
g to 4.9% of the total number of Northwest Natural shares outstanding. Enron=
, a Houston energy-trading concern, also will receive as many as two seats o=
n Northwest Natural's board, which has 12 members and the authority to boost=
 that number to 13. It isn't clear if Enron would seek two seats.=20
"This sale is consistent with our overall objective of selling assets that a=
re not strategic to our wholesale and retail energy business," said Kenneth =
L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive.=20
The cash portion of the transaction will be raised through loans arranged by=
 Merrill Lynch & Co. , of New York, and Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit o=
f Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group. Enron was advised by Credit Suisse Firs=
t Boston, and Northwest Natural's financial adviser was Merrill Lynch.

Financial Times; Oct 9, 2001
By ANDREW TAYLOR

Brian Wilson, energy minister, yesterday welcomed the decision to restart co=
al production at Hatfield Colliery following the mine's rescue by Richard Bu=
dge, former chief executive of UK Coal. The Coal Authority, responsible for =
licensing mining, formally approved the takeover of Hatfield by Mr Budge's n=
ew company, Coal Power, paving the way for production to restart next month.=
 Mr Budge, who earlier this year was ousted as UK Coal's chief executive, be=
at his former company and Enron, the US energy group, to buy Hatfield for ab=
out Pounds 5m. He was last month named preferred bidder for the colliery whi=
ch went into liquidation in August. The government, in a bid to keep the pit=
 alive, provided Pounds 6.69m of aid.=20
Hatfield is estimated to have coal reserves of 15m-23m tonnes. Recent rises =
in gas prices with more competitive electricity trading have encouraged gene=
rators to switch to more flexible coal-fired plant. Sales of domestically pr=
oduced coal had risen by 20 per cent in each of the past three years, while =
prices paid by power stations had risen from Pounds 22.50 a tonne 18 months =
ago to about Pounds 35, said Mr Budge.=20

Enron seals deal to sell Portland General utility=20

Investors reacted positively to Enron Corp.'s announcement Monday that it se=
aled a deal to sell utility Portland General Electric for almost $1.9 billio=
n.=20
Shares in the Houston-based energy traded finished the day up $1.72 at $33.4=
5.=20
"It's definitely an important catalyst for the stock," said Raymond Niles, a=
n analyst who follows Enron for Salomon Smith Barney.=20
Northwest Natural Gas Co. agreed to buy Portland General from the Houston-ba=
sed energy trader, which has been trying to sell the utility for months.=20
Under the deal, Enron is to receive $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in N=
W Natural preferred stock and $50 million in NW Natural common stock.=20
NW Natural will take over Enron's $75 million balance toward consumer rate c=
uts Enron agreed to when it bought Portland General in 1997.=20
In addition, NW Natural, based in Portland, Ore., will assume about $1.1 bil=
lion in Portland General debt and preferred stock.=20
The common equity stake in NW Natural will give Enron voting rights limited =
to 4.9 percent. Enron, which has agreed to hold its securities in NW Natural=
 for at least 2 1/2 years, also will receive up to two board seats.=20
The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close by the fourt=
h quarter of 2002.=20
It's the second time Enron reached a deal to sell Portland General. Nevada-b=
ased Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy the utility in November 1999.=20
The deal, valued at about $2 billion plus assumption of $1.1 billion debt an=
d preferred stock, was officially called off in April, although it had been =
considered dead months before.=20
Sierra Pacific planned to sell some of its Nevada assets to raise cash for t=
he deal, but Nevada's move to electricity deregulation was delayed and Sierr=
a couldn't carry out the sales.=20
NW Natural is Oregon's largest natural gas utility, with more than 525,000 c=
ustomers in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.=20
Portland General serves more than 730,000 customers and owns 2,015 megawatts=
 of electricity generation.=20
Enron is moving away from owning large physical assets so it can focus on tr=
ading and making markets in a variety of commodities.=20
"This sale is consistent with our overall objective of selling assets that a=
re not strategic to our wholesale and retail energy business," Ken Lay, Enro=
n's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.=20
Enron bought the utility in 1997 in a deal worth $2 billion, plus it assumed=
 $1.1 billion in debt and preferred stock.=20
The NW Natural deal represents "a break-even transaction from a gain-loss st=
andpoint," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said.=20
Enron could use the proceeds to pay down debt, repurchase stock or invest in=
 the company's high-growth businesses, she said.=20
Enron, when the deal gets closer to completion, must assure investors that t=
he money will be invested in a higher-return opportunity to avoid earnings d=
ilution, said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston.=
=20
Investor confidence in Enron suffered after CEO Jeff Skilling, citing person=
al reasons, unexpectedly resigned in August. Even before then, Enron's stock=
 had come under pressure for a variety of reasons.=20
The Portland General deal "should add one notch in management's credibility =
belt," Coale said, adding: "They have several notches to go."=20

SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: As we told you earlier Enron (UR=
L: http://.www.enron.com/) has agreed to sell its Portland General Electric =
unit to Northwest Natural Gas (URL: http://www.gasco.com/) for $1.9 billion.=
 Richard Reiten is chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural Gas. He joins us fr=
om Portland, Oregon to discuss the deal. Welcome and congratulations.=20
RICHARD REITEN, CHMN & CEO, NORTHWEST NAT. GAS: Thank you.
LISOVICZ: Well the investors have spoken and so far it`s negative. Your stoc=
k is down about 40 cents. Why do you think the market`s not thrilled about w=
hat they`ve heard so far?=20
REITEN: Well I don`t think being down 40 cents is really any indication in a=
 market like today. In fact we`ve got a great transaction. Good for us, Nort=
hwest Natural Gas and certainly good for Enron. We`re able to create a five =
billion asset company headquartered here in Oregon. It`s going to have great=
 growth as well as great shareholder value for Northwest National shareholde=
rs. So it`s a combination gas and electric company being created. Really we`=
re very excited about it.=20
LISOVICZ: $1.9 billion in cash and stock. Fair price?=20
REITEN: Yes. Fair for us and fair for Enron. It gives us great cash flow, gr=
eat accretion to our earnings in the first year, a transaction that I think =
really benefits both parties.=20
LISOVICZ: Will it be accretive to the bottom line in the first year?=20
REITEN: Yes it will.=20
LISOVICZ: OK. Tell me what shareholders can expect immediately if anything.=20
REITEN: Well it`ll take a year for regulatory approval, nine to 12 months an=
yway. And then our first year as a combined company will most likely be 2003=
=2E We made it clear to our investors and shareholders that the transaction =
will be accretive in the first year even applying the old accounting rules a=
mortizing good will. Without the good will amortization it`s double digit ac=
cretive. So it`s a very good transaction for us and our shareholders.=20
LISOVICZ: How did gas prices play into this? Did they speed up or did -did t=
hey influence at all how these talks proceeded?=20
REITEN: No they did not. You know gas prices have been declining rather dram=
atically over the last three months from highs over the previous year. But t=
hey`re coming down now and will be more moderate we think out over the next =
year but didn`t play any role in this. We passed through the gas cost withou=
t margin to our customers as most local gas distribution utilities do. They =
will play a real role because we could bring the gas supply asset storage an=
d so on of our company to Portland General Electric`s gas-fired generation. =
So the combination of those assets are really a powerful set.=20
LISOVICZ: What was most attractive about this property?=20
REITEN: Well I think you have a almost total overlap of geography. Eighty pe=
rcent of Portland General Electric`s customers are located inside Northwest =
Natural Gas service territory. Ninety five percent of the assets are all in =
Oregon. We have a small gas distribution property in southwest Washington. B=
ut there`s terrific overlap, a lot of savings for customers as we move forwa=
rd to bring the companies together and certainly the accretion for our share=
holders as well.=20
LISOVICZ: OK. Richard Reiten, the chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural Gas.=
 Congratulations. Thanks for joining us.=20
REITEN: Thank you very much.=20

CHINA: PetroChina to boost gas output in southwest.

10/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BEIJING, Oct 9 (Reuters) - China's oil major PetroChina has made three natur=
al gas discoveries this year in the southwest Sichuan Basin and aims to boos=
t output in the area by 50 percent, company officials said on Tuesday.=20
Natural gas output in the Sichuan Basin was expected to rise to 12 billion c=
ubic metres (bcm) in 2005 from 8.0 bcm in 2000, an official of PetroChina's =
subsidiary, Southwest Oil and Gas Co, said from the Sichuan capital of Cheng=
du.
To fulfil this target, the southwest company would add an annual gas product=
ion capacity of 4.2 bcm over the next four years, which would be focus on th=
e Datianchi and Baimamiao gas fields, the official told Reuters.=20
"The gas recovery rate in Sichuan basin was not very high. We will try hard =
to incease our production capacity in the coming years," he said.=20
The Sichuan Basin is PetroChina's biggest gas producing area.=20
The three discoveries PetroChina made so far this year in Sichuan had a comb=
ined possible gas reserves of 25.2 bcm, another official said.=20
The Nanchong structure in central Sichuan had a gas reserve of 17.8 bcm, the=
 Jinzhuping structure in the east contained 2.88 bcm of reserves and the Lon=
gquan structure in the west had 5.5 bcm, the official said.=20
The three structures cover a total area of 447 square km (172.6 sq miles), h=
e said.=20
Experts have predicted gas reserves in the Sichuan Basin were likely to be o=
ne trillion cubic metres by 2005.=20
PetroChina has also speeded up construction of several natural gas purificat=
ion plants in Sichuan, including one in the Zhongxian county of Chongqing, w=
here a planned gas pipeline to the neighbouring province of Hubei starts, he=
 said.=20
Gas purification capacity in the basin would rise to 9.0 bcm in 2004 from 5.=
5 bcm in 2000.=20
GAS PIPELINES=20
PetroChina is at the preparation stage of the Zhongxian-Hubei pipeline, Chin=
a's first joint venture gas pipeline.=20
The Chinese company holds a 55 percent stake in $400 million project and U.S=
=2E energy firm Enron the remainder.=20
The two companies, which finished a feasibility study and got state approval=
 for building the pipeline last year, were busy doing a market survey, the o=
fficial said.=20
The 680 km (420 mile) pipeline, designed to transfer 3.0 bcm of natural gas =
a year, may be extended to the province of Hunan later, he said.=20
The Southwest Oil and Gas Co is cooperating with French firm Sofregas to upg=
rade more than 1,000 km of gas pipelines in Sichuan.=20
The $230 million upgrade, including repairs, cleaning and extending pipeline=
s, would enable the trunk lines to transfer 8.0 million cubic metres per day=
 upon completion in mid-2003, the official said.
