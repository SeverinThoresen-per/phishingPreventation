Did you ever get home last night? I hope your meeting with Allen was useful.=
 One thing you can be sure about: today will be a better day!

Dick Robinson asked if we could email him Allen's presentation. I suspect mo=
st other people would prefer a printout. Could you send it to Allen by email=
 and have Nyree distribute the others by paper copy?
