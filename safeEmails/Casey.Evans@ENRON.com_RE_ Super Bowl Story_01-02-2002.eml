In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was  busily working when a new voice=
 came over the intercom asking for a carry out at  check register 4. Kurtis =
was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air,  and decided to answe=
r the call. As he approached the check-out stand a  distantsmile caught his =
eye, the new  check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman (maybe 26=
, and he was only  22) and he immediately fell in love.
=20
Later that day, after his shift was over, he  waited by the punch out clock =
to find out her name. She came into the break room  and smiled softly at him=
 and took her card and punched out and left. He looked  at her card - BRENDA=
=2E He walked out only to see her start walking up the  road.
=20
The next day, he waited outside as she left  the supermarket, and offered he=
r a ride home. He looked harmless enough, and she  accepted. When he dropped=
 her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again,  outside of work. She si=
mply said it wasn't possible. He pressed and then she  explained she had two=
 children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter. So he  offered to pay for t=
he baby-sitter. She reluctantly accepted his offer for a  date for the follo=
wing Saturday.
=20
That Saturday night he arrived at her door  only to have her tell him that s=
he was unable to go out with him. The  baby-sitter had called and canceled. =
To which Kurtis simply said, "Well,  lets take the kids with us."
=20
She tried to explain that taking the children  was not an option, but again =
not taking no for an answer, he pressed. Finally  Brenda, brought him inside=
 to meet her children. She had an older daughter who  was very cute, Kurtis =
thought. Then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.  He was born a pa=
raplegic with Down's syndrome. Kurtis asked Brenda, "I  still don't understa=
nd why the kids can't come with us?"
=20
Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away  from a woman with two kids, espe=
cially if one had disabilities. Just like her  first husband and father of t=
he children did.
=20
That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the  kids, went to dinner and the m=
ovies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would  take care of him. When he =
needed to use the restroom, he picked him up out of  his wheel-chair and too=
k him. The kids loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening,  Brenda knew this w=
as the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her  life with.
=20
A year later, they were married and Kurtis  adopted both of her children and=
 since then have added two more children to the  family.
=20
So what happened to the stock boy and the  check out girl? Well, Mr. And Mrs=
=2E Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he  is employed by the St. Lou=
is Rams and plays  quarterback.
