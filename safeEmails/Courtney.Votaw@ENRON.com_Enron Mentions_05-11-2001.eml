USA: UPDATE 1-Fitch cuts ratings on Enron debt.

11/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Fitch on Monday cut its ratings on the debt of e=
mbattled energy trader Enron Corp. and warned that it may cut the ratings ag=
ain if the company does not reduce its debts, if its trading business deteri=
orates or if charges exceed present estimates.=20
"Today's rating action reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its=
 liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence," Fitch=
 said.
Fitch cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "BBB-minus," one no=
tch above junk, from "BBB-plus," its subordinated debt to "BB" from "BBB," a=
nd its commercial paper to "F3" from "F2." The rating agency also downgraded=
 Enron's preferred stock to "B-plus" from "BBB-minus."=20
Fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management pri=
ority, and if Enron is successful, the company's credit profile will improve=
=2E "However, the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution ri=
sk, particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging-market countries," Fi=
tch said.=20
Fitch's cut follows downgrades last week by Moody's Investors Service and St=
andard & Poor's. Enron's shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than =
a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigat=
ion by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
S&P last Thursday cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rat=
ings to "BBB," two notches above junk status, from "BBB-plus." Moody's Inves=
tors Service last Monday cut Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2," two no=
tches above junk, from "Baa1."=20
Downgrades could make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-=
day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral.=20
Enron lined up $1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell=
 assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence, accord=
ing to investment bankers.=20
In its third-quarter results report last month, Enron said it expected over =
a billion dollars of write-offs related to soured investments. It also annou=
nced an extra $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to inves=
tments that were not recorded on its balance sheet.=20
Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006, bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a=
 week ago, were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on Monday, a strategist said.=20
Enron shares were up 40 cents, or 3.55 percent, at $11.67 in midday trade on=
 the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have been in free-fall for two week=
s.

Fitch Downgrades Enron To `BBB-'; Maintains Rtg Watch Negative

11/05/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 5, 2001--Fitch downgrades Enron's outstandin=
g securities as follows: senior unsecured debt to `BBB-' from `BBB+'; subord=
inated debt to `BB` from `BBB'; and preferred stock to `B+' from `BBB-`. Enr=
on's commercial paper has been downgraded to `F3' from `F2'. The senior unse=
cured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries, Northern Natural Gas Co. an=
d Transwestern Pipeline Co., are lowered to `BBB-' from `A-`. All the above =
securities remain on Rating Watch Negative status. Fitch would consider furt=
her downgrades if Enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt, if it=
s wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material de=
terioration, or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non- c=
ore businesses and investments exceed present estimations.=20
Today's rating action reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its =
liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence. This fo=
llows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global mer=
chant investments, which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off-=
balance sheet vehicles. Enron should be able to manage through this challeng=
ing environment, ultimately recognizing the values of the company's core bus=
inesses.
In October, Enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities =
and paid down outstanding commercial paper, leaving it approximately $1 bill=
ion of cash on hand to support normal business activities. In addition, the =
company is in the process of executing a new $1 billion secured bank facilit=
y that pledges the assets of Northern Natural and Transwestern. Unsecured cr=
editors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset =
coverage. While its current cash position appears adequate, securing additio=
nal capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would =
be a favorable development.=20
A management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesse=
s. Clearly, these actions, if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and i=
mprove the company's credit profile. However, the targeted transactions have=
 varying degrees of execution risk, particularly the divestiture of assets i=
n emerging market countries. An additional uncertainty is the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation of certain Enron sponsored partne=
rships. The outcome and potential impact of the SEC activity is difficult to=
 predict.=20
The largest announced transaction is the sale of Portland General Electric C=
o.(PGE) to Northwest Natural Gas Co. The sale appears to be moving ahead as =
planned and has the favorable support of key local interests. However, the t=
ransaction is not expected to close for another year.=20
Enron's core businesses have continued to generate strong, predictable perfo=
rmance and have significant value. Prospectively, operations at Enron's dome=
stic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty=
 at Enron. Also, PGE is expected to generate positive and predictable earnin=
gs and cash flow over the next year. Combined, the pipelines and PGE generat=
e nearly 25% of EBITDA. Wholesale and retail energy services segments have a=
lso consistently reported predictable and growing returns. Specifically, com=
modity marketing and trading activities, which comprise the most profitable =
and largest part of wholesale operations, have generated steady volume growt=
h and stable unit margins. However, if Enron were unable to maintain the sup=
port of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility, th=
ese businesses would be harmed.

NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Stocks are seen climbing at the open of trading =
on Monday, as Wall Street looks for another half-point interest-rate cut on =
Tuesday to help put the lagging economy back on track and boost slumping cor=
porate profits.=20
Equities are getting an additional boost from the Treasury's decision last w=
eek to stop selling 30-year bonds, sending cash flowing out of bonds and int=
o stocks, traders said.
The gain in futures is "the half-point talking," said Brian Finnerty, co-hea=
d of capital markets at C.E. Unterberg Towbin. "The cut continues the aggres=
sive moves on the part of the Fed, and it comes on top of a huge move by the=
 Treasury. The Treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the Fed's =
done all year. "=20
Technology stocks rose in early trading, as investors geared up for Cisco Sy=
stems Inc.'s quarterly results after exchanges close. Analysts said the netw=
orking gear maker is likely to signal lagging sales are near a turnaround.=20
December futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 8 points, or 0.=
7 percent, to 1,097.50, while December futures for the Nasdaq composite inde=
x rose 21 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,454.50. The Indicative Dow Jones inde=
x, which represents a basket of Dow stocks trading in Europe, slipped 2.4 po=
ints, or 0.02 percent.=20
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for a 10th=
 time this year at its meeting on Tuesday, to help jump-start the lagging ec=
onomy. Lower interest rates cut borrowing costs and can spur business develo=
pment.=20
Blue chips rallied on Friday, helping the broader market eke out gains, as i=
nvestors shrugged off a report of the biggest U.S. job losses in more than t=
wo decades in October to bet on an economic recovery next year.=20
"Any kind of bad news hasn't been able to hold the market down," said Bob Ba=
sel, a listed trader with Salomon Smith Barney.=20
Cisco rose to $17.80 on electronic trading system Instinet, up from its clos=
e of $17.26. The company, which makes networking gear that helps power the I=
nternet, is expected to report fiscal first-quarter results after exchanges =
close. Cisco is likely to signal sales are near a rebound, indicating the la=
gging tech industry has reached its low point and will begin to rebound soon=
, analysts and investors said.=20
Microsoft Corp. rose to $61.74 from its Friday close of $61.40. Microsoft an=
d the Justice Department reached a settlement agreement last week. Still, st=
ate antitrust enforcers have found what they say are serious flaws in the se=
ttlement, and the two sides may not be able to sign the deal in its current =
form, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. The =
European Union said on Monday its probe of Microsoft continues despite the s=
ettlement.=20
Enron Corp., the struggling energy giant, rose to $11.80 on Instinet, up fro=
m its close of $11.27 on Friday. Royal Dutch/Shell Group may mount an $11 bi=
llion bid for Enron, the UK's Independent paper reported on Sunday.=20
Enron lined up $1 billion of new credit last week, but it still suffered a s=
econd credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial transacti=
ons that have triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange=
 Commission.=20
Pixar Animation Studios Inc. jumped to $37.25 from a Friday close of $36.70.=
 Pixar and Walt Disney Co. scored a monstrous opening with their latest fami=
ly cartoon "Monsters, Inc.," scaring up $63.5 million in ticket sales in its=
 first three days, according to studio estimates issued on Sunday.=20
Baxter International Inc. fell to $47.60 on Instinet from its close of $49 a=
fter it said preliminary tests show a processing fluid used in its manufactu=
ring operations in Sweden may have played a role in kidney patient deaths li=
nked to dialysis machines.=20
Baxter said it plans to permanently discontinue making the product and warne=
d it will take a fourth-quarter charge to cover costs related to the product=
 cancellation.=20
European markets gained on Monday, led by technology and auto stocks. Solid =
Wall Street futures and the prospect of more interest rate cuts later this w=
eek buoyed sentiment, traders said. Wall Street's resiliency on Friday, when=
 investors looked beyond poor payrolls numbers and bet on a recovery next ye=
ar, also helped steady European nerves.=20
The FTSE Eurotop 300 index was up 1.5 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50 index ro=
se 1.8 percent. Technology and auto stocks were the strongest as players fun=
neled cash back into sectors which fell hard after the Sept. 11 attacks in t=

UK: British power trading slow, prompt lifted early.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - British electricity trading was slow on Monday, wi=
th traders saying prompt prices were ending broadly unchanged after a higher=
 start in part because of a band of colder weather affecting much of the cou=
ntry.=20
"It's a fairly quiet market, still lacking liquidity," said one trader, refe=
rring to the reluctance of some companies to deal with Enron .
In the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commision is investigating substanti=
al losses at Enron relating to a private equity operation run by the group's=
 former chief financial officer.=20
Traders said the prompt market opened strong with day-ahead baseload lifted =
at 20 pounds a megawatt hour.=20
But the early strength evaporated during the day and in late trade the contr=
act was down to about 17 pounds.=20
December baseload gained early support from day-ahead. It was finishing the =
day at about 18.40 pounds from a low of 18.34 pounds.=20
Q101 baseload was seen as high as 19.45 pounds before it fell to 19.30/19.35=
 pounds in the afternoon.=20
Summer 02 baseload was a touch stronger at 17.25 pounds while winter 02 was =
assessed at 19.25 pounds.
