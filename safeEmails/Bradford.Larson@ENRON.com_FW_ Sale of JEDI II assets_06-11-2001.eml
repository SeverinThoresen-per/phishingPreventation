Subject:	RE: Sale of JEDI II assets

John, the prior conversations concerning these assets indicated that the non=
-JEDI 2 ownership of some of these assets resided in the WhiteWing structure=
=2E WhiteWing also involves outside equity, and in addition to other concern=
s, has limitations on sales below contributed value [the book value on the t=
ransfer to WhiteWing]. Given the current situation concerning related party =
transactions, I recommend approval from the Enron Corp. Board prior to any r=
elated party transaction, as well as the approval of JEDI 2 and in the case =
of WhiteWing, at least a majority of the outside equity.

Teresa, if these activities are under active consideration, I suggest we sch=
edule meetings with Mark Haedicke and Jeff McMahon.

John,  It has come to my attention that we are looking at selling several of=
 the E&P investments to a related party.  Because of the current issues Enro=
n is having with related party transactions, such a sale will require Enron =
as GP of JEDI II, to obtain the LPs consent - obviously this mean CalPERS as=
 I am assuming we would consent to our own deal.  I have spoken with CalPERS=
 briefly regarding the proposed sale and they do not seem immediately inclin=
ed to permit such a sale.  Please give me a call so we can discuss.  Thanks.=
