Looks like you are right about CNR Mar-02. You can fix them on the tab label=
ed CNRVol (or call me and I'll come do it real quick).

Processing charges are billed by CGAS and CNR (and Gatherco too).  They woul=
d be processed and paid by Volume Management.  Some of the extra $0.03 charg=
es are billed by Mark West.

I'm working on the volume split files for Dec-01 Dominion. We can match it w=
ith the status/effective date file Robin is fixing.

Call you soon.

Quetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file=
 are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would=
 you check on that please sir?

Thanks.
