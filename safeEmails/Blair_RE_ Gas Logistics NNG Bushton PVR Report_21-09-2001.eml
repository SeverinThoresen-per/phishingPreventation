I finished development of a BusinessObjects Report to produce the NNG Bushto=
n PVR information.  Today I turned this over to the Gas Logistics South End =
Team.  The report is available via the intranet web server Infosource.ets.en=
ron.com.  I walked the team through the login process, refreshed and printed=
 the report.  I plan to demonstrate how this report was built to the Gas Log=
istics report team being coordinated by Mike Bodnar.  I will do so at one of=
 our earliest meetings.  Please let me know if you have questions.
