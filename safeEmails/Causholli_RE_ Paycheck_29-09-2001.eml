The reason why your check went to Portland is because in 2000 the ISC create=
d a US01 address for you so that you would receive your checks while you wer=
e in Portland.  I have gone into SAP and delimited your US01 address and you=
 will receive your 10/15 check at your 2906 mail stop.

My current address is

and I changed this in the ehronline website. Can you reconfirm this?=20

Thanks,
Monika Causholli
