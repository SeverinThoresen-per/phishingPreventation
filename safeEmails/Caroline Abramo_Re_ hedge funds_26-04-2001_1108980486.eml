Your email is the first I've heard of Arthur Amron as legal counsel.  Do you=

have his email address?
Also, who are Marty Lifgren and Charles Davidson at Wexford who received our=
=20
documents?  Are these individuals traders?

I will let you know who my backup will be.

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed=20
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send=
 =20
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the=20
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first=20
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron lega=
l=20
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2=20
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the=20
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls,=20
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
