Kevin:
Sara and I were discussing the additional utility provisions that we=20
typically insert into our ISDA MAster Schedule when we are dealing with a=20
regulated counterparty.  As a general rule, most of these counterparties=20
object to such provisions.  In light of this, we thought that as a compromis=
e=20
we would eliminate the Information Sheet, the "additional reps" and the=20
additional covenants and rely on inserting the following as an Additional=20
Termination Event:

"the filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in an=
y=20
proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other=20
entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respec=
t=20
of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the=20
state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated to the effect that=20
performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or=20
similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more=20
Transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable."


What do you think about this?  Alos, have you had a chance to come up with a=
=20
revised definition for "Affiliate" that we could use in our setoff provision=
s?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol
