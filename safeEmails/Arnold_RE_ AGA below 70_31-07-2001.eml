if the number last week was right, then that looks possible.  however, 2 wee=
ks ago the # came out higher than everybody thought so all the models were j=
acked up.  aga is certainly much better than the api but still cant put too =
much into one number

think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowi=
ng that tropical activity will develop at some point.  however, think the fa=
ilure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people.  think that nobody wants =
to own above 325, only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 5-10=
 cents higher unless aga is very bullish.

I like it. But I am the minority. relative to nat gas I think HO has greter =
propensity to spike. right now I am working on just such analysis -will have=
 details late rthis week.  I will probably spread TZ6 or NYMEX vs HO (going =
long the ho portion). Remember that unlike NG, about 90-92% of HO is made on=
 demand -so stocks are not as important. also I think relative to NG HO sotc=
ks are lower in that we are not headed to all time highs lin ho like we are =
in ng.also EUrope had ver vey warm winter last year. Reversion to norm espec=
ially in early (nov-mar) could keep things tighter if arb opens to EC.
We are beginning to see run cuts. I think OPEC is serious.
what si your view on ng t this week and next?
