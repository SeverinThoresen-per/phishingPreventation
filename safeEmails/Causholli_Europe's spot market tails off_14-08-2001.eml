BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunt=
ing ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom pri=
ces for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sink=
ing below production costs.
North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared =
from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a =
more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already s=
elling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts=
 of the world are coming up against the same predicament.
Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, "doesn't really exist on the spo=
t market any more." There is still some softwood around for those who seek s=
pot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, all=
ied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot de=
als and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be p=
estered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawker=
s of spot tonnes out to do a deal.
What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is p=
riced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equiva=
lent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which Ju=
ne's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some=
 $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the =
Middle East to compete for Government tenders.
The availability of spot tonnes from Scandinavian producers could frustrate =
regular European buyers who need no extra tonnes and would have to break con=
tracts to take advantage of this cheaper surplus.
Reports of much stronger buying activity in Asia also explain a shift in spo=
t pulp supply away from Europe. But this could be tempered marginally by a f=
all in the price of radiata pine pulp supplied to the region by Latin Americ=
an producers.
The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 last week at $407.5 DD=
U net. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a use=
ful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little more down=
ward pressure on spot prices.
Spot prices in Europe during the week ending August 10 were: NBSK $370 - 400=
/tonne, eucalyptus $330 -340/tonne.
