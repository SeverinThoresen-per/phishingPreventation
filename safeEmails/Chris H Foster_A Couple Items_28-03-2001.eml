We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you b=

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the=20

avoid transmission. =20

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  =

remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being =

better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does=20
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity=

contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is=
