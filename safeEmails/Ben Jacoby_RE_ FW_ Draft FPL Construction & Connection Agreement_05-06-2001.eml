In response to the second point below, the substation will be owned by FPL.=20

would like any other legal / commercial comments at your earliest=20

would of course like to incorporate TECO's comments as well.

Ben,

Nester Martinez in our transmission group reviewed Draft FPL Construction &=20
Connection Agreement and below are his comments:

=A3 No major concerns with the project or its interconnection. It appears th=
at=20
this is a basic ring bus design and the 500KV line is adjacent to where the=20
Midway Energy Center substation will be built. Connecting the station will=20
require a number of upgrades on the FPL system and the Dynamic Stability=20
Study indicated no adverse affect to the FPL system.

=A3 The EMPP substation will now be an integral part of the reliability of t=
he=20
500KV- FPL transmission line (since it will be looped through our=20
substation). Does EMPP have liabilities associated with the failure of our=20
equipment that could take the line out of service etc.?  Who will own the=20
substation?


Could you please respond to the second point.  Thanks, Becky

 Ben, I have forwarded the Construction and Connection Agreement
to our transmission interconnect "guy" and he is currently reviewing.
He said he should have comments (if any) by Friday June 1.  I will
forward on his comments as soon as I have them.

 Thanks, Becky
