Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and re=
sponsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great applica=
tion that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing t=
ransaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like=
 to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we=
 mean by "outsourcing" your mid and back office functions to our "ProsessCo/=
ServiceCo."  I think we have identified what types of services we could offe=
r and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk reporting, =
general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, nominations/scheduling, volume m=
anagement and settlements (invoice and cash payments/collections).  We will =
articulate how it works and how it hopefully makes sense for you to let us a=
dd a few more resources to accomodate your growing business instead of you b=
uilding it from scratch. =20

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality=
, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial e=
asier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

Piper


PS  Let's do another dinner with McGowan, etc. soon (or play golf some time =
or catch some beers).
