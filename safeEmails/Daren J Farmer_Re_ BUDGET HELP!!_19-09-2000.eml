Subject: BUDGET HELP!!

SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems. =20
Unfortunately, many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your=20
staff's salary is.  I have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR=20
department to also give me
the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary mos=
t=20
likely are not what
they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using=20
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.

Here's what you can do:

1) Make a list of your staff just their positions.
2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low t=
o=20
average, etc.
 You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that=20
position, etc.
3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget.
4) Here is the average:

 Sr. $4,961
 Spec $3,964
 Staff $3,026
 Sr. Clrk $2,548
 Clerk $2,264
 Asst $3,162

Your list would look something like this:

 Assistant Average
 Clerk  Very High
 Sr. Clerk Low
 Specialist Low to Average
 Specialist Average
 Sr. Specialist Average to High
 Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)

You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.

Next Item - TRAINING!!!

Here's what you can do:

1) List your staff and the type of class they need
2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list wha=
t=20
type
 of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or
 Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip)
3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700
4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000.
5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.

Next Item - Headhunters!

Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.


Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during th=
e=20
year that
people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthd=
ay
ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these=20
items, I will
make sure it is added to your budget.


Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will=20
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully=
=20
this helps you some.
