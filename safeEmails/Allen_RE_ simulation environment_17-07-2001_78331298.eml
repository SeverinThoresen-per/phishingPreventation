Jay,

My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all produ=
cts.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID th=
at can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.

Thank you,
Phillip

Hi Phillip,

simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West po=
wer.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to =
just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.

Thanks!

Hunter,

The simulation url is https://simweb0.eolsim.com

Your accounts are:
	access to all:		simtrader1
	access to us gas only:	simtrader3, simtrader4

Phillip's accounts are:
	access to all:		simtrader2
	access to us gas only:	simtrader5, simtrader6

In each case, the password is the same as the username.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
