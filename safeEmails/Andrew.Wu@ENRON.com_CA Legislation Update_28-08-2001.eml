Subject:	CA Legislation Update

Following is a summary of Jeff Dasovich's latest update on the regulatory fr=
ont:

There is legislation working its way through the CA assembly that, among oth=
er things, would have the following effects:
Suspend Direct Access from 9/1/01 through 12/31/02; new DA rules in effect s=
tarting 1/1/03
Customers who switch to DA between 8/23/01 and 9/1/01 would be responsible f=
or paying their pro rata share of DWR's out of the money forward contracts (=
mechanism and details unclear).  Express purpose for this provision is to pr=
event a "rush" to DA
DA customers may also have to pay for their share of the utilities' 2000 und=
ercollections and surcharges for power they consumed that DWR purchased betw=
een 1/17/01 and the date they switch to DA

Legislation like this could pass next week.  We don't think this changes the=
 way we are currently contracting in CA, but you should be aware this is out=
 there if your are working on a CA contract.  Please let me know if you have=
 any questions.  MDS
