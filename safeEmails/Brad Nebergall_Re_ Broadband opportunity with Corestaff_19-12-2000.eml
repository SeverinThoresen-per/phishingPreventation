Colleen,

Thanks for the heads up on this.  We would be pleased to look into this when=
=20
the time is right from your perspective.   Let us know.   Please follow-up=20
with Mike Rogala or me.

FYI - there were some conversations with ProStaff earlier this year around=20
the same topic and I believe the conclusion was that their bandwidth needs t=
o=20
were too small to be interesting.   I would recommend that we get some sizin=
g=20
info from Corestaff up front so we can determine whether it is worth their=20
time and ours. =20

Thanks again,

Brad

Brad,
As you are aware, Enron has recently signed an agreement with Corestaff for=20
temporary staffing services.  Our group, Global Strategic Sourcing Business=20
Development, is now working with Corestaff from a cross-sell prospective. =20
Corestaff has a contract with MCI for broadband services that will be coming=
=20
up this year for renegotiation.  In the coming month, we would like to=20
facilitate a meeting with the EBS contacts you determine and the Corestaff I=
T=20
contacts.

Nationally, Corestaff has 100 offices and its parent company, The Corporate=20
Services Group, has 348 offices located in Great Britain, France and Spain. =
=20
For your reference, I've also included the original all-Enron e-mail=20
regarding the Corestaff alliance. =20
