Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people se=
verely impacted by the recent flood "Allison".  All business units and Corpo=
rate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the fo=
llowing United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Cen=
ters, and Center for the Retarded.  The Corporate functions and EGAS employe=
es' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming wi=
th the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals=
-on-wheels beneficiaries.  Activities that will be completed that day includ=
e painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.

The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regar=
dless of religious orientation.  These services include: childcare, youth de=
velopment, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elde=
rly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refuge=
e services and other community services.  The Jewish Community Center is res=
ponsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-w=
heels per day.  Funding comes from a combination of federal and state progra=
ms, the United Way and individuals.

I encourage every single employee  to take at least half of your day on Augu=
st 8th to participate in this effort.  RAC's goal is 100% participation.  It=
 is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of =
life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributio=
ns improve the lives of people in our own community. =20

Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping wit=
h this process and can answer any questions.  Please sign up with your team =
leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full=
 day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function'=
s department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsi=
bilities. =20

Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.  Let's show everyone that R=
AC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.
