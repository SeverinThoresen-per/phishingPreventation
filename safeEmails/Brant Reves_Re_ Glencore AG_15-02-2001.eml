Tanya/Sara/Tom:

I spoke with David Porter, the credit person at Glencore Ltd., last Friday=20
and inquired about Glencore AG's relation to Glencore Ltd., with which we=20
have a master swap.  He indicated to me quite emphatically that Glencore=20
Ltd., Glencore AG, and Glencore SA are one in the same.  He explained that=20
when documents of incorporation were filed with the country of Switzerland,=20
this one corporation registered three names which it uses to do business on =
a=20
regional basis.  He faxed over some documents to that effect.  He indicated=20
that while Glencore Ltd., the branch arm doing business here in the states=20
has the master, the master should cover Glencore AG, since it is the same=20
company only the European branch.  He has even offered to work on an=20
amendment to the master to cover the addition of the second name, Glencore=20
AG..

Sara, I will send you the documentation that David Porter faxed me.  Please=20
let me know your opinion of the information contained.

Thanks, Cathy Tudon

We are continuing to send Deemed ISDA's to this entity (periodically) and=20
have transacted with other Glencore entities in the past.   I would like to=20
generate a draft ISDA and send to these guys because it will make our life=20
easier (and we say as much in a Deemed ISDA).  Thanks.  Sara
