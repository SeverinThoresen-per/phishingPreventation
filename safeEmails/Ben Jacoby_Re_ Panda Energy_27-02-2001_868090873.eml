Folks:

I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall dea=
l=20
to him ("Intergen" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a=20
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that=20
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would b=
e=20
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which=20
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is=20
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we=20
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.

I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the=20
transaction as soon as possible.

Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all da=
y=20
today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.

As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the=20
group.

Regards,

Ben
