Margaret,

Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation=20
with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the=20
moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same=20
time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to=20
the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you=
=20
shed some light on this?

Thanx,

Chris Dorland
