Hola senorita,

What's goin on with you? Just trying to get this business cranked up!  Yeah =
I've been busier that an one legged man in an ass kickin' contest!  The week=
end was great, I'm pretty sure that I'll join the Krewe of Gambrinus, after =
Mardi Gras.  What have you been up to?  How was your weekend?  What's goin' =
on this week.  Find a night when I can cook you supper and have some beer & =
cider. I've got my sister's birthday party at Mom & Dad's tonight, but open =
the rest of the week.  Drop me a line when you have a chance.

Take care,

DB
