  Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a=20
   neighboring kingdom.  The monarch could have killed him, but was moved=20
by=20
   Arthur's youthful happiness.=20
   So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult=20
   question.  Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer;  if, after=20
a=20
   year, he still had no  answer, he would be killed.=20
   The question was: "What do women really want?"  Such a question would=20
   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed=20
an=20
   impossible query.  Since it was better than death, however, he accepted=20
the=20
   monarchs proposition to have an answer by year's end.=20
   He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess,=20
the=20
   prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester.  In all, he=20
spoke=20
   with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What=20
most=20
   people did tell him, was to consult the old witch, as only she would=20
know=20
   the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous=20
throughout=20
   the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.=20
   The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to=20
talk=20
   to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept=20
her=20
   price first:  The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of=20
the=20
   Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!=20
   Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had=20
   only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises. He=20
had=20
   never run across such a repugnant creature.  He refused to force his=20
friend=20
   to marry her and have to endure such a burden.=20
   Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.  He told him=20
that=20
   nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the=20
   preservation of the Round  Table.  Hence, their wedding was=20
   proclaimed, and the witch  answered Arthur's question:  "What a woman=20
really=20
   wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life."=20
   Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and=20
that=20
   Arthur's life would be spared.  And so it went.=20
   The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total=20
freedom.=20
 What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief=20
and=20
   anguish.  Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old=20
witch=20
   put her worst manners on display.  She ate with her hands, belched and=20
passed=20
   gas, and made everyone uncomfortable as ever.=20
   The wedding night approached:  Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific=20
   night, entered the bedroom.  What a sight awaited!  The most beautiful=20
woman=20
   he'd ever seen lay before him!  Gawain was astounded and asked what had=20
   happened.  The beauty replied that since he  had been so kind to her=20
(when=20
   she was a witch), half the time she would  be her horrible, deformed=20
self,and=20
   the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self.  Which would he=20
want=20
   her to be during the day and which during the night?=20
   What a cruel question!  Gawain began to think of his predicament:=20
   during the day a beautiful woman to show off to  his friends, but at=20
night,=20
   in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch?  Or would he prefer=20
having=20
   by day  a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful  woman=20
   to enjoy many intimate  moments?=20

 What would you do?=20

   What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read  until you've made your=20
own=20
   choice.=20









   The Answer: * *=20



   Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself.=20

   Upon hearing this, she announced that she would  be beautiful all the=20
time,=20
   because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own=20
life.=20
   What is the moral of this story?=20

   The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly,=20
smart or=20
   dumb. Underneath it all, she's still a witch.=20
