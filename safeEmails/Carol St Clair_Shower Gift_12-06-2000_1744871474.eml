Anne:
I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from=20
Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've=20
narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal=
=20
patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?

Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  =
I=20
am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try t=
o=20
see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.

Carol
