Louise:

I enjoyed our meeting this week on Q1 QBR. If you have any follow up questio=
ns, please let me know.

Brett contacted me today by e-mail with some cost detail on the Ft. Pierce u=
nit. I plan to get back to him on Monday, but wanted to know if you have rea=
ched a decision on how you would like us to proceed with the MHI turbine boo=
k. I did have several follow up conversations with Chris Calger on the topic=
, and he and I are both on board to proceed based on the approach we discuss=
ed in our meeting.

Hope all else is well.

Regards,

Ben
