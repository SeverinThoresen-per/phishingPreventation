Louise,

I only spent an hour on this.  However, I would pass.  This would keep a lot=
 of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and =
then work off the pieces. =20

This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to b=
e good developers, acquirers, etc.  They even say that they that restructure=
d 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense -=
 further reduces our restructuring proposition. =20

To me, the QF optionality goes like this: =20
- If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, =
the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market i=
s low. =20
- If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion.

Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas=
) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me
=2E..and we are bearish on development

At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superio=
r to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international business=
es, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.  Besides, I thin=
k someone will pay more for it.  Over half the net MW is new 7FA capacity - =
attractive to Calpine and the Calpine wanabees.   This is actually a cheap w=
ay for an IPP to hit its MW growth targets without blowing their brains out =
in the spot market. =20

Someone should pay up - not us.  =20

Question: Did we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success o=
f East Coast Power?  Was that success largely driven by the fact that we bou=
ght it cheap?  Or did we innovatively restructure the PPA?  If we brought in=
novative financing to the deal, isn't that the same as buying it cheap?  Was=
 East Coast Power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deal?=20

I can dig into this some more if you'd like.  Our internal model would be my=
 next step.  Let me know.

Regards,

Chris Calger
