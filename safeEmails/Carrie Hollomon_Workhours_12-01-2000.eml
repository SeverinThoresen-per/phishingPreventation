Hello!

As we enter the new year, I think we should all be reminded of Enron's work=20
hour policies and the environment in which we operate.

Enron supports and encourages flexible work hours (7:30-4:30, 8:00-5:00,=20
8:30-5:30, part-time, etc.).  Additionally, the policies allow us generous=20
personal time, family time, sick leave, vacation time, etc.  We are supporte=
d=20
and encouraged to put our health and families first.=20

This culture allow us many freedoms, and it does not dictate a=20
"clock-watcher" mentality.  However, we are all paid to give Enron a minimum=
=20
of a 40 hour work week (or some other agreed upon part-time amount).  This 4=
0=20
hours does not include your lunch hour. =20

As you are all aware, many of our fellow co-workers on the 30th floor are=20
required to give much more than 40 hours a week.  Please do not abuse the=20
privileges we are afforded, and do not tarnish the reputation of our group.

Thanks for all of your hard work and cooperation. . .
Carrie
