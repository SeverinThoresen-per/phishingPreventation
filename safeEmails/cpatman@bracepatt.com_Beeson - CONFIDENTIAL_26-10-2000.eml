I am faxing you separately three pages from Don Ray George, reflecting=20
calculations that I asked him to do concerning each individual plaintiff's=20
damages shown by the Rhodes study.  Specifically, Don Ray, with Marianne's=20
help:  (i) tried to determine the specific wells in which each individual=20
plaintiff had an interest; (ii) located, from Rhodes' study, the 2-page=20
sheets for each of those wells; (iii) added up all the over- and undertake=20
"values" (dollar amounts) shown for that well in the Rhodes study; and (iv)=20
applied plaintiffs' percentage interest to that amount.  He then added up th=
e=20
individual well amounts for each plaintiff, to arrive at that plaintiff's=20
"actual damages per Rhodes."

The purpose of this exercise was to make a rough cut determination as to=20
which plaintiffs will be claiming the most damages, and therefore, to help u=
s=20
decide which method of choosing ten representative plaintiffs would most=20
benefit us.

In doing so, we gave plaintiffs the benefit of the Rhodes Study's=20
methodology, with two exceptions:  (1)  for a given plaintiff, Rhodes added=20
up only the undertaken "values," disregarding entirely and thus failing to=20
offset overtaken "values;" in the scenarios on p. 1 and p. 2, we credited a=20
given plaintiff's overtaken values against that plaintiff's undertaken=20
amount;  (2)  Rhodes also added an "interest" calculation" to his numbers; w=
e=20
did not use his interest calculations at all, because they are totally wrong=
=20
under the law.

But of course, Rhodes' methodology is totally flawed in numerous other=20
respects as well -- so much so, in our opinion, that it is utterly defective=
=20
-- and furthermore, plaintiffs have now indicated they want to rerun numbers=
=20
using different (Intratex) data.  This is just our best effort to get our=20
arms around some numbers at this stage based on plaintiffs' theories, with n=
o=20
consideration of most of our defenses as to each individual plaintiff and to=
=20
all plaintiffs in general.

Page 1 shows the results for each individual plaintiff, crediting overtakes=20
against undertakes.  DISREGARD the $27 million total; that is the total only=
=20
if net overtakes from all of the overtaken plaintiffs combined are credited=20
against net undertakes from all of the undertaken plaintiffs combined.  At=20
least as of this stage, since we are not seeking contribution from overtaken=
=20
plaintiffs, that number is not valid even under our current theories.  (It=20
may become valid at some point, but for now, let's disregard it entirely).

Page 2 shows the cumulative total for all plaintiffs with damages, when=20
offsets are not considered.  The total is: $50,528,850.

Page 3 shows the cumulative total for all plaintiffs, when overtake values=20
are NOT taken into account.  The total is: $66,402,761.

A few observations about these numbers:

1.  First, many plaintiffs -- approximately half -- have no damages at all=20
under the Rhodes methodology, when undertaken values are taken into account.

2.  If my hurried calculations are right, of the $50 million shown on page 2=
,=20
$45 million represents the damages of only 8 plaintiffs (nos. 1-8).

3.  There are significant individualized defenses with respect to these=20
plaintiffs.  It appears at this stage that Southwest Royalties is another=20
Beeson -- i.e., that it acquired its interests in the wells after the 1978-8=
8=20
time period at issue.  We do not yet know that SW Royalties acquired the=20
right to sue on the contracts.  With respect to Eclipse (Beeson's company),=20
we're pretty sure it did not.  American Trading and Production (ATAPCO) had=20
Panhandle gas, and litigated its "fraud" claim re: Panhandle; thus, all=20
damages as of the time of the Panhandle agreements (1985) are plainly=20
barred.  Almost all of Staley's damages would be foreclosed by a settlement=20
he entered into in 1987 (I think that's the date).  We know Joe O'Neill=20
deliberately underproduced a lot of the time.  Those are just a few examples=
=20
from my memory, all of which underscore that these numbers are inflated.

4.  Of course, at trial -- since the court has not certified, and they are=20
entitled to prove up individualized types of damages -- plaintiffs could try=
=20
for damages over and above those shown by the Rhodes study, such as=20
"reservoir damages" for certain individual plaintiffs, etc.  So these are no=
t=20
a ceiling, necessarily.

5.  Again, using the Rhodes study as a basis is very iffy to begin with,=20
since plaintiffs have indicated they're going to redo their ratability=20
analysis using Intratex numbers -- which may yield entirely different result=
s=20
-- and the Rhodes study's methodology is utterly wrong.  But at least it=20
gives us a rough basis with which to work at this stage of the game.
