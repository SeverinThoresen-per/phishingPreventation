Joe - per our discussion on Friday, any assistance you can give Mark and I i=
n selling February TW (West Tx Pool) gas would be appreciated. We can sell m=
ore term if need be.  I will forward you, under separate email, the details.=
  Mark will provide the exact volume prior to the end of day.  I've already =
talked to Allegany Supply Development and Cook Inlet.  Neither has shown muc=
h interest.  Mark sold January's balance to Sid Richardson.  Below is a list=
 of other potential parties that may have interest in the gas (including the=
 contact for Sid Richardson).

Thanks
