With regard to the plan - I'm now waiting for the other shoe to drop (the pl=
an number).

I was referring to all cost centers excluding HPL.

Regulatory does not need to  be covered by you.

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we =
reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows th=
e positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to =
eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.
