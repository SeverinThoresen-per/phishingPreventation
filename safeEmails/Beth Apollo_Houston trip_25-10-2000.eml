Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very=20
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is=
=20
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects=20
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally=20
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is=20
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing=20
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come=20
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your=
=20
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as yo=
u=20
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in=20
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to=20
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE=20
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time wit=
h=20
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth
