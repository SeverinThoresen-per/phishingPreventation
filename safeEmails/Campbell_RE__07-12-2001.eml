David, I got hte same message from Don.  I found out he became a believer ab=
out a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Ch=
rist with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved =
his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the=
 prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens=
 happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit wit=
hin me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when =
I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus =
and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the t=
roops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focuse=
d also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.    =20

It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a =
business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbag=
e going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is=
 rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right=
 now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had=
 retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the diffe=
rent companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink =
slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but the=
n maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people t=
o understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  =
I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 pass=
ages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a pray=
er for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost every=
thing. =20

Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do yo=
u have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....  =20

Larry,

I'm sure things are nuts around there but when you can, let me know how you
are doing.  I heard from Don Stevens that he had been severed but that he
thought all the pipeline folks were spared.  You and your family are in our
prayers.

David
