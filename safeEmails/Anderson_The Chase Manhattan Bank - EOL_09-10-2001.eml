Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for=
 an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has =
spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their c=
onfirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confi=
rming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Pa=
rty for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I=
 thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to exe=
cute the EOL Amendment. =20

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane
