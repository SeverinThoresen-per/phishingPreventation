The Amerex letter looks fine.

FYI, Mark Taylor has been working on the broker access project.  I think tha=
t=20
the structure of these deals may ultimately differ from the structure=20
described in the LOI and term sheet, but I'm not sure what the current=20
thinking is on the structure right now.  I do know that some more thought ha=
s=20
been put into the broker access concept since we developed the Natsource LOI=
=20
(upon which the other two were based), and that we have never gone back to=20
the Natsource LOI to make sure that it represented "the deal."

The LOIs/Term sheets on these deals are non-binding, so I don't think there=20
is any material legal exposure for sending them out and starting discussions=
=20
with these counterparties.  However, I think that when Mark Taylor returns,=20
we need to put our heads together and make sure that these proposals match u=
p=20
with how we our current thinking on these structures.  If there is a big=20
difference, we can talk about approaching our counterparties on these LOIs=20
and explaining our new approach.=20
