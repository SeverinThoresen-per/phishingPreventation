Russ -
I spoke with Dave Bizer a few minutes ago, and he said that you guys were st=
ill going to send the shares to us today even though nothing will happen wit=
h the fee and the note until Friday.  I understand from Tim that he and Skip=
 agreed that you guys would keep the shares, and we'd deal with everything o=
n Friday.  So, why don't you guys just hold on to the shares, and we will se=
ttle the entire trade all at once on Friday.  I think that would be the easi=
est and cleanest way to deal with this.  Talk to you soon.
