I met this morning with three officials from the US Consulate: Mitchell=20
Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade=20
Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade=20
Specialist).                                     They expressed the view=20
that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring=
=20
in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications=20
coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision=20
to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two=20
interests they identified were those of Enron and=20
Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether=20
there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our=20
interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of=20
proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only=
=20
such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot =20
market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this Novembe=
r=20
and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour=
=20
of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to th=
e=20
distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening=
;=20
likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and=20
proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG'=
s=20
announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could=20
be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism=20
pending full retail access.                                              I=20
explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO=20
tariff's "reciprocity" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances=
=20
in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and=20
agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with th=
e=20
gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale=20
market opens this year.                                 I have committed to=20
outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and=20
providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be=20
consistent with the "four guiding principles" enunciated by the Premier and=20
Minister of Energy:  "protecting consumers and offering choice", creating a=20
strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity", "protecting=20
the environment", and "encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting=
=20
the search for alternative sources of=20
power".                                                                     =

 =20
     We are meeting again on Thursday to discuss with the Consul General=20
"Poncho" Huddle.   They are prepared to: a) get it included in Governor=20
Pataki's  statements when he meets with Harris at a NY/Ontario  economic=20
summit in Niagara Falls/Buffalo in late June, b) have the  new Ambassador=20
include it in an early speech in Toronto, and speak to the Premier and=20
others, and c) press the issue with their own contacts in Energy and Finance=
=20
in=20
Ontario.                                                                    =

=20
me a call if you have any questions.  I will develop the model with input=20
from Paul and Garrett and Seabron Adamson/Kevin Wellenius.              =20
