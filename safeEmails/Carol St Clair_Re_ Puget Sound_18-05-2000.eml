Joe:
I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use=
=20
the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. =
=20
Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?

Carol,

We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should=
=20
this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index=20
traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking=20
with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads=
=20
is the one we should confirm the deal under.

thanks,
Joe
