FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about South=
ern Company.
=20
It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The artic=
le discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as e=
vidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were d=
one by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under=
 the relevant legal standards. =20
=20
I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that=
 do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data them=
selves.  I would like to talk about how to manage that.  Let me know who you=
 think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.

Thanks.
