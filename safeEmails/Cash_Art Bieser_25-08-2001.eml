Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser's attorney.  He basically wants a=
 year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).=
  I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand. =
 Let me know if you want to know the details.=20

I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, whic=
h we will run by you before responding to the demand.

In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.

Michelle
