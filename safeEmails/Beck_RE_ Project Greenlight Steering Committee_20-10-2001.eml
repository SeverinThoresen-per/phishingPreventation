ALL-

You will all be getting an invitation to a project greentlight meeting.  I w=
ould like to get together and discuss the logistics of what the committee wi=
ll do.  Please think about:

1.  How often we should meet
2.  How to hold people accountable for projects
3.  Setting up timelines for where the committee thinks we should be at benc=
hmark times.  (maybe each quarter end)
4.  Reporting progress to Sally and Rick Buy

I am sure there are many other things which I have left out, which you guys =
may want to add.  I appreciate everyone' s attention to this project both no=
w and going forward.

Thanks,

Jeff
