All projects are owned in a TRS/FOE structure (Total Return Swap / Friend of=
 Enron) as a result of our continued ownership in Portland General.

The two current East project companies are Motown and Cornhusker.

Motown consists of two 50% interests and has TRS of about $56 million and is=
 on the balance sheet for about $2 million:

Michigan Power - 129 MW power plant fully contracted for power 20+ years and=
 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas.  The PPA is deep in the money versus =
cost to generate (even after the swapped gas in 2015).  Dynegy operates and =
is Managing General Partner ("MGP") and Operator.  Fair performance record o=
n both at best.  Michigan is currently entering into QF stranded cost filing=
s and the time is near to propose a restructuring.  We have waited for about=
 9 months as Doug Clifford (the origination on the purchase) had been attemp=
ting to purchase Dynegy's interest (they have too high a book value and are =
accrual based).

The proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in retur=
n for an option to provide power from the market.  This approach gives Consu=
mer's (a BBB credit) much needed cash at a time when they are significantly =
underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates. Con=
sumer's ( like many other utilities) has a hard time seeing their exposure (=
purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term) and doesn't see any =
regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost filings.

The amended PPA is a non-unit contingent power short which we fill long-term=
 with a contract from the power desk.  The desk takes the obligation because=
 Generation Investments provides a full backstop pricing through their owner=
ship of the plant and the swapped gas (we either float past the swapped gas =
or contract for differences those years with the gas desk).  The PPA and des=
k contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the PPA at=
 1.05 DSCR and about 75 bps over Consumer's current corporate bonds.  The pl=
ant essentially becomes a $0 NPV machine and the power desk has significant =
optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20+ years.  Du=
ring the term of the swapped gas, when the plant isn't called by the desk we=
 can sell the gas into the market for a profit.

It is fairly easy to see the increased value.  The project is currently proj=
ect financed at about 1.5 DSCR for about 14 years (lots of cash).  The desk =
has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the plant.=
  The plant gains efficiency due to revised O&M, insurance, reserves, etc. w=
hich are no longer required due to the removal of project financing.

Difficulties - Dynegy and Consumers.  Consumers can be rational.  Dynegy eit=
her must sell or play along.  Current operational/project management issues =
which Dynegy caused may make their interest available.

Ada - 29 MW plant fully contracted for power 20+ years.  Enron is the MGP.  =
GE operates for us.  50% owned by ConEd.  Fixed gas through 2008.  We would =
propose a restructuring at the same time as Michigan Power (this would leave=
 Consumers with only one unrestructured PPA).  Currently revisiting buying C=
omEd's interest.

Cornhusker -  TRS of about $206 and about $24 on balance sheet.  A 100% inte=
rest in a single 250 MW plant in Texas.  Small Coop which is very litigious.=
  Plant has had some rather spectacular failures (I have pictures which make=
 the engineers on our floor shudder which I would be glad to pass along) but=
 the PPA only requires 60% availability before significantly in the money ca=
pacity payments are reduced (essentially an impossible to reach loss).  The =
failures have been equipmentmanufacturer related (Westinghouse 501F).  Carl =
Tricoli spent the first 7 months (upto February) trying to sell the project =
to the Coop.  We spent last month determining that the Coop will never buy t=
he project (they just don't have the $ and we are a very expensive lender.  =
We're taking a last stab at a restructuring proposal in the coming month and=
 upon appraisal of the Coop's intentions, we'll potentially enter the sell m=
ode.  El Paso has indicated an interest in the project already as the ex-Cit=
izen's employee's over there attempted to restructure some time ago.  If we =
sell the closing should be by 9/30/01.

Again, I apologize for the delay in getting you this info.  Call with questi=
ons.
