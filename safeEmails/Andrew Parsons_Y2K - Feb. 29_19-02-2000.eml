We are approaching February 29, 2000, which is generally regarded as the=20
second most critical Year 2000 rollover date, second only to the millennium=20
rollover.  A year divisible by 100 is not a leap year, unless it is divisibl=
e=20
by 400.  As a consequence, some applications that were programmed incorrectl=
y=20
will believe the date is March 1, which may cause system errors.

During the millennium rollover Enron encountered Y2K related issues only wit=
h=20
the bottom tier of applications and embedded systems that were ranked as=20
"ordinary" or "low" in our triage processes.  The problems that did arise=20
were few and were quickly fixed.  This is exactly what we were planning for=20
and is a testament to a job done exceptionally well by all. =20

In consideration of the few and minor problems Enron encountered on January=20
1, 2000, our procedures for the 29th will be curtailed.  The goals for this=20
period are to validate that all mission critical applications and embedded=20
systems are functioning normally and to ensure that all problems are reporte=
d=20
through the project office.  We are not planning to reopen the Millennium=20
Management Center nor do we plan to operate outside of normal business hours=
=2E

Please ensure that each group that reported to you for the millennium=20
rollover run through the same Y2K checklists for critical systems.  For this=
=20
exercise, however, we anticipate them reporting back to you on an exception=20
basis only.

If problems do occur, the nature, details and planned ready dates should be=20
forwarded to Andrew Parsons (713 853-6665) or Bob Johansen (713 853-6842),=20
who will report to management and monitor events.  Also, be sure to route an=
y=20
inquiries from the press through the same public relations contacts that wer=
e=20
used on January 1st.  The key contact at Corp Public Relations is Karen Denn=
e=20
(713 853-9757).

Thank you for your cooperation,
