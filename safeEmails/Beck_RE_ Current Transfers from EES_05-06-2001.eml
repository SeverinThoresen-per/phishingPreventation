We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management =
of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dav=
e Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the=
 details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the=
 settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (=
Evan Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --Sally=20

Subject:	Current Transfers from EES

Attached is the final list of employees currently identified to be transferr=
ed to EWS and ENW from EES.  These transfers should be made effective July 1=
, 2001to effect a clean cut-off for accounting purposes.  I am sending these=
 today to give you as much lead time as possible, but please do not make the=
m effective any sooner.

Could each cost center lead please keep up with who is on their list today a=
nd, if employees are hired or terminated between now and July 1, 2001, make =
the appropriate adjustment with your respective HR representative to make su=
re they are transferred properly.

Rachel M., can you use this data to pull together a Q3 and Q4 plan for each =
cost center (working with the leads of each area).

Thanks

Wade
