Gerry,=20
This past weekend, specfically September 3rd,  storage injections during the=
 ID2 process were allocated by approximately 130,000 MMBtu. The net storage =
injections at the end of the allocation was approximately 600,000 MMBtu. How=
ever, during the confirmation process certain deliveries, sourced with PNR w=
ithdrawals, were not confirmed by the downstream parties. The confirmation p=
rocess resulted in cuts to PNR withdrawals that allowed net storage injectio=
ns to be scheduled in excess of the 600,000 MMBtu capacity. The pipeline was=
 able to absorb the extra gas this weekend but in the future NNG may not be =
as fortunate.=20

Is there some way for the system to send out a notice whenever, after all th=
e dust settles and the entire cycle is completed, the net scheduled storage =
activity exceeds storage capacity by a significant quantity?=20

When you get a minute ...lets discuss.  =20
