Chris - We now have a volume problem involving  Phillips Production supply=20
and  Power Gas Marketing supply and the Clinton sales.   How do we=20
reconcile?  Phillips and Power Gas Marketing are supplying statements to bac=
k=20
their numbers, and per John Singer, we are trying to use them.  This new=20
change in volumes will result in supply drafts for the differences.

We really need a solution and a resolution.  Please reply.
