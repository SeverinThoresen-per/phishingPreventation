Jackie,=20

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add=20
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter wa=
s=20
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in=20
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.  =20

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and=20
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where=
=20
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was=20
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error=20
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is=20
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day=20
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th). =20

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated=
=20
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to b=
e=20
added to the deal.
