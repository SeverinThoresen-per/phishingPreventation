Betty,

	Stewart has asked that I send you an e-mail giving you the logic behind  th=
e way in which EPMI arrived at the CDWR payments for December as they relate=
 to the PX index.  EPMI made a payment for December sales to all of our Sche=
duling Coordinator clients equal to approximately 78% of what they would hav=
e received according to the PX hourly index.  This is the approximate method=
ology that the  PX  used in making its payments to their customers. If you h=
ave any questions in regards to this issue, feel free to call me at 503-464-=
8219.
