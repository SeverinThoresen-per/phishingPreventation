Dear Richard,

Thanks for speaking with me the other day regarding KWI.  I am writing
to update you on the progress of this search.  Our client is in the final
stages of negotiations with an excellent candidate.   Thanks a lot for
your suggestions and input.  I look forward to working with you in the
future.

Get back to me if you have any questions.

Thanks
