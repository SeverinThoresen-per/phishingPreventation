	Steve and Shelley, I thought you both would be interested in seeing the att=

Below are the talking points that I'd propose we run by Stan and then have S=
tan use with John Gibson and Dave use with Terry Spencer.  Once everyone is =
OK with these, I'll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our=
 recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winsto=
n that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement. =20

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City meas=
urement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of=
 measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation =
between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That str=
ucture is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agre=
ement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers fr=
om Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the=
 very narrow circumstance of a "BTU measurement error".

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEO=
K's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and pr=
ocesses within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AG=
A quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and C=
lick, confirmed this fact during the arbitration.=20

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine w=
hether to call a "special test" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic met=
ers pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon c=
alling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the=
 ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of th=
e meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any tim=
e if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to tr=
ack the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurem=
ent and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications =
and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specificat=
ions.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, =
based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plan=
t, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective =
of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a spe=
cial test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the mete=
red data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to =
that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.=
