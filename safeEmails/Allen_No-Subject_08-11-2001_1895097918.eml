I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimit=
z post office.  The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let m=
e know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & wal=
zem had both sold.  Let me know what you think of this property.  Also, let =
me know of any other ideas about replacement property.
