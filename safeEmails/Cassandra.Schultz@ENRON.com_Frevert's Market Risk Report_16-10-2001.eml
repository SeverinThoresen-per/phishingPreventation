I left a voice mail for David since he's out, but I have a suggestion on our=
 reporting for this meeting (not that I'm reporting anymore...).  I wasn't i=
ncluded in the discussions on how this report started up again, so I may not=
 have all the facts on why we're doing what we're doing.

- at a minimum, we should use the Commodity DPR instead of the Business Unit=
 DPR - for example, he was unable to see the 850 Bcf
	NA Gas NOP, or the components thereof as the Business Unit DPR is used

- would it be worthwhile to do a report that shows a week on week comparisio=
n of NOP, M/G, and VaR, with a 5-day P/L, based on the 	Concentration Limit =
DPR?  It seems to me that is what he's looking for - what happened this past=
 week, and why, not just what our=20
	current position is.  This type of report is also consistent with how Credi=
t presents their information (week on week change).

Let me know if you agree, and maybe Veronica can have that ready for you nex=
t week.


Regards,

Cassandra.
