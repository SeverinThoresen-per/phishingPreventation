That's fine....as long as we can pull the info on the desk level.  Also, we =
will need to move this report to the Report Launcher within Enpower (i.e. ge=
t it out of the Port Calc screen) because we will need to grant access to it=
 to individuals in Accounting and we don't want to give them access to Port =
Calc.  Ideally, we would like to have a screen similar to other reports in t=
he report launcher (i.e. pcs) that would allow us to choose a portfolio, the=
n choose certain or all desks within that portfolio, then choose whether we =
would like the info on a summary level (i.e. total liabilities and total ass=
ets) or a detail level (i.e. liabilities and assets on an individual deal ba=
sis within the desk selected).  Make sense?!

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll call and check messages so if t=
his is unclear, you can just leave me a voice mail.  Otherwise, I'll be back=
 in the office on Thursday.

Thanks!

Dear Casey,

	In order to run MTM Detail report by Desk, a Post ID is still needed. Is th=
at acceptable? You will first choose a Post ID, and then select the desks wi=
thin that Post ID.

	Would you want multiple Post IDs at once, too?

	Thanks,


Norman.
