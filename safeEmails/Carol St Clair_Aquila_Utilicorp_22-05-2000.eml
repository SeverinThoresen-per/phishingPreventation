Susan:
I spoke with Utilicorp's contract person today and we have decided to do the=
=20
following:

1. Leave the ISDA dated May 3, 2000
2. Change the Assignment Effective Date in the Transfer Agreement to whateve=
r=20
date we agree upon with Utilicorp.

Apparently, the ISDA has not been signed yet but will be by them in the next=
=20
few days.  Until Russell comes back, they cannot sign the Transfer=20
Agreement.  Could you please do the following this week:

1. Have the enclosed new form of Transfer Agreement signed and sent to=20
Russell.  Leave the date on Page 1 blank.
2. Send to Russell the additional certificate that he is requesting attachin=
g=20
ENA's resolutions.
Thanks.



Brant:
How much lead time to we need to make the switch online?  Does Utilicorp hav=
e=20
a password?  I'm hopeful that by sometime next week, they will sign the=20
Transfer Agreement so that all trades could be confirmed under Utilicorp.
