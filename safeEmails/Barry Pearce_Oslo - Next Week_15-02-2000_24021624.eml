Hey Brent,

Jan Erland has just called me from Oslo, he told you & Bjorn are due over=20
there next week.

I guess I'm a little surprised no one told me, as Jan Erland reports to me.=20
He is Local Office Controller.  I'm assuming it will be a 'post-Helsinki'=20
type review, right? Is there any particular things they/you would like to=20
look at or discuss?

As you know we operate some of the IBS functions from Oslo and some from=20
London. I'm happy to discuss this further. Do your people need an=20
introduction to the operation etc...?

Hope your well, Barry.
