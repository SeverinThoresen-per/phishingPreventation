I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What=

a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except=
=20
for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugen=
e=20
by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while the=
y=20
tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of=
=20
tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had=20
some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing=20
process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big=20
help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur=20
visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They=
=20
spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and=20
wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now unti=
l=20
the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm=20
looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid=20
but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.

How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a=20
place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August. =20
Sue is Charles' godmother.

Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for=20
thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol

Dear  Carol, Bill, and Arthur...

Have been thinking of you and the impending "arrival" in a big way, these
days...and as a result, wrote a little poem concerning him....and you....her=
e
goes....

                       TO THE CHILD
    You're coming soon, little one
       To fill their lives with love and fun
        and hope, and joy...
        Their second son.....
         You lucky, lucky boy!

                        TO THE PARENTS
            This gift from 'God
             is making his debut...
             In just a few days
              he's coming to you
              To be loved,
               to be fed,
                to be put to bed
                 with music and lullabies
                  and kisses when he cries....

                                    TO HIS BROTHER

                   You will help him
                     as he grows,
                    And love and protect him,
                     Heaven knows!
                     And there'll be no other
                      like his big brother!

                                      TO THE FAMILY AS ONE

                      So love him lots
                       with all your heart..
                       And help him
                        as he makes his start
                        into this world
                         so very strange
                         with every day,
                          some kind of change........
                           But, as one, I know
                            you wonderful "three"
                            Will adore this addition
                             To your "family tree".....


     With much love,
           Annie Bananie

 Hope all goes well for you, Carol.....You are always in my thoughts and
prayers....
  Let  me know when the great event happens.....



                                           .
