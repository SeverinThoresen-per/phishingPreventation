	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or=
 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the=
 following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of =
the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be correc=
ted, we would like for Measurement to send=20
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstandin=
g

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th,=
 which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able =
to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in callin=
g the field, please let us know.=20
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and =
helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If =
you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn
