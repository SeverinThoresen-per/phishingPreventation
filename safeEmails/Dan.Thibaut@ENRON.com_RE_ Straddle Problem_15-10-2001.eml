Tara,

It appears our EOL problem has not been resolved.  According to Larry, his s=
traddle products are not being booked correctly in TAGG.  Specifically TAGG =
deal#Y99608.1 has only the call leg of the straddle.  Would you please check=
 into this and let Larry or myself know what we can do to resolve this issue=
=2E

Thanks,

Dan =20

It will have to be someone from comformations.  We never interact with the c=
ustomer.  Also, This fix will only affect deals on a go forward basis.  All =
the deals that have been booked incorrectly will need to be fixed by risk.  =
Myself, and Tagg IT are still working on the issue, and will be in contact w=
ith you as soon as it has bee fixed.  Thanks TARA

th C/P?  If not deal confirmations could but they need the deal details.

Thanks,

Dan
