Subject: Update on PRC Process

Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior=
=20
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the proces=
s=20
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton=
=20
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting=20
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should=20
be the end of July. =20

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to=20
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24. =
=20
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not=20
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single=20
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you=
=20
updated on this as I get direction from him. =20

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  I=
n=20
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review=
=20
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when=20
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be=20
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups=
=20
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however,=20
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view=20
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the=20
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that=20
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees=20
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory=20
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific area=
s=20
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in=
=20
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc. =20

Also please note the following:=20

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or=20
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given=20
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with=20
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated proces=
s=20
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this proces=
s=20
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team=
,=20
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced=20
members of your management team, or those management team members where you=20
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and=20
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time=20
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow=20
through on this commitment. =20

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a=20
meaningful one. =20






It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0
