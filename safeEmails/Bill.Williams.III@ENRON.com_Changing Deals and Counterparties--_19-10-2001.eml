Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now cha=
rging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4=
, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transact=
ed with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate=
 our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an ema=
il to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions =
just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This t=
urned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do n=
ot fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like =
ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC do=
es not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight th=
rough morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks,=20
Bill
