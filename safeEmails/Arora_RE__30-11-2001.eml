Shaka man

Hope you are having a good time.  Things did indeed move out of control soon=
er than anyone could have imagined.  Its been one heck of an experience watc=
hing the situation and learning about how leadership works and how markets c=
an make you and destroy you.

As to what next, my first idea is to just take time off and chill out for a =
few weeks and then see what to do next.

Talk to you soon


Harry
