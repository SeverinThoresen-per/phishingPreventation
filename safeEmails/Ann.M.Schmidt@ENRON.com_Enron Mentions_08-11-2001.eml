Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy trading and power company, was attempt=
ing to strike a deal yesterday evening to buy Enron Corp., its beleaguered h=
ometown rival, for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, one-tenth of w=
hat Enron was worth 15 months ago.=20
Because any merger of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months an=
d Enron needs to shore up its beleaguered finances now, Dynegy also is expec=
ted to inject an additional $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people fami=
liar with the matter said. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns a 26% stake in Dy=
negy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and=
 is playing a significant role in the negotiations. ChevronTexaco then will =
inject an additional $1 billion into the combined company once the deal is c=
oncluded so that its stake in Dynegy isn't substantially reduced and so the =
combined company has a healthy balance sheet.
With Enron in a weak bargaining position, Dynegy, which is one-fifth Enron's=
 size, was hoping to clinch a deal which would have it paying little, if any=
, premium for Enron. The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron were meeting ye=
sterday to discuss a potential deal, but a seesawing Enron stock price and t=
he complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal, people familiar with=
 the matter warned. "This is far from over," said one person familiar with t=
he negotiations. Several important points, including the exchange ratio, wer=
e still being worked out. Dynegy expects to argue that Enron shareholders wi=
ll benefit from the upside of combining the two companies and that a transac=
tion will add to Dynegy's earnings because of potential synergies.=20
Spokesmen from Enron and Dynegy declined to comment.=20
If approved by regulators, the deal would be a stunning development for Enro=
n, which transformed itself from a staid natural-gas-pipeline company into a=
 highflying power-trading giant only to see its share price -- and hefty mar=
ket valuation -- plummet in a matter of weeks. And for Enron to sell itself =
for a low price is sure to stun investors.=20
Under the terms being worked out last night, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay woul=
d have a seat on the combined company's board, but wouldn't hold any formal =
management position, said the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lay may t=
ake on a consulting role. Meanwhile, Chuck Watson, chairman and chief execut=
ive of Dynegy, would be CEO of the combined company, while his No. 2, Stephe=
n Bergstrom, will president.=20
Enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a promine=
nt outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms an=
d power-trading companies. The company desperately needs to win back its cre=
dibility on Wall Street following the disclosure that the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a he=
dge against fluctuating market conditions. Discussions between Dynegy and En=
ron began about 10 days ago, but intensified last weekend.=20
Enron also is expected today to disclose more financial dealings about the p=
artnerships. A person close to Dynegy said the potential acquirer feels it u=
nderstands Enron's business and is apprised of the liabilities, which have b=
een factored into the transaction.=20
Should Enron strike a deal, it hopes to stabilize its stock price. Enron fel=
l 6.4%, or 62 cents, to $9.05 at 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St=
ock Exchange. At one point yesterday morning, Enron's stock had fallen 25% o=
n news reports that Enron's efforts to line up investors had failed. The sto=
ck recovered after CNBC and Dow Jones Newswires reported the talks with Dyne=
gy. The shares are at a new 52-week low and far from the 52-week high of $84=
=2E88.=20
Dynegy fell $3, or 8.3%, to $33, at 4 p.m. in Big Board trading. However, so=
me investors believed the company's share price could benefit from the deal.=
=20
Jason Selch, an energy analyst at Wanger Asset Management in Chicago, a larg=
e Dynegy shareholder, said the company has a history of pulling off complica=
ted deals and added that because Enron is in such bad shape, Dynegy could di=
ctate the terms of the deal, shielding itself from potential losses due to s=
hareholder lawsuits or problems with Enron's complicated off-balance sheet d=
ealings.=20
"If they make an offer, they will be making an offer in order to get a steal=
," said Mr. Selch, who says Enron's core energy-trading business is being va=
lued at about half the normal market valuation of these operations. "I think=
 they will be acquiring a business that will launch them into the No. 1 mark=
et-share position in energy trading," Mr. Selch added.=20
Whether a deal with Dynegy materializes, the fact that Enron is willing to c=
onsider a sale shows how its fortunes have sagged and underscores how desper=
ate it is for a savior. The company, which was at the pinnacle of its succes=
s just a year earlier, boasted a market capitalization of $71 billion about =
a year ago and is now valued at about $7 billion.=20
In exchange for the immediate capital infusion, Dynegy is expected to get co=
nvertible preferred stock. In that type of deal, an investor receives a safe=
, bondlike interest payment and then can convert that holding into common st=
ock after the share price rises to a specified level. Enron also had been so=
liciting interest from private equity firms, but any discussions with those =
parties were proceeding on a slower track.=20
People familiar with the negotiations said it was possible the financial pla=
yers could still play some sort of role in any Enron transaction, although d=
etails weren't immediately available. Buyout firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice =
and Blackstone Group, which had been approached by Enron to make an investme=
nt, decided against doing so, according to people familiar with the matter. =
Indeed, Enron's move to publicly disclose new information about the partners=
hips could provide intriguing details to any other potential bidders who are=
 interested in a deal, but were reluctant to pursue Enron without knowing mo=
re about those transactions. And because Dynegy may only be paying a small p=
remium, another suitor may be able to step up to the plate.=20
The deal, if agreed to, will add to Dynegy's earnings in the first year. The=
 new entity will focus on the core business of North American and European w=
holesale, commercial and industrial energy markets and will capitalize on th=
e opportunities generated by the combined, diversified asset-backed network =
supported by the strongest intellectual capital in the industry.=20
Aside from restoring confidence among its investors, Enron has faced growing=
 pressure from its trading partners. The company is offering special protect=
ions to some trading partners, hoping to prevent a mass exodus due to fears =
it could face further credit downgrades or wind up seeking the protection of=
 a federal bankruptcy court.=20
The protection takes the form of a "netting agreement" that permits a tradin=
g partner to offset the sums it is owed by various Enron entities against th=
e amounts that it owes the Enron concerns.=20
Without such an arrangement, a company might owe money to one Enron entity b=
ut have to stand in a long, slow line to collect sums owed by a different En=
ron concern should the company seek bankruptcy-court protection. With nettin=
g, positions could cancel each other out, at least to some extent, and reduc=
e a firm's ultimate credit exposure.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has plenty of cash and has no n=
eed or intention of seeking protection from creditors, with whom it is curre=
nt.=20

Dynegy Is Said to Be Near to Acquiring Enron for $8 Billion
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

11/08/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The board of Dynegy Inc. tentatively approved a deal last night to acquire t=
he Enron Corporation, the once-mighty energy-trading company laid low by a f=
inancial crisis and government investigation, executives close to the transa=
ction said.=20
A deal would enable Dynegy to buy the much bigger Enron at a fire-sale price=
 -- about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share, for a company that le=
ss than a year ago had a market value of nearly $70 billion. But with stock =
and bond investors fleeing, some of its trading partners refusing to do busi=
ness with it, Enron had few choices but to talk to Dynegy.
As part of the deal, Chevron Texaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy=
, would give Enron a cash infusion of at least $1.5 billion up front and an =
additional $1 billion when the deal closed.=20
The executives said the companies hope to finalize the details and announce =
the deal today.=20
If completed, a takeover by Dynegy, a company only about one-quarter its siz=
e in revenue, would represent a remarkable humbling of Enron, the nation's b=
iggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. Enron had $139.7 bil=
lion in revenue for the first nine months of the year.=20
As recently as last spring Enron was lionized by investors as an innovator t=
hat had in many ways created and cleverly dominated the nation's deregulated=
 energy markets. It would also vindicate not only Dynegy, which took a more =
measured approach to doing business in those markets, but also critics uncom=
fortable with energy deregulation who said Enron's energy trading was ruthle=
ss, its finances murky and its power and influence too extensive.=20
The company's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, is a close frien=
d of President Bush. He has been one of Mr. Bush's largest campaign contribu=
tors, and no other energy company gave more money to Republican causes last =
year than Enron. Mr. Lay would be on the board of the combined companies, th=
e executives said, but it was unclear if he would have an operational role.=20
Enron's problems came to light last month when the company disclosed $1 bill=
ion in write-downs and an unusual $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equi=
ty. The reduction in equity arose from transactions with investment partners=
hips involving Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer, who was forced to=
 resign on Oct. 24. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating =
those transactions.=20
Enron is expected today to send the S.E.C. answers to questions the agency h=
as posed in its investigation. The answers have been reviewed by Dynegy offi=
cials, the executives said, and are expected to be released publicly.=20
Enron is scheduled to meet its creditors tomorrow about the company's contin=
uing crisis -- and about the merger deal, if there is one.=20
People close to the deal say the company hopes that a deal with Dynegy, and =
the release of the answers to the S.E.C., will calm the crisis that has engu=
lfed the company and led other energy companies that trade with Enron to cur=
tail their credit exposure to the company.=20
Besides worries about the huge losses and the S.E.C. investigation, investor=
s and creditors are nervously watching Enron's credit rating. Moody's Invest=
ors Service and Standard and Poor's have already cut the rating to two notch=
es above junk status, and on Monday, Fitch Inc. cut it to one notch above ju=
nk.=20
As part of the acquisition, Dynegy would be taking on Enron's $12.8 billion =
debt load -- a number that does not include billions of dollars of other deb=
t, accumulated off the balance sheet, that has played a major role in Enron'=
s current problems. The executives said they expected the deal would lead to=
 the sale of some Enron assets to pay down the $12.8 billion debt.=20
Should Enron lose its investment grade rating, other energy trading companie=
s could curtail their business with the company even further, and Enron coul=
d be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover off-balanc=
e sheet debts that it has guaranteed.=20
Early Wednesday, shares of Enron plunged 28 percent, to about $7, on fears t=
hat the company was unable to line up new investors.=20
But the stock took back most of its losses in the afternoon after CNBC repor=
ted the talks with Dynegy. Shares of Enron closed at $9.05, off 62 cents. Dy=
negy shares closed at $33, down $3.=20
In addition to both companies' very large presence in energy trading, Enron =
owns the Portland General Electric Company, a utility in Oregon it had alrea=
dy agreed to sell, and Dynegy owns the Illinova Corporation, a retail electr=
icity and natural gas utility in Illinois.=20
Regulators may take a hard look at those utilities in reviewing a merger dea=
l, said Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company in Houston. ''Then y=
ou've got concerns about market power,'' he said. ''It's just a lot of diffe=
rent issues to deal with before we get too excited that this deal is going t=
o get done.''=20
The acquisition would combine Enron, which dominates United States trading o=
f electricity and natural gas and has been shedding its hard assets, with Dy=
negy, a company that has pursued a much different strategy of using trading =
to maximize earnings from its power plants.=20
Enron has always concentrated on sophisticated financial trading strategies,=
 a senior executive at a rival energy-trading firm, said. ''Dynegy has alway=
s been more of a logistical player of physical assets,'' he said. ''Those ar=
e very different cultures and very different mentalities.'' The executive no=
ted that there had been an immense talent drain from Enron in the last two w=
eeks. ''It has become a frenzy,'' he said.

Trading Places: Fancy Finances Were Key to Enron's Success, And Now to Its D=
istress --- Impenetrable Deals Have Put Firm in Position Where It May Lose I=
ndependence --- Talks With Rival Dynegy
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When Enron Corp. convened its annual conference with credit analysts and bon=
d investors in Houston last February, the energy-trading giant was soaring a=
nd looking to climb higher.=20
The company's stock was trading at about $80 a share, giving it a stock mark=
et value of $70 billion. Though up fourfold from three years earlier, the st=
ock price wasn't nearly high enough, Enron's new chief executive, Jeffrey Sk=
illing, told the audience. With its dominant position in energy-trading mark=
ets and its highly touted new moves into telecommunications, Enron stock sho=
uld be at $126 a share, Mr. Skilling argued.
All in all, a vintage performance for a company not known for being bashful.=
 "A lot of hype. A lot of spin," recalls Todd Shipman, a Standard & Poor's a=
nalyst who attended the conference. "That was Enron."=20
Yesterday, Enron stock closed at $9.05 in New York Stock Exchange trading. M=
r. Skilling is no longer around to promote the stock. In August, he unexpect=
edly resigned as chief executive after only six months in the top job. Chief=
 financial officer Andrew Fastow was replaced last month as controversy esca=
lated over his role in running private partnerships involved in billions of =
dollars of transactions with Enron. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive, ha=
s had to give up retirement plans to return to the helm.=20
Lately, the company has been offering special credit protection to increasin=
gly nervous trading partners, including Reliant Energy Inc. and Entergy Corp=
=2E The goal: to provide assurance that Enron is a creditworthy partner and =
to prevent an exodus of customers. Enron's trading operation generates 90% o=
f the company's profits.=20
It looked yesterday as if the endgame might be beginning. Mr. Lay and Enron'=
s board were discussing a possible acquisition of Enron by its much-smaller =
hometown energy-trading rival, Dynegy Inc., in a stock swap valued at $7 bil=
lion to $8 billion. (See related article on page A3.)=20
Any merger of the two companies would probably face lengthy regulatory scrut=
iny, so Dynegy is also considering injecting $1.5 billion into Enron immedia=
tely to help stabilize the company's finances, according to people familiar =
with the situation. The deal would also include a significant role for oil p=
owerhouse ChevronTexaco, which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy and would be likel=
y to provide much of the cash for any Enron transaction.=20
Dynegy's emergence as a serious bidder for Enron could indicate to other int=
erested parties that Enron's problems can be solved. In fact, the collapse i=
n Enron's stock price would make it fairly easy for another large energy pla=
yer to top any Dynegy offer. Royal Dutch/Shell Group is one such prominent c=
ompany.=20
A takeover by Dynegy or any other company would almost certainly presage the=
 departure of the 59-year-old Mr. Lay. He oversaw the transformation of Enro=
n from a nondescript natural-gas pipeline company with annual revenue of und=
er $5 billion in the late 1980s to a global energy colossus with revenue tha=
t is expected to approach $200 billion this year.=20
It has turned out that the formula behind that transformation contained the =
seeds for the company's current troubles. Executives created an ever-more-la=
byrinthine financial structure to support Enron's explosive growth rate. Bil=
lions of dollars of debt -- which could have weakened Enron's credit rating =
and slowed growth -- was kept off the balance sheet through tangled webs of =
transactions with dozens of related entities. As the financial demands becam=
e greater and the transactions more complex, Enron officials began creating =
and heading some of the entities, raising serious conflict-of-interest quest=
ions.=20
Neither Enron nor Dynegy would comment. Royal Dutch/Shell also declined to c=
omment. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow either declined to comment or didn'=
t return phone calls seeking interviews.=20
Enron officials have maintained that the markets are overreacting to a spate=
 of bad, but nonfatal, news. On Oct. 16, the company announced a $618 millio=
n third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder e=
quity due in part to dealings with the Fastow-related partnerships. The comp=
any has said that its ongoing businesses are strong and it has the financial=
 wherewithal to weather the crisis. All of its actions have been legal and p=
roperly disclosed, Enron has stressed.=20
Still, its predicament is daunting. The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as started a formal investigation into possible violations of federal securi=
ties law involving the Fastow-related partnerships. Several shareholder laws=
uits seeking class-action status have been filed against top company officia=
ls, alleging fraud and seeking to recover some of the $20 billion in market =
value that Enron shares have lost in the past month. To address growing jitt=
ers in the energy and financial markets, Enron has drawn down billions of do=
llars of credit lines, negotiated new ones and sought a new equity infusion.=
=20
As turmoil has engulfed the company, Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives =
have kept largely out of public view -- in sharp contrast to the company's n=
ormally outspoken public persona. The one recent public-relations initiative=
, a conference call for analysts and big investors, turned into what even En=
ron officials concede privately was a debacle. It left company executives lo=
oking evasive and defensive rather than open and confident.=20
How did Enron, which routinely made published lists of the most-admired and =
innovative companies in America, fly so high and fall so fast? The answer li=
es in a combination of brilliance and overconfidence on a scale rarely seen =
in the business world.=20
In the process, the company helped redefine much of the energy marketplace o=
n matters as fundamental as how power is bought and sold and how a company p=
roduces a profit from doing so. For example, the company helped create an el=
ectricity-trading market in which participants rarely take physical delivery=
 of the commodity but instead merely tally profits or losses from transactio=
ns.=20
In the accounting realm, it pioneered techniques that allowed energy compani=
es to record profits or losses on long-term contracts that hadn't yet produc=
ed any revenue. "We caught a little flak in the early 1990s from people who,=
 I guess, thought we were pulling a fast one," Enron's chief accounting offi=
cer, Richard Causey, said in an interview in August. He added that this acco=
unting method was the most accurate way to measure energy-trading results.=20
Enron's audacity and success sent other energy companies scrambling to emula=
te it, a process that ABN Amro analyst Paul Patterson calls "Enron envy."=20
The company tested the limits of securities and accounting rules. For exampl=
e, Enron's SEC filings have included statements about the Fastow-related tra=
nsactions that might meet the letter of disclosure laws but are so complex t=
hat even some Wall Street analysts and accounting professors have found them=
 indecipherable.=20
Enron's seemingly impenetrable financial structure, hardly noticed by Wall S=
treet in the company's heyday, is now a matter of serious concern in a sudde=
nly skeptical investment community. "It's not easy to regain something as ba=
sic as trust," says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer, a longtime Enron =
fan. In the recent conference call with Enron executives, Mr. Fleischer plea=
ded with the company to be more forthcoming about its operations -- somethin=
g it has been promising to do for months.=20
While Enron employs some 20,000 people, its rise and fall can, in large meas=
ure, be traced to three men: Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow. Mr. Lay joine=
d the company in 1984 when it was still called Houston Natural Gas, a region=
al pipeline operator. Back then, the natural-gas industry was a largely regi=
onal business and about as exciting as watching a pipeline operate.=20
But Mr. Lay had big plans for his company, always preaching that natural gas=
 was the fuel of the future. His prediction has been largely borne out when =
it comes to such functions as fueling electric-power plants.=20
He wanted to take the company beyond natural gas. Enron bought an electric u=
tility in Portland, Ore., and built power plants around the world. It develo=
ped its potent energy-trading operation, which buys and sells contracts to p=
rovide electricity in the same way that contracts for wheat and pork bellies=
 are traded. These deals were done with utilities, industrial power users an=
d other trading firms.=20
To help enlarge this empire, he recruited aggressive young executives. None =
was brighter or more assertive than Mr. Skilling, a Harvard Business School =
graduate and former McKinsey & Co. consultant who joined Enron in 1990.=20
Under Messrs. Lay and Skilling, the company pushed zealously for the deregul=
ation of energy markets -- particularly that bastion of monopoly businesses,=
 the electric-utility industry. Enron officials argued that open, competitiv=
e markets could help consumers and, not coincidentally, provide huge profit =
opportunities in energy trading.=20
Mr. Skilling called the energy-trading business "a once-in-a-lifetime opport=
unity to establish a position to last for the next 100 years." By the late 1=
990s, Enron had evolved into primarily a trading company, rather than an own=
er of power plants and pipelines.=20
In pursuit of their deregulation goals, Enron officials became major players=
 in American politics. Mr. Lay has given nearly $2 million to President Bush=
 during his political career and is a personal friend of the president, Vice=
 President Cheney and several members of the cabinet.=20
One of Mr. Skilling's early hires after joining Enron was Mr. Fastow, at the=
 time a 29-year-old MBA from Northwestern's Kellogg School who had been work=
ing on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at Continental Bank in =
Chicago. Former Enron officials and others say that Mr. Skilling quickly bec=
ame Mr. Fastow's mentor in the same way that Mr. Lay had become Mr. Skilling=
's.=20
As Mr. Skilling oversaw the building of Enron's vast trading operation, Mr. =
Fastow saw to the financing of it. "Andy was the guy you saw when you wanted=
 money" for a project, says one former Enron senior manager.=20
Mr. Skilling was named Enron's chief operating officer in 1997. Mr. Fastow g=
ot the top finance job a year later, at the age of 36. Under Mr. Fastow, Enr=
on's finance department tripled in size, to more than 100 people.=20
Enron needed the added financial brainpower. As it expanded, debt and liquid=
ity were constant concerns. What's more, the company's ambitions were roving=
 beyond therms and kilowatts as it began to make markets in everything from =
water to weather.=20
Enron's most highly touted non-energy initiative, and Mr. Skilling's pet pro=
ject, came in the area of telecommunications. The company built a coast-to-c=
oast fiber-optic network and envisioned trading "bandwidth," or network capa=
city, the way it traded electricity or natural gas. Enron has invested sever=
al hundred million dollars so far in the project, which has produced losses =
of over $400 million. Yet at the February analyst meeting in Houston, Mr. Sk=
illing unabashedly valued Enron's fiber-optic business at $36 billion, accor=
ding to people who were at the meeting.=20
But to make all of its growth dreams possible, Enron had to make sure that i=
ts balance sheet didn't become too laden with debt. Too much debt would lead=
 major ratings agencies, such as Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Po=
or's, to lower Enron's credit rating. Such downgrades could significantly in=
crease the company's cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to finance=
 its continued expansion.=20
In typically aggressive fashion, Enron lobbied the ratings agencies with the=
 same vigor that it lobbied legislators. At the February meeting, Mr. Fastow=
 urged analysts to raise Enron's credit rating on long-term debt from triple=
-B-plus to single-A-minus. But the analysts shrugged off Mr. Fastow's entrea=
ties. They didn't see the cash flow, earnings, or debt coverage required for=
 such an upgrade, says one attendee.=20
Undeterred, Mr. Fastow said the higher rating would strengthen the company's=
 basic finances, which could then justify the higher rating. This circular a=
rgument provoked derision among analysts, and Enron didn't get its `A' ratin=
g. Instead, the company was recently downgraded by the major ratings agencie=
s as a result of its financial turmoil.=20
In moves that kept down its reported debt burden, Enron turned increasingly =
to off-balance-sheet transactions through limited partnerships with outside =
parties. In such an arrangement, Enron could contribute money, stock or othe=
r assets to the partnership. The partnership could then borrow large sums to=
 purchase assets or do business deals without the debt showing up on Enron's=
 books.=20
While such partnership transactions had long been used in the natural-gas in=
dustry to finance deals, Enron took the practice to new heights of complexit=
y. Leading that effort was Mr. Fastow and his team of young financial expert=
s.=20
In recent years, Enron has done myriad deals with more than 30 partnerships.=
 By far the most controversial to come to light, so far, are the ones it has=
 done with two partnerships -- known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment=
 LP -- which were formed and operated by Mr. Fastow. The company has said th=
at its transactions with these partnerships were designed to hedge against f=
luctuating market values of company assets and energy contracts.=20
It isn't clear why Enron would allow its chief financial officer to be in a =
fiduciary position at partnerships that stood to profit, possibly at the com=
pany's expense, from doing deals with it. To make matters worse, private LJM=
 partnership documents indicate that Mr. Fastow personally made millions of =
dollars from the partnerships -- much more than he was being paid as Enron's=
 chief financial officer.=20
Enron officials have repeatedly said that Mr. Fastow's actions were reviewed=
 and approved by top management and the board of directors. However, the com=
pany has refused to answer numerous specific questions about its dealings wi=
th the partnerships. Enron has said that Mr. Fastow formally severed his tie=
s with the partnerships in July in the face of rising discomfort about the a=
rrangements on the part of analysts and major company investors.=20
It is nearly impossible to stitch together anything comprehensible about the=
 partnership deals from Enron's SEC filings. The only thing clear is that mi=
llions of shares of Enron stock and billions of dollars of assets and notes =
were involved in the transactions.=20

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp., the troubled energy-trading giant, was in talks Wed=
nesday over a possible takeover by Houston neighbor and rival Dynegy Inc., i=
ndustry sources said.=20
The boards of both companies were meeting late Wednesday concerning a potent=
ial deal, which almost certainly would mean the end of the line for Chairman=
 and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, architect of Enron's emergence as the domi=
nant force in the relatively new electronic markets for natural gas and elec=
tricity.
The Houston Chronicle reported that ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 27% of D=
ynegy, would inject an immediate $1.5 billion to enable Enron to maintain it=
s investment-grade credit status, without which it would have to suspend its=
 crucial trading operations.=20
Enron, Dynegy and ChevronTexaco representatives declined to comment.=20
Enron appeared to be running out of options short of an outright sale, as it=
s stock had plunged toward 10-year lows, its credit had been downgraded and =
it had failed to secure emergency financing from parties that would let it r=
etain its independence.=20
Enron's shares plunged again Wednesday but then recovered on the news, first=
 reported by CNBC, that it had opened talks with Dynegy.=20
Enron shares sank as low as $7 on the New York Stock Exchange but rebounded =
to close down 62 cents at $9.05, still the lowest since April 1992; the stoc=
k is down 89% year to date. Dynegy shares also moved on the speculation, los=
ing $3 to close at $33.=20
At Wednesday's closing price, Enron has a market value of $6.8billion, down =
from an August 2000 peak of $63.6 billion.=20
The catalyst for Enron's shocking slide was the disclosure last month that t=
he company had taken a $1.2-billion equity reduction connected with off-bala=
nce-sheet partnerships from which Enron managers had profited.=20
The matter is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Enron also reported an unexpected $618-million loss in the third quarter.=20
The energy market's confidence in Enron's ability to meet its obligations ha=
s ebbed along with the company's stock price, and trading partners have begu=
n shying away from entering new long-term transactions with Enron, industry =
sources said.=20
Competitors Reliant Energy Inc., Aquila Inc. and El Paso Corp. all reported =
a pickup in business as companies attempt to reduce their exposure to Enron.=
=20
In addition, energy brokers on the New York Mercantile Exchange are demandin=
g higher margin deposits from Enron, according to Platts, a private energy n=
ews service. Enron in recent days has been raising cash by turning over trad=
ing positions to other companies at a sizable discount, Platts said.=20
Banking sources told the Financial Times in London that Enron has called an =
emergency meeting of its lenders to persuade them to extend credit lines.=20
Enron last week won a commitment for a $1-billion credit line from J.P. Morg=
an Chase and Salomon Smith Barney, but other banks declined to join in. To g=
et the financing, Enron had to pledge some natural gas pipeline assets.=20
Although there has been no crisis akin to a run on a bank, Enron cannot surv=
ive for long without a major infusion of capital, Todd A. Shipman, analyst f=
or Standard & Poor's, said Wednesday.=20
"There's a difference between reducing exposure to Enron and not doing busin=
ess or demanding cash upfront," he said, but he added that the company's tra=
ding partners have been "reexamining their attitude towards Enron every mome=
nt of every day."=20
Energy analysts and executives said Wednesday that Dynegy Chairman and CEO C=
harles L. Watson could be taking a big risk buying into Enron.=20
"Chuck Watson is a brave guy but also a smart one," one expert said. "I have=
 to assume he knows what he's getting with Enron."=20
Would-be partners Watson and Lay have competed for prominence in Houston, ar=
guing over stadiums and investing to bring the National Football League to t=
he city.=20
Consumer activists wasted no time protesting a potential merger of Enron and=
 Dynegy.=20
Dynegy, which owns California power plants in partnership with NRG Energy In=
c. that are capable of generating 2,800 megawatts of electricity, was among =
the companies Gov. Gray Davis and other politicians have repeatedly slammed =
as "pirates" that charged the state too much for electricity during its rece=
nt energy crisis.=20
"The energy cartel already has done so much damage in California, and the on=
ly thing worse than that would be a more tightly controlled energy cartel," =
said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights in Santa M=
onica. "These are two lawless cowboys forming a single bandit."=20
As board meetings continued Wednesday night in Houston, sources said a deal =
was probable at about $8 billion, or $10 to $11 an Enron share.=20
Despite Enron's serious troubles, its trading business remains potentially p=
owerful. Even in the company's duress, the trading operation has gone forwar=
d, accounting for more than 25% of all electric power and natural gas traded=
 globally. Enron, which took in $147 billion in revenue in the first nine mo=
nths of this year, processes transactions worth an estimated $2billion a day=
=2E=20
If Dynegy were to add the immense trading operations of Enron and prove able=
 to hold the franchise together, it would become a major power in global ene=
rgy tradingDynegy also has a trading operation, but mostly it trades for the=
 benefit of its own electric power and natural gas holdings; partner Chevron=
Texaco, the recently merged oil giant, would gain a significant edge in ener=
gy trading over its competitors.=20
"Dynegy is conservative, while Enron has been very aggressive in trading," s=
aid Mark Gurley, senior vice president of Aquila.=20

The board of Enron, the embattled US energy trading group, was meeting last =
night to discuss a takeover by its rival Dynegy.=20
Terms of the proposed deal remain under discussion but are understood to inv=
olve an all-stock bid from Dynegy at an undetermined premium to its Dollars =
6.8bn market capitalisation.=20
ChevronTexaco, which owns about 27 per cent of Dynegy, was expected to provi=
de about Dollars 1.5bn of financial support. An announcement could come this=
 morning, though people familiar with the talks cautioned that they might st=
ill fail.=20
Enron agreed to call an urgent meeting of its banks for tomorrow amid growin=
g concerns on Wall Street that it would not be able to survive its financial=
 crisis without a strategic partner.=20
If Enron's board rejects the full takeover offer, other potential options in=
clude an equity injection by Dynegy to save the troubled energy trader from =
a deeper financial crisis.=20
Dynegy, which trades with Enron, has an interest in keeping the struggling g=
roup in business to maintain stability in the energy market but also sees an=
 opportunity to expand its own market share.=20
Banks are describing tomorrow's meeting at Enron's headquarters in Houston a=
s "make or break". One bank executive said: "This is a pivotal meeting. Ther=
e are lots of credit lines due in the next six months and we need to talk." =
Enron drew down Dollars 3.3bn in credit lines in the last month, in an attem=
pt to build confidence.=20
With time running out for the company and pressure increasing on Kenneth Lay=
, its chief executive, Enron has urgently explored several options in recent=
 days. Shell-owned Coral Energy has also been approached and there have been=
 calls to private equity groups.=20
If the Dynegy deal goes through, Mr Lay will stay on at Enron, at least unti=
l the takeover is complete.=20
But the efforts have been hampered by the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 investigation into Enron's dealings with funds associated with the former c=
hief financial officer of the company. Bankers say that companies that do no=
t already know Enron intimately have been put off entering negotiations beca=
use of the uncertainty.=20
If the company fails to complete a deal ahead of tomorrow's crucial meeting,=
 it will need to persuade the banks to extend credit lines, as it battles to=
 shore up confidence among investors and its trading counterparties.=20
The banks with the greatest exposure to Enron include Credit Suisse, Deutsch=
e Bank, Citigroup and Barclays. Off-balance-sheet vehicles affiliated to Enr=
on have Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn in debt. Enron itself is carrying Dollars 12=
=2E8bn in debt. Its bonds ended the day bid at 74 cents in the dollar. Enron=
's share price had dropped as low as Dollars 7 early in the day but finished=
 at Dollars 9.05, down 62 cents, after reports of Dynegy's interest.=20
Investors' concern about Dynegy assuming Enron's liabilities sent Dynegy sha=

Houston Chronicle
Dynegy may acquire Enron=20
Merger talks in advanced stage=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Dynegy was in advanced talks Wednesday night to acquire troubled rival Enron=
 Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.=20
The sources said a merger could be announced as early as today between the t=
wo Houston-based energy traders, which had been talking for about a week.=20
If the smaller Dynegy does buy Enron -- known as a pioneer in the world of e=
nergy trading -- it would mark a surprising end for a company that until ear=
ly this year was among Wall Street's darlings.=20
Since then, a series of problems has tarnished the image of Enron, which bas=
ed on revenues is Houston's largest company. Enron's woes quickly multiplied=
 after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third-quarter earnings=
 report last month.=20
After the report, Enron's stock price plummeted, the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission launched an investigation into certain Enron dealings and the co=
mpany's credit rating has been downgraded, leaving it in a weakened state.=20
That's where Dynegy comes in.=20
Dynegy proposed a stock swap with a modest premium over Enron's stock price,=
 the sources said, adding that Enron had been pressing for a higher premium =
than Dynegy offered. Shares in Enron closed down 62 cents Wednesday, at $9.0=
5. Based on Enron's market capitalization, the stock deal is likely to be wo=
rth more than $7 billion.=20
As part of the deal being discussed, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 2=
7 percent of Dynegy, would also immediately give $1.5 billion to Enron, the =
people said.=20
The money would be intended to help Enron keep its investment-grade credit r=
ating, which it needs to keep running its energy trading business.=20
Wall Street has been questioning Enron's ability to maintain that core busin=
ess, which relies heavily on access to credit and cash.=20
Enron's board started meeting around 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, while Dynegy's boa=
rd began meeting earlier during the day.=20
Spokesmen for Dynegy, Enron and ChevronTexaco declined comment Wednesday.=20
Enron is significantly larger than Dynegy, which last year reported $29.4 bi=
llion in revenues and as of earlier this year had almost 1,600 employees in =
Houston. Enron reported $100.8 billion in revenues last year and as of earli=
er this year had more than 7,000 Houston employees.=20
The two energy traders have complementary capabilities, said Jeff Dietert, a=
n analyst with Houston-based Simmons & Co. International who follows Dynegy =
and Enron.=20
Enron excels in the area of financial tools and contracts used by businesses=
 to manage risk, while Dynegy has strong physical assets, including power pl=
ants and natural gas storage facilities, he said.=20
Without the specifics of the deal, Dietert said it was hard to evaluate whet=
her it made sense for Dynegy.=20
But he noted that Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, has a=
 history of doing complex deals that have boosted the company's earnings.=20
Both Enron and Dynegy grew from natural gas companies. Both expanded into th=
e business of trading energy, but Dynegy has also focused on acquiring asset=
s such as power plants.=20
Enron's current strategy has been to shed assets and expand its trading into=
 a variety of commodities ranging from paper to metals.=20
Enron has been under heavy fire since Oct. 16 when it released third-quarter=
 earnings. It disclosed that day it had taken a $35 million loss and reduced=
 shareholders equity by $1.2 billion related to ending business dealings wit=
h two investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, its chief finan=
cial officer.=20
The disclosures served to heighten Wall Street's ongoing concerns that Enron=
's financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on detail=
s. It also led to fears that Enron would be on the hook for billions of doll=
ars related to other financial vehicles.=20
Days later, Enron revealed that the SEC was investigating transactions betwe=
en Enron and the partnerships, called LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-investment. It =
also replaced Fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder l=
awsuits.=20
In the last couple days, Wall Street has grown more concerned at Enron's sil=
ence. It's led to speculation the company has more problems than are publicl=
y known. Since Oct. 16, Enron's closing share price has declined by 73 perce=
nt.=20
There have also been increasing questions about the stability of Enron's cor=
e wholesale energy trading business, which is responsible for generating the=
 vast majority of Enron's profits.=20
Enron's attempts so far to bolster investor confidence have failed.=20
Last week, it announced it had lined up $1 billion in new credit lines, but =
some investors reacted negatively to the fact that Enron used a significant =
portion of its pipeline assets as collateral.=20
The week before, Enron tapped into $3.3 billion in credit lines that weren't=
 secured by collateral. It banked about $1.1 billion and is using the rest t=
o pay off short-term debt obligations.=20
Even before the earnings release, shares in Enron -- which in late January h=
it a closing high for the year of $82 -- had been under pressure for a varie=
ty of reasons, including a troubled power project in India, problems with it=
s new broadband unit and the unexpected resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling, wh=
o stepped down in August, citing personal reasons.=20
Until the deal is announced, it's difficult to gauge how many layoffs could =
result, what could happen to Enron's two downtown headquarters towers, Enron=
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay's fate, and whether the Enron =
name will disappear, including from Enron Field.=20


Nov. 8, 2001, 12:07AM
Enron deals downshifted at breakneck speed=20
Bottom fell out of creative accounting=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Many companies say hard work and vision are secrets to success. For Enron Co=
rp., the cornerstone of its late-1990s triumphs was something more obscure: =
innovative finance.=20
Under the leadership of former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the co=
mpany took a widely used accounting procedure, off-balance-sheet financing, =
and raised it to an art form.=20
The practice, which sets up partnerships with investors to buy large assets,=
 allowed the company to grow quickly without adding significant debt or asse=
ts to its books.=20
Fastow's prowess with these partnerships earned him gushing praise from Wall=
 Street and superstar status among his peers. As one analyst said in a 1999 =
interview with CFO Magazine during the height of Enron's glory, "Fastow has =
invented a groundbreaking strategy."=20
But the once rock-solid strategy turned to loose gravel under Enron's feet.=20
A number of the complex off-balance-sheet deals came undone in recent months=
, leading the company to report close to $1 billion in related write-offs la=
st month. This brought renewed interest to Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO =
and general partner in some of the deals, from which he is reported to have =
profited personally. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a f=
ormal investigation. Even if Enron comes clean on the deals, giving the deta=
ils Wall Street has demanded for weeks, it may be too little too late.=20
Pressure from investors, a stock price plummet of more than 75 percent and d=
owngrades from the major credit rating agencies all have followed. The fall =
has come so steep and so fast that local competitor Dynegy Corp. is now work=
ing to acquire Enron in a multibillion-dollar deal.=20
Off-balance-sheet financing is a common tool among many capital-intense busi=
nesses.=20
In the simplest of terms, a company can grow without showing additional debt=
 on its balance sheet, said Ron Singer, a University of Houston professor of=
 economics. Too much debt can cut cash flow and make a company look like a h=
igher-risk borrower.=20
While there are many variations, creating an off-balance-sheet vehicle is re=
latively straightforward.=20
"You create an entity in which you have less than a 50 percent equity stake,=
 so you can claim you don't have a controlling interest," Singer said. "You =
finance it with a large amount of debt from other investors, but that debt d=
oesn't appear on your balance sheet."=20
Continental Airlines and other carriers have used a type of off-balance-shee=
t financing to buy planes, while truck rental company Ryder creates partners=
hips that fund the purchase of fleets that Ryder leases from the partnership=
s.=20
Enron's most troubling deals are different from others in three ways:=20
First, they were complex, involving many layers of partnerships. Investments=
 were in more than hard assets, including securities like equity stakes in c=
ompanies and even stock options.=20
Second, Fastow's direct involvement in the partnerships created the appearan=
ce of a conflict of interest, something most companies avoid by not having c=
orporate officers in leadership roles. The company maintains it carefully mo=
nitored the partnerships, double-checking them with a legal fine-toothed com=
b.=20
Third, and perhaps most important, Enron was loath to share details of the f=
inancing and their consequences, even after they began to unravel. The relat=
ive silence left investors and analysts to assume the worst.=20
Houston-based El Paso Corp. uses two types of off-balance-sheet financing ve=
hicles for major asset purchases. Under one model, the company works with a =
bank to create a 50/50 partnership to finance something like the constructio=
n of a power plant.=20
The bank's loan would have a particularly long term and low interest rate, a=
nd would be paid back using revenue generated by the power plant.=20
The other model, used most recently at El Paso, went into two special purpos=
e projects: Project Electron, funding the purchase of U.S. power-producing o=
perations, and Project Gem Stone, funding the creation of energy generation =
facilities in Brazil.=20
Under the two projects El Paso puts some of its own funds into the partnersh=
ips; institutional investors put up the lion's share of the money. The insti=
tutional investors, which can include pension funds, hedge funds, banks and =
other corporations, have their investments backed by the hard assets of the =
partnership.=20
Enron used simple off-balance-sheet deals in the past, but its strategy beca=
me more complex in the late 1990s as it began fueling aggressive growth plan=
s.=20
In 1997 the company's growth from a pipeline company into a leading gas and =
energy trading business led it to a huge debt load that didn't match up with=
 its credit ratings. Maintaining that rating was crucial to the company's el=
ectricity and gas trading, which involved negotiated contracts with dozens o=
f partners.=20
The company could have put up its hard assets as backing to continue financi=
ng acquisitions and purchases, but Enron's top brass were reluctant. Instead=
, under Fastow's guidance, Enron's finance department became the equivalent =
of a bank, with a mission to raise capital.=20
"We transformed finance into a merchant organization, one engaged in the int=
ermediation of both commodity and capital risk positions," Fastow told CFO M=
agazine in 1999. "Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions."=20
The company also needed to raise more cash but couldn't issue equity, which =
would dilute shareholders' value, or issue more debt, a threat to its credit=
 rating.=20
Fastow's solution was to make it clear to the rating agencies that he was se=
rious about keeping the good ratings by generating fast-growing cash flow, e=
ven though the company would issue more stock. A roadshow for analysts was o=
rganized to outline the plan and demonstrate the finance team's skills at ma=
intaining the high-wire act.=20
The sales pitch worked. When Enron issued 17.2 million shares in an offering=
 and raised about $800 million, rating agencies liked it and share values di=
dn't drop.=20
The second part of the plan involved selling off nonstrategic assets, such a=
s pipelines and other business units, to create even more cash flow. That ca=
sh was reinvested.=20
Under this new, more aggressive strategy, Enron grew in different ways. For =
example, in October 1998 the company acquired three New Jersey power plants =
from Cogen Technologies by going to the capital markets to issue about $1.5 =
billion in equity and debt. Enron kept that capital off its own balance shee=
ts by creating a special-purpose entity to which it sold a 50 percent intere=
st in the plants.=20
Another deal involved Enron's $2.3 billion purchase of Wessex Water, a Briti=
sh water company, in 1998. Enron created a special off-balance-sheet partner=
ship named Atlantic Water Trust and issued $1.3 billion in Enron shares into=
 it. The trust then went to the capital markets to raise $1 billion in debt =
that was backed by those shares.=20
The trust purchased Wessex, and because Enron owned no more than 50 percent =
of Wessex, it didn't experience earnings dilution and didn't have that $1 bi=
llion in debt counted on its books.=20
These complex deals won Fastow and his team praise and industry awards.=20
So what went wrong?=20
While many of Enron's off-balance-sheet deals worked with little controversy=
, the accounting innovation eventually worked against the company.=20
Details on the more complicated deals, particularly the partnerships named L=
JM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, which left the company with a $1 billion c=
harge last quarter, have been hard to come by so far. But they appear to hav=
e been used to hedge against the risk of some of the company's newer lines o=
f business beyond its core.=20
"Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the=
 mass retail market and using a fiber optic network to deliver content over =
the Internet are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core me=
rchant energy business," said Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barne=
y. "All of the write-offs appear to be in these noncore, nonenergy merchant =
areas."=20
The off-balance-sheet partnerships also went on to buy the stock of other co=
mpanies, said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris.=20
"They own pieces of a variety of companies they've done asset trades with, o=
il-services companies, producers," Olson said. "And many of those shares are=
 underwater right now."=20
The partnerships also appear to have invested in options to buy shares of En=
ron at a fixed price with plans to make money by later selling them at a hig=
her price.=20
"It was perfectly sound logic when their stock was going up, but when it sta=
rted to go down, it came as quite a shock," Olson said.=20
While the details of Enron's partnerships remain elusive for the time being,=
 there's little doubt that unraveling their true nature will be difficult fo=
r even the keenest financial and legal minds.=20
"There's a saying that in Houston there are three major law firms: Vinson & =
Elkins, Baker Botts and Enron," Olson said. "Enron is overstaffed with many =
smart, smart lawyers, creating these complex and sophisticated contracts. Th=
e problem is they're all in the same room just canceling each other out."=20

Officials of Enron Corp. are negotiating a sale of their embattled energy-tr=
ading company to Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. for about $8 billion in sto=
ck and an immediate cash infusion, according to sources familiar with the ta=
lks.=20
The deal would include a $1.5 billion contribution to Enron by ChevronTexaco=
 Corp. which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, sources said.
Representatives of Enron and Dynegy declined to comment.=20
The fortunes of Enron, the largest trader of natural gas and electric power =
and one of the early apostles of utility deregulation, have plunged since la=
te last month, when it announced a $638 million third-quarter loss and discl=
osed that the value of shareholder equity had dropped by $1.2 billion becaus=
e of complex investment deals with outside partnerships.=20
Enron dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who had run some=
 of the largest of these partnerships in what some investors allege was a co=
nflict of interest, according to civil lawsuits filed against Enron.=20
It also revealed a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the i=
nvestments, and it has had to scramble for additional capital as its credit =
rating was downgraded. Today, Enron is expected to make public answers about=
 the partnership transactions that it has furnished to the SEC.=20
In August, Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, resigned unexpectedly,=
 citing personal reasons, a month after Fastow severed his ties with the par=
tnerships. With Skilling's resignation, Enron Chairman Ken Lay -- the nation=
's most visible energy executive because of his close friendship with Presid=
ent Bush -- resumed the chief executive's duties.=20
Last week, Enron secured a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and =
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. to help cover debt payments and trading obligation=
s, but it had to use some of its most valuable pipeline assets to secure the=
 loan.=20
Enron's stock has fallen from a high of $90 a share in August 2000 to $9.05 =
yesterday, off 62 cents from Tuesday's closing price, after the talks were r=
eported by CNBC. The steepest price decline followed its third-quarter earni=
ngs report last month.=20
But earnings for Enron's core energy businesses increased 26 percent from th=
e year before, before write-offs, demonstrating the value of these operation=
s to other energy companies, according to Will McNamara, energy analysis dir=
ector for Scientech Inc. in Albuquerque.=20
Any transactions involving Enron must cope with the uncertainty about the im=
pact of more than a score of confidential partnership investments on the com=
pany's debt level and stock value, analysts said.=20
Two of the partnerships in which Enron has a stake, named Osprey and Marlin,=
 have borrowed $3.4 billion to purchase and then resell Enron energy assets =
and to make other investments, according to analysts.=20
"The issue is how much of that is considered debt of Enron," said Ralph G. P=
ellechia, an analyst with Fitch Inc. Fitch and other bond-rating firms have =
sharply downgraded Enron's debt this month.=20
In one of a growing number of lawsuits against Enron's board of directors, F=
red Greenberg, a Texas shareholder, alleged that Fastow had engaged in a con=
flict of interest by serving as Enron's chief financial officer while runnin=
g the private partnerships that purchased power plants and other assets from=
 Enron. Fastow was entitled to a share in partnership profits, even if that =
was contrary to Enron shareholders' interests, Greenberg's suit contends.=20
In public filings with the SEC, Enron disclosed that key corporate officers =
were involved with the partnerships and declared that its board had reviewed=
 and approved the relationships.=20
A confidential offering seeking investments in an Osprey partnership in Sept=
ember 2000 described one of those relationships in different terms. The fund=
s raised by Osprey would be turned over to another partnership, named Whitew=
ing, to which Enron was contributing $1.2 billion, the offering document sai=
d. Whitewing would use the funds to purchase Enron assets and make other inv=
estments.=20
The duties of Enron's corporate directors and officers may conflict with the=
 duties of Whitewing's officers and directors, the document said. "In additi=
on, certain other conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future" b=
ecause of the close relationship between Enron, Whitewing and its subsidiari=
es, it added.

Dynegy May Offer as Much as $8 Billion for Enron: WSJ (Update1)

Dynegy May Offer as Much as $8 Billion for Enron: WSJ (Update1)

     (Adds German trading in fifth paragraph, details on ratings
in 14th paragraph and SEC probe in 16th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may offer to buy
Enron Corp. for as much as $8 billion in stock after shares of the
biggest energy trader fell 89 percent this year, the Wall Street
Journal, New York Times and Associated Press reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.

     The boards of Dynegy, a Houston-based energy trader,
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy, and
Enron met yesterday to negotiate terms of the transaction, which
would value Enron at about $10 a share, according to the reports.
A transaction may be announced as early as today, AP said.

     Enron's stock and credit ratings have declined in the wake of
a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into
partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.
The company has drawn down $3 billion in credit lines and is
seeking new financing to reassure trading partners.

     ``Enron is running out of time and that's what's pushing them
to the bargaining table,'' said Zach Wagner, an analyst with
Edward Jones & Co., who cut his recommendation on Enron to
``reduce'' from ``accumulate'' on Oct. 23.

     Shares of Enron traded in Germany rose 28 cents $9.33. The
stock reached a record $90.75 in August 2000 and fell 62 cents to
$9.05 yesterday in U.S. trading. It has a market value of about
$6.79 billion.

     Dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business, the leading
energy manager for commercial and small-industrial customers, and
an Internet energy trading operation many times larger than its
own, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James Yanello.

                          `Stingy' Buyer

     ``If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to
acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid'' such
as overpaying for Enron, said Yanello. ``A deal could provide
Dynegy with tremendous opportunity.'' He rates Dynegy ``strong
buy'' and doesn't own shares of either company.

     Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay
wouldn't hold a management position with the combined company
under terms being discussed Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal
reported. He would get a seat on the board, the paper added.

     ChevronTexaco is considering adding $1.5 billion to the
transaction to help Enron. It would provide another $1 billion
when the purchase is closed, the New York Times and Wall Street
Journal reported.

     The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with
about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, people
familiar with the talks said.

     Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer
and ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.

                         Losing Confidence

     Companies that trade natural gas, electricity and other
commodities with Enron may pull back if Enron's finances
deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment-grade credit
rating, investors say.

     ``Dynegy has to act fast,'' said Roger Hamilton, a money
manager with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which sold its Enron
shares in recent weeks. ``If Enron can't get financing and its
bonds go to junk, they lose counterparties and their marvelous
business vanishes.''

     Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on Enron's bonds
to ``Baa2'' and Standard & Poor's cut the debt to ``BBB.'' in the
past two weeks.

     Federal regulators may overlook antitrust concerns in order
to keep Enron afloat, Hamilton said.

                             SEC Probe

     Securities regulators are investigating trading by
partnerships run by Fastow, the former financial director. The
entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets, with trades
costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity. Enron ousted CFO Andrew Fastow last month.

     Shares of Dynegy, the fifth-largest U.S. natural gas
marketer, fell $3 to $33 yesterday, while ChevronTexaco rose 48
cents to $87.28.

     Enron shares and bonds have tumbled in the past month. One of
its bonds, an issue paying 6.725 percent that matures in November
2008, fell to 69.11 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg
data, down from 71.90 cents yesterday.

     ``We would be very surprised if Dynegy buys the whole
company,'' said Tim Ghriskey, president of Ghriskey Capital
Partners, which doesn't own Enron or Dynegy shares. ``All the
(Dynegy) board has to do is look at what's happening to their
stock price today, and you'd wonder why they would want to do it
in the face of what's happening with the stock.'' Ghriskey made
his comments on Wednesday.

                       Enron Meets Creditors

     Enron is to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc.
and other lenders on Friday to discuss merger plans and a possible
increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines,
according to bankers familiar with the matter.

     The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its
offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial
team, led by its new chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the
bankers said.

     Dynegy began in 1985 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a gas-
trading company. In 1998, the company took the name Dynegy -- a
combination of the words dynamic and energy -- to reflect its
expansion beyond natural gas. Chuck Watson, the company's
president from 1985, became chairman and chief executive in 1989.

     Watson is an investor with Enron CEO Lay in the Houston
Texans, who begin playing in the National Football League next
year, and is a board member at Baker Hughes Inc. As of an April
filing with the SEC, Watson owned 12.3 million Dynegy shares, or
about 5.1 percent of the common stock.

Reports: Dynegy close to deal to buy Enron for $8 billion

HOUSTON (AP) - Dynegy Inc. is reportedly in the late stages of discussions w=
ith rival Enron Corp. to buy the embattled energy-trading company for about =
$8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 per share.=20
Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate $1.5 billion c=
ash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake i=
n Dynegy, the New York Times reported on its Web site Wednesday night, citin=
g executives close to the discussion.
Chevron Texaco would provide an additional $1 billion injection at a later d=
ate, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume $12.8 billion in Enron de=
bt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleag=
uered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its =
current problems.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay would not be given any formal management position=
 in the combined company, although he would have a seat on its board, The Wa=
ll Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.=20
The boards of both companies were meeting late Wednesday and could announce =
the deal as early as Thursday, although the Journal reported that the transa=
ction could still be derailed.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel s=
aid the company would not respond to "rumor and speculation."=20
In Wednesday trading, Dynegy's shares were down $3 to close at $33 on the Ne=
w York Stock Exchange, while Enron's stock was off 62 cents and closed at $9=
=2E05. Shares of ChevronTexaco rose 48 cents to $87.28 on the NYSE.=20
Enron's stock is off more than 79 percent since Oct. 16, when the company sa=
id shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion, in part due to partn=
erships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
At the same time, Enron reported a $618 million third quarter loss last mont=
h, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to various =
losses. Fastow was ousted a week later.=20
The company's financial stability was further weakened after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission began an inquiry, which was upgraded to a formal inv=
estigation, of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting=
 from them.=20
Jeff Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has been called to testify be=
fore the SEC, although it remains unclear when that will occur, said Denis C=
alabrese, a spokesman for Skilling.=20
Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeove=
r of the company. Before Wednesday, companies mentioned as possible suitors =
included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.=20
Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., said a merger b=
etween Enron and Dynegy makes sense.=20
"I think Dynegy could be a very good fit in terms of understanding the merch=
ant business, having a similar culture," Grubert said. "Enron was initially =
proactive at teaming up with non-competitors but once it exhausted that rout=
e" it went in another direction.=20
In the past few weeks, Enron has cashed in about $3 billion in revolving cre=
dit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. Last week, En=
ron secured $1 billion in new financing, using some of its natural gas and p=
ipeline assets as collateral.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's Corp. on Wednesday lowered its ratings on some =
of Enron's credit linked notes and placed them on CreditWatch. S&P said Enro=
n's plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other m=
eans will be insufficient.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Inc. have also downgraded the company's =
credit ratings.=20
Last week, Enron announced it created a special committee headed by Universi=
ty of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigati=

USA: UPDATE 1-Fund alleges fat fees biased Andersen on Enron.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. paid one of the largest audit bill=
s in corporate America last year to Arthur Andersen, regulatory filings show=
ed on Wednesday, as the Big Five accounting firm faced a lawsuit in Oregon a=
lleging its high-priced audit of the battered energy giant was flawed.=20
Houston-based Enron, rocked by a federal investigation and trading at histor=
ic lows, paid Arthur Andersen $52 million last year in audit and non-audit f=
ees, according to Enron's 2001 proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange =
Commission.
That figure topped the fees paid by all similarly sized utility companies li=
sted along with Enron on the Dow Jones utility index, and all but a handful =
of the 30, mostly much larger companies in the Dow Jones industrial average.=
=20
The huge revenues taken in by Arthur Andersen from Enron - comprising $25 mi=
llion in audit fees and $27 million in other fees - amounted to about $1 mil=
lion a week last year.=20
That rich revenue flow influenced the accounting firm's judgment when it cam=
e to examining some unusual outside partnership arrangements involving Enron=
 now being probed by the SEC, alleged a lawsuit filed last week in Oregon.=20
The SEC declined to comment.=20
"Arthur Andersen enjoyed a lucrative, long-standing business relationship wi=
th Enron's senior management for which they received millions of dollars," s=
aid the lawsuit filed by the Southern Electrical Retirement Fund, an electri=
cians' pension fund, against Enron officers and Arthur Andersen.=20
"Maintaining the client relationship was highly dependent on the individual =
defendants, particularly Enron's CEO (Kenneth) Lay, and Arthur Andersen comp=
romised themselves to do so," alleged Southern Electrical, which owns Enron =
shares.=20
A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said the Chicago-based firm had not seen the=
 Oregon lawsuit and declined comment. He also declined to comment on the rel=
ative size of Enron's fees.=20
The troubles of Enron beginning last month have led to numerous lawsuits aga=
inst company officers, but the Oregon action was the first known to target i=
ts auditor, as well.=20
As the first anniversary of the issuance of SEC auditor independence rules a=
pproaches next week, the Enron-Arthur Andersen relationship was coming under=
 increased scrutiny by regulators, plaintiffs' attorneys and institutional i=
nvestors.=20
CRITICS SAY ANDERSEN SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE=20
Arthur Andersen should have done more as auditor for Enron to alert investor=
s to the outside partnerships that are now being investigated by authorities=
, accounting experts said.=20
"It certainly has to raise a lot of eyebrows, especially in the independence=
 and objectivity issue," said Jay Nisberg, an accounting consultant based in=
 Ridgefield, Connecticut.=20
Arthur Andersen should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of=
 the partnerships' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to=
 Enron, critics said.=20
Enron last month ousted its chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. He was re=
placed by another Enron executive. Fastow was instrumental in setting up and=
 managing the partnerships - LJM2 Co-Investment LP and LJM Cayman LP - that =
did complex financial transactions with Enron, Fastow's employer.=20
The transactions were disclosed to Enron investors in annual 10K filings and=
 proxy statements issued in 2000 and 2001. But Andersen should have done mor=
e to put the disclosures in plain English and highlight their potential for =
possible conflicts and risk to Enron's finances, said critics.=20
"The activities of these particular partnerships and the role of Enron in th=
em, it's not the kind of thing you stick in the proxy statement at the back =
somewhere in a series of innocuous paragraphs," said Mark Cheffers, who head=
s accounting consultancy AccountingMalpractice.com in Massachusetts.=20
Enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the=
 nation's largest energy trader - said last month it was taking a $1 billion=
 charge against earnings, as well as cutting shareholder equity by $1.2 bill=
ion largely due to soured transactions with Fastow's partnerships.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne has said that Arthur Andersen knew about the L=
JM partnerships and "reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary."=20
ANDERSEN'S WOES WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT=20
Earlier on Wednesday, Waste Management Inc. said Andersen would pay the firm=
 $20 million to settle a professional malpractice suit related to an account=
ing scandal the garbage hauler was embroiled in more than two years ago.=20
Waste Management itself agreed to pay $457 million to settle a class action =
lawsuit filed against it related to the scandal and problems that hammered i=
ts share price.=20
The impact of the settlement, coupled with criticism of Andersen's handling =
of Enron, is likely to hurt Andersen's brand and influence the type of advic=
e and services it provides clients in the future, Cheffers said.=20
"It's obviously a jolt to their reputation," he said. "But the bigger questi=
on is if they're going to reevaluate the advice they give their clients."=20
In June, Arthur Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges i=
t filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management in the larges=
t ever civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm, according to the SE=
C. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.=20

Enron's power company reverses itself, says it is meeting with Indian repres=

BOMBAY, India (AP) - The U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s power company in India rev=
ersed itself and said it was attending meetings in Singapore Thursday and Fr=
iday to discuss a negotiated settlement with four Indian creditors who had f=
iled suit to demand the stalled Dabhol power project resume operations.=20
The Dabhol Power Co., owned by Houston-based Enron, said in a statement Thur=
sday that it had received assurances late Wednesday that the Indian governme=
nt and state lenders "intend to present new proposals at the Singapore meeti=
ng with respect to a negotiated settlement of this dispute. ..."
Enron has objected to previous attempts by some of the parties in the disput=
e to go to the courts.=20
The Dabhol Power Co. had said Wednesday it would skip the meeting to discuss=
 bids by two Indian companies to acquire a stake in the troubled dlrs 2.9 bi=
llion project in Maharashtra state.=20
That announcement was made after the state-linked Indian lenders asked the B=
ombay High Court on Wednesday to prevent Dabhol Power Co. from serving a fin=
al termination notice and winding up its operations at the 2,184 megawatt pr=
oject on Nov. 19. A preliminary notice was filed earlier this week.=20
Indian lenders, including the Industrial Finance Corp. of India., had asked =
the court to order work on the project to resume so that the lenders can rec=
over their money.=20
In May, Enron stopped construction of the 90 percent completed project - Ind=
ia's biggest ever foreign investment - and halted supply of electricity on t=
he portion already finished because the Maharashtra State Electricity Board =
said it could no longer afford the fees it agreed to pay when the contract w=
as signed seven years ago.=20
"Upon personal requests from senior representatives of the government of Ind=
ia and the Indian banks, (Dabhol) agreed to attend the meetings in Singapore=
 on Nov. 8 and 9 to discuss an amicable resolution of the Dabhol issue," the=
 company said in Thursday's statement.=20
Meanwhile, the court case was due to come up for a hearing on Friday in Bomb=
ay.=20
Indian lenders' exposure in the power project is estimated to 61 billion rup=
ees (dlrs 1.3 billion), while Enron and its partners, General Electric and B=

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- India's Dabhol Power Co. confirmed Thursday a two-da=
y meeting in Singapore between a consortium of Indian lenders and DPC offici=
als will go-ahead, despite DPC's earlier cancelation of the talks Wednesday =
prompted by a lawsuit filed by the lenders.=20
The two-day meeting, scheduled to begin in Singapore Thursday, will discuss =
bids by two Indian companies to acquire a stake in Dabhol Power Co. DPC is t=
he Indian unit of U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE).
"Under personal requests from senior representatives of the government of In=
dia and the Indian banks, DPC agreed to attend the meetings in Singapore on =
Nov. 8 and 9 to discuss an amicable resolution to the Dabhol issue," DPC's d=
irector of corporate communications Jimmy Mogal said in a statement.=20

"Late last evening (Wednesday), DPC received assurances from the government =
of India and the Indian banks that they intend to present new proposals at t=
he Singapore meeting with respect to a negotiated settlement of this dispute=
, including the purchase of foreign sponsor equity by the government of Indi=
a and the Indian banks," Mogal added.=20
As reported earlier Thursday, the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.ID=
B) - a major creditor of DPC Co. - said the Singapore meeting would go-ahead=
, although DPC officials were unable to confirm this at the time.=20
"All major Indian lenders will be present at the meeting. We are trying to f=
ind an amicable solution to this crisis," V.K. Saxena, IDBI's chief general =
manager told Dow Jones Newswires.=20
"The lenders have potential buyers like BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) and Tata Power Co.=
 Ltd. (P.TPW) who are interested in buying out Enron's stake in Dabhol Power=
 Co.," Saxena added.=20
DPC's domestic lenders include ICICI Ltd. (P.ICC), Industrial Development Ba=
nk of India (P.IDB), IFCI Ltd. (P.ICI) and State Bank of India (P.SBI).=20
Domestic lenders have provided US$1.4 billion of the project's total project=
ed cost of US$2.9 billion. IDBI's exposure is in the excess of 20 billion ru=
pees ($1=3DINR47.97), and the bank runs the risk of going deep into the red =
if this project goes bust.=20

DPC's Mogal declined to disclose the venue of the talks in Singapore "at the=
 request of the Indian financial institutions.=20
DPC Managing Director K. Wade Cline is attending the Singapore talks, Mogal =
said.=20
The Indian creditors filed a lawsuit in the Bombay High Court against DPC an=
d three other parties earlier this week to protect their interests and deman=
d that the energy project resume operations.=20
"The first hearing was initiated (Wednesday), but has been posted to Friday,=
" Mogal said although this couldn't be confirmed by the domestic lenders at =
the time of writing.=20
The DPC is embroiled in a power supply dispute with the Maharashtra state go=
vernment and over what the state government claims are "unaffordable" power =
tariffs.=20
DPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Cr=
itics object to DPC charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared =
to INR1.5 per kWh charged by other suppliers.=20
The problems with DPC have only added to Enron's much-publicized financial t=
roubles.=20
Investor confidence in the Houston-based energy company dropped after Enron =
posted a third quarter loss of US$618 million and disclosed a US$1.2 billion=
 decrease in investor equity related to partnership transactions undertaken =
with the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20

India: Enron not to move on termination till Friday

MUMBAI, Nov. 7 THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) today agreed be=
fore the Mumbai High Court not to take any steps towards termination till Fr=
iday when the court would hear arguments on a joint petition filed by the le=
nders, IDBI, ICICI, IFCI and SBI.=20
Meanwhile, a multilateral meeting scheduled to be held in Singapore on Novem=
ber 8 and 9 to sort out issues on the Dabhol project has been called off. Ac=
cording to DPC, the cancellation followed the legal action taken by Indian l=
enders.
The company stated that it would "not take any steps pursuant to the prelimi=
nary termination notices (PTN) issued on May 19 and September 10 and the ass=
et transfer notice issued on November 5 until Friday evening."=20
Mr Justice J.A. Patil has posted the petition for hearing on Friday.=20
The DPC Managing Director, Mr K. Wade Cline, in a communication to the IDBI =
Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora, and the ICICI Executive Director, Mr S. Mukherji, sa=
id the legal action by the Indian institutions was an effort to prevent DPC'=
s foreign investors from exercising their previously agreed contractual righ=
ts.=20
He said DPC was amazed at the FIs' move to file the suit when they and the C=
entre had specifically requested meetings with Enron in Singapore and Washin=
gton DC to discuss an "amicable" solution of the Dabhol issue.=20
In a sudden move yesterday, the Indian lenders - IDBI, ICICI, IFCI and State=
 Bank of India - filed a suit in the Mumbai High Court seeking a stay on ter=
mination proceedings by DPC. Mr Harish Salve, counsel for the lenders, told =
the court today that the institutions had no way to protect their security o=
ther than approach the court.=20
The lenders want the court to stay the termination process and also a direct=
ion to re-start the first phase of the project which has been mothballed fol=
lowing the spat between DPC and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).=20
Mr Salve told the court that the Indian lenders had put in more than Rs 6,00=
0 crore, either through direct lending or guarantees, into the project. The =
lenders are caught between MSEB, which has "repudiated" the power purchase a=
greement (PPA), and DPC, which is proceeding "as per the PPA".=20
On November 19, a six-month "cooling" period after the serving of the first =
PTN expires, and DPC becomes eligible to serve the final termination notice =
(FTN) as per the PPA.=20
A third-party sale of the plant would not be possible once the company serve=
s the FTN and MSEB would be obliged to take over the plant. As per the PPA, =
in such a situation, MSEB has to pay back the entire debt upfront. In the cu=
rrent circumstances, this is near-impossible, especially since MSEB would no=
t agree to the transfer of assets as it does not acknowledge the PPA.=20
FIs fear that the company would serve the FTN any time after November 19. If=
 it does, the chances of Tata Power or BSES Ltd -currently the only two cont=
enders for the project - acquiring the project may vanish.=20

In a day of dramatic developments, the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (=
DPC) initially decided against attending a meeting convened by the Indian fi=
nancial institutions in Singapore in retaliation to a case lodged against it=
 at the Bombay High Court, but subsequently, reversed its stand.=20
"The Indian government and the institutions informed us that there will be a=
 new proposal from the latter to buy Enron's equity in Dabhol Power Company,=
" said a senior official of DPC.
FI sources, though, confirmed that DPC representatives had agreed to attend =
the meeting in Singapore, but denied that they had agreed to come up with a =
new proposal to buy Enron's equity. "It is going to be a closed door meeting=
 where various issues will be discussed," they said, but declined to reveal =
further details.=20
Earlier in the day, DPC had issued a statement saying that it had called off=
 the scheduled meeting with the Indian financial institutions in Singapore o=
n Thursday and Friday following a case lodged in the Bombay High Court by th=
e latter.=20
Indian financial institutions and banks had filed a case in the High Court p=
leading for an injunction against DPC. They had asked the Court to restrain =
DPC from serving the final termination notice to the Maharashtra State Elect=
ricity Board (MSEB). Earlier this week, DPC had served a transfer of assets =
notice, thereby, setting the stage for serving the final termination notice.=
=20
Tata Power and BSES, the two companies which have evinced keen interest in b=
uying Enron's 65 per cent stake in DPC, are also slated to attend the meetin=
g. The proposals of these two companies are likely to be discussed at the me=
eting.=20
Earlier, DPC had said it was "disappointed" with the legal action taken by t=
he Indian lenders. DPC had also expressed surprise that the legal action had=
 been initiated on the eve of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to=
 the US.

Dynegy Holds Talks to Buy Enron, Inject $1.5 Billion to Shore Up Firm

11/07/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy trading and power company, was attempt=
ing to strike a deal Wednesday evening to buy Enron Corp., its beleaguered h=
ometown rival, for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, The Wall Street Journa=
l reported.=20
Because any merger of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months an=
d Enron (ENE) needs to shore up its beleaguered finances now, Dynegy (DYN) a=
lso is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people famili=
ar with the matter said.
ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to =
provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a signifi=
cant role in the negotiations. ChevronTexaco then will inject another $1 bil=
lion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake =
in Dynegy isn't substantially reduced.=20
Under the terms being worked out Wednesday night, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay=
 would have a seat on the combined company's board, but wouldn't hold any fo=
rmal management position, said the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lay =
may take on a consulting role.=20
The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron were meeting Wednesday to discuss a =
potential deal, but a seesawing Enron stock price and the complexity of a tr=
ansaction yet could derail a deal, people familiar with the matter warned.=20
Several important points, including the exchange ratio, were still being wor=
ked out, but Dynegy is expected to pay a very modest premium for Enron's sto=
ck, arguing that Enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combinin=
g the two companies.=20
Enron also is expected Thursday to disclose more financial dealings about th=
e controversial partnerships. Spokesmen from Enron and Dynegy declined to co=
mment.=20
If approved by regulators, the deal would be a stunning development for Enro=
n, which transformed itself from a staid natural-gas-pipeline company into a=
 highflying power trading giant only to see its share price -- and hefty mar=
ket valuation -- plummet in a matter of weeks.=20
Enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a promine=
nt outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms an=
d power-trading companies. The company desperately needs to win back its cre=
dibility on Wall Street following the disclosure that the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a he=
dge against fluctuating market conditions. Discussions between Dynegy and En=
ron began about 10 days ago, but intensified last weekend.=20
Should Enron strike a deal, it hopes to stabilize its stock price. Enron fel=
l 6.4%, or 62 cents, to $9.05 at 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St=
ock Exchange. At one point Wednesday morning, Enron's stock had fallen 25% o=
n news reports that Enron's efforts to line up investors had failed. The sto=
ck recovered after CNBC and Dow Jones Newswires reported the talks with Dyne=
gy. The shares are at a new 52-week low and far from the 52-week high of $84=
=2E88.=20
Dynegy fell $3, or 8.3%, to $33, at 4 p.m. in Big Board trading. However, so=
me investors believed the company's share price could benefit from the deal.=

Dynegy reportedly close to deal to buy Enron for $8 billion

11/07/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Dynegy Inc. was reportedly in the late stages of discussions =
Wednesday night with rival Enron Corp. to buy the embattled energy-trading c=
ompany for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 per share.=20
Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate $1.5 billion c=
ash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake i=
n Dynegy, the New York Times reported on its Web site, citing executives clo=
se to the discussion.
Chevron Texaco would provide an additional $1 billion injection at a later d=
ate, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume $12.8 billion in Enron de=
bt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleag=
uered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its =
current problems.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay would not be given any formal management position=
 in the combined company, although he would have a seat on its board, The Wa=
ll Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.=20
The boards of both companies were meeting late Wednesday and could announce =
the deal as early as Thursday, although the Journal reported that the transa=
ction could still be derailed.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel s=
aid the company would not respond to "rumor and speculation."=20
In Wednesday trading, Dynegy's shares were down $3 to close at $33 on the Ne=
w York Stock Exchange, while Enron's stock was off 62 cents and closed at $9=
=2E05. Shares of ChevronTexaco rose 48 cents to $87.28 on the NYSE.=20
Enron's stock is off more than 79 percent since Oct. 16, when the company sa=
id shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion, in part due to partn=
erships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
At the same time, Enron reported a $618 million third quarter loss last mont=
h, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to various =
losses. Fastow was ousted a week later.=20
The company's financial stability was further weakened after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission began an inquiry, which was upgraded to a formal inv=
estigation, of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting=
 from them.=20
Jeff Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has been called to testify be=
fore the SEC, although it remains unclear when that will occur, said Denis C=
alabrese, a spokesman for Skilling.=20
Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeove=
r of the company. Before Wednesday, companies mentioned as possible suitors =
included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.=20
Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., said a merger b=
etween Enron and Dynegy makes sense.=20
"I think Dynegy could be a very good fit in terms of understanding the merch=
ant business, having a similar culture," Grubert said. "Enron was initially =
proactive at teaming up with non-competitors but once it exhausted that rout=
e" it went in another direction.=20
In the past few weeks, Enron has cashed in about $3 billion in revolving cre=
dit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. Last week, En=
ron secured $1 billion in new financing, using some of its natural gas and p=
ipeline assets as collateral.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's Corp. on Wednesday lowered its ratings on some =
of Enron's credit linked notes and placed them on CreditWatch. S&P said Enro=
n's plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other m=
eans will be insufficient.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Inc. have also downgraded the company's =
credit ratings.=20
Last week, Enron announced it created a special committee headed by Universi=
ty of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigati=
on.=20

USA: WRAPUP 2-Enron, Dynegy in merger talks.
By Andrew Kelly

11/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Dynegy Inc. is in talks to buy troubled Enron Cor=
p. in a deal that would involve a stock swap and a $1.5 billion capital infu=
sion from ChevronTexaco, which has a big stake in Dynegy, a source close to =
the talks said on Wednesday.=20
The deal, which could be announced officially this week, was expected to giv=
e what the source called a "modest premium" to Enron shareholders, whose sto=
ck has plummeted in value as a fast-moving financial crisis enveloped the co=
mpany.
For Dynegy, the merger would catapult it to the top of the energy trading in=
dustry now dominated by Enron. Last year, the company had $29 billion in rev=
enues, compared to $100 billion for Enron.=20
For Enron, it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace for a company=
 that not long ago was ballyhooed as one of the world's most innovative, not=
 to mention profitable.=20
The source said the form of ChevronTexaco's capital infusion was not yet cle=
ar. Chevron, which recently merged with Texaco, was one of Dynegy's founding=
 investors and still owns 26.5 percent of the company.=20
STOCK HAMMERED=20
Enron has seen its stock hammered and credit ratings lowered in recent weeks=
 after reporting its first quarterly loss in four years and taking a $1.2 bi=
llion equity writedown linked to financial transactions under investigation =
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Enron shares, which traded as high as $90 in August of last year, dropped to=
 a 10-year-low of $7 during Wednesday's trading session before rallying on n=
ews of the Dynegy talks.=20
The stock ended down 62 cents at $9.05 on volume of 72.4 million shares, the=
 day's most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy stock fell $=
3 to $33.=20
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, has been =
under fire for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions conducted w=
ith partnerships run by ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. Invest=
ors said they reeked of conflict of interest and demanded a full explanation=
 they never got.=20
Fastow left the company last month in what has become a growing line of high=
-profile departures from Enron, topped by the August resignation of chief ex=
ecutive Jeff Skilling after just six months on the job.=20
The crisis has undermined confidence in Enron's financial stability, which i=
n turn has forced the company to seek cash and credit to back the energy tra=
ding operations that provide most of its revenue and earnings.=20
The New York Times said on Wednesday Enron had approached at least a dozen b=
uyout firms and investor Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.=
 ., but none took the bait.=20
Analysts have said would-be investors are wary because no one knows what fin=
ancial liabilities, if any, lurk in Enron's labyrinthine books.=20
FIRESALE=20
But Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said the firesale price for Enron =
apparently was too attractive to pass up.=20
"Certainly, Enron at $9 a share appeals to some energy companies. Dynegy app=
ears to be one of them and is looking at putting something together," he sai=
d.=20
In contrast to Dynegy, rival El Paso Corp. said on Wednesday it wanted no pa=
rt of Enron, except perhaps for a few hard assets. El Paso also said Enron w=
as perhaps neither as big or important to markets as analysts believe.=20
"If Enron goes away, which we don't think is going to happen and we hope it =
doesn't happen, we don't see the market missing a beat, frankly," Ralph Eads=
, head of El Paso's merchant energy business, told a meeting of analysts.=20
Eads said El Paso calculates that Enron accounts for about 10 percent of tra=
ding in U.S. wholesale gas and power, well below the 25 percent usually attr=
ibuted to them by analysts.=20
At least one company, Apache Corp. , said it ended some hedging agreements b=
ecause of concerns about increasing risk in the energy derivatives market ca=
used by the Enron crisis.=20
Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporte=
rs the agency was keeping an eye on the markets, watching for an Enron effec=
t.=20
"We're watching the impact that Enron or any other firm would have on the ov=
erall workings of the market, but we're not intervening where other agencies=
 have jurisdiction," he said.

Dynegy Looking to Acquire Enron
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com> and Christopher Edmonds <mailto=

Staff Reporters

Updated from 7:56 p.m.=20
Dynegy is holding talks to buy Enron in a deal that has significant backing =
from oil giant ChevronTexaco, according to media reports.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) =
would buy the embattled Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) for $7 billion =
to $8 billion in stock.=20

The Houston Chronicle and Bloomberg reported that the companies are expected=
 to announce a merger that involves cash from Chevron (CVX:NYSE - news - com=
mentary) ; Bloomberg says Chevron, which has a 27% stake in Dynegy, will add=
 $1.5 billion to the deal.=20

The deal is expected to be a stock swap at a small premium to Enron's Wednes=
day closing price of $9.05. Enron was off 7 cents in after-hours trading whi=
le Dynegy was up 34 cents, to $33.34.=20

A merger would amount to a rescue of Houston energy-trading giant Enron, who=
se stock has plunged nearly 90% in recent weeks after the company revealed t=
hat a shadowy deal caused a $1.2 billion hit to equity.=20

The controversial deal is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission and has led to the ousting of the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. =
The deluge of bad news has prompted other energy companies to reduce their d=
ealings with Enron, a serious development for a trading company.=20

Dynegy's board was meeting Wednesday afternoon to discuss the merger, while =
Enron's board was scheduled to consider the combination Wednesday evening. A=
 Dynegy spokesman declined to comment, citing a company policy of not commen=
ting on market rumors. Enron spokespersons did not return calls. Chevron dec=
lined to comment.=20

Chevron's involvement appears critical if the deal is to gain the approval o=
f rating agencies. Dynegy's balance sheet is not strong enough to acquire En=
ron on its own. Therefore, Chevron is expected to raise its stake in Dynegy =
and possibly make an immediate cash infusion into Enron. The size of any inf=
usions will be a good indication of how bad things have gotten at Enron.=20

With the stock plummeting and Enron facing a mounting debt crisis -- $12 bil=
lion in direct debt and nearly $9 billion in potential liabilities from affi=
liates -- the company is running out of options. It recently drew down about=
 $3 billion in existing credit lines and gained an additional $1 billion in =
credit secured by its pipeline business. Enron debt has been downgraded in r=
ecent days by the three main credit-rating agencies.=20

Sources say a number of potential investors have been approached -- from War=
ren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK^A:NYSE - news - commentary) to Royal D=
utch/Shell (RD:NYSE ADR - news - commentary) -- with little success.=20

General Electric's (GE:NYSE - news - commentary) capital division is said to=
 have held multiple talks with Enron with no resolution.=20
Dynegy may be motivated by its significant exposure to Enron. If Enron had f=
ailed, Dynegy could have faced serious disruption and large losses because t=
he two firms are trading partners on a number of contracts. In such a relati=
onship, Dynegy could have contracts to purchase a commodity like power or na=
tural gas from Enron and be committed to sell that commodity to another buye=
r. If Enron failed to deliver, the domino effect could have a significant ec=
onomic impact on Dynegy. While other energy trading firms have exposure, sou=
rces speculate Dynegy's exposure is more significant than its peers.=20
Enron was down as much as 20% during the day. Dynegy stock was off 8% in the=
 regular session, while its bonds also skidded on rumors of a deal.=20
