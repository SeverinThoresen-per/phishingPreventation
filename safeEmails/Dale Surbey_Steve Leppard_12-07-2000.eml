Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a=20
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to=
=20
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with=
=20
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant=20
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and=20
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not=20
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token=20
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for=20
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to=
=20
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy=20
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at=20
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greate=
r=20
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr)=20
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of=20
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed. =20
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer=
=20
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually=
=20
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale
