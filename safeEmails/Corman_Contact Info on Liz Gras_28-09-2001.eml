Suzanne,
=20
Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and emai=
l.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process =
and her thoughts about travel plans.
=20
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together f=
or court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made=
 progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the=
 Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I wa=
nt to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the go=
al line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form re=
alistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Li=
z will be helpful on this front.
=20
Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below =
you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably s=
ometime next week?
=20
I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I=
 am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be t=
aking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me =
tomorrow.

Shelley,
=20
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is =
good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is proba=
bly going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this =
taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.

Sorry for the delay.=20

Dear Suzanne,=20
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please=20
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite=20
102,=20
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in=20
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital=20
section.=20
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned=20
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is=20
the=20
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to=20
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is=20
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that=20
"the=20
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would=20
be=20
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian=20
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a=20
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan.=20
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any=20
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to=20
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a=20
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends=20
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything=20
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me.=20
Chris=20
