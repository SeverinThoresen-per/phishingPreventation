Chris,

I'm sorry for the delay, but we are trying to be very careful about who has =
access to all the information and data on the website.  We have requested a =
list from HR of everyone who has signed the UBS agreement, but we still don'=
t have the list for Portland or Calgary.  We made the request again this mor=
ning, but still haven't received the list.  I will update the access as soon=
 as I get the list - sorry again for the delay.

Chris
