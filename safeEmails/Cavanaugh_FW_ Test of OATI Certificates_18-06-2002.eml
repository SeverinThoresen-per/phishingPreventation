Subject: Test of OATI Certificates


On Wednesday, June 19, at 1000 MDT (0900 PDT) we will test the EHV web=20
site server's ability to utilize OATI digital certificates.  This will requi=
re moving=20
to the backup server for about an hour.  While on the backup, access to the=20
site will not be available through Tradewave.  After the test, we will switc=
h=20
back to Tradewave.

We'd like as many people as possible to participate in this test.  To=20
participate, you must have an OATI digital certificate.  If you do not yet h=
ave=20
an OATI certificate and are ready to get one, please send a message to me=20
and I'll let OATI know.  It will take 2-3 days to obtain and install a certi=
ficate.

Please let me know today if you plan to participate in the test.  Following =
the=20
test, I'll be requesting information from you as to how successful you were =
in=20
accessing the site.

As I have announced before, after June 30, the access through Tradewave=20
will no longer be available.
