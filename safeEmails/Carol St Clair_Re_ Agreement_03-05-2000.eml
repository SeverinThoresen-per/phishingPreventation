Susan:
I am okay with these changes so long as we make clear to them that by=20
agreeing to take out arbitration we are not setting a precedent with them=20
with respect to any future agreements (i.e., ISDA Master etc.) that we inten=
d=20
to enter into with them.  Please let me see the agreement as I think that if=
=20
we go back to our non-arbitration language, there is other language that=20
needs to be added.
Carol
