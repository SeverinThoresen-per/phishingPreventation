The U.S. rejection of the Kyoto Protocol appears to give U.S. companies an=20

U.S. multinationals seem resigned to the fact that their operations abroad=20

=20
voluntary agreement to cut 25% from 1995 levels of the amount of carbon=20

The Kyoto agreement, approved this week by 178 countries, but not by the=20

Foreign companies are hollering that they will have to abide by stiffer=20

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission appears headed for a=20
showdown with Gov. Gray Davis, perhaps as early as today, over political=20
control of the powerful nonprofit corporation that runs California's=20
electricity transmission grid.=20
Responding to an industry complaint that the grid operator lacks required=20
independence, FERC could immediately disband its governing board, which was=20
appointed by Davis. But several observers said Tuesday that such a=20
politically provocative step seems unlikely in the heat of summer. They=20
predicted the commission will find some other way, such as negotiations with=
=20
Davis, to address its concerns.
Most consumers know the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO,=20
as the agency that declares power emergencies and schedules rolling=20
blackouts.=20
But the Folsom-based ISO is more than that: It functions as California's=20
electricity traffic controller, scheduling delivery of power to match=20
shifting demand throughout a service area that covers three-quarters of the=20
state. It is the fifth-largest entity of its kind in the world.=20
Under emergency legislation passed in Sacramento earlier this year, Cal-ISO=20
is now governed by a five-member board appointed by Davis, and there lies th=
e=20
controversy.=20
Power companies have formally complained to FERC that Cal-ISO can no longer=20
be considered an unbiased player in the market, as federal rules require it=20
to be. They point out that the state, through the Department of Water=20
Resources, is now a major power buyer.=20
The industry fears that Davis might one day use his leverage over Cal-ISO to=
=20
deny access to the California market to sellers that fall from political=20
grace or don't deal with the water department on favorable terms.=20
Senior FERC officials agree that a conflict of interest exists. Previously,=20
Cal-ISO was governed by a board that represented a cross-section of interest=
=20
groups from industry to consumers. But that arrangement was widely considere=
d=20
ineffective.=20
The issue is scheduled for consideration today at FERC's last meeting of the=
=20
summer. Agency sources said FERC's five commissioners are considering a wide=
=20
range of options, from ordering the current ISO board disbanded to postponin=
g=20
a decision altogether.=20
New Board Could Be One Compromise=20
One middle-of-the-road proposal calls for negotiations and arbitration with=20
Davis and other interested parties, with the goal of creating a new Cal-ISO=20
governing board not directly answerable to the governor.=20
"The ISO is not independent," said a senior FERC official who asked not to b=
e=20
identified. "There is ample evidence of that. The governor should not be=20
appointing the board.=20
"We believe the law is on our side," the official added. "But having the law=
=20
on your side may mean sending federal marshals. To some extent, this has the=
=20
flavor of a government takeover. Do you kick the doors in and install a new=20
board?"=20
Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer appointed by Davis to head the Cal-ISO=20
board, indicated the state would be willing to negotiate.=20
"Precipitous intervention is not warranted," Kahn said. "We should try to=20
initiate some sort of dialogue to see if this can be resolved otherwise."=20
Added Kahn: "The generators and the marketers don't like the ISO because it=20
is independent of their interests."=20
In a legal brief submitted to FERC in May, the industry declared that it has=
=20
no confidence in the current setup and warned that doubts about Cal-ISO coul=
d=20
crimp needed investment in new power plants.=20
"The establishment of an independent [Cal-ISO] is vital to the long-term=20
resolution of California's energy problems and the stability of the entire=20
Western region," wrote Julie Simon, vice president for policy at the Electri=
c=20
Power Supply Assn. "The continued influx of capital for new or expanded=20
in-state generation, the willingness . . . of out-of-state suppliers to sell=
=20
into the California market and the ability to seamlessly integrate=20
California's grid with other Western regional transmission organizations wil=
l=20
require that [Cal-ISO] function as an 'honest broker.' "=20
But Cal-ISO, she added, "has been transformed from an independent operator o=
f=20
interstate transmission resources to a partisan advocate for the state of=20
California. . . . If the governor is dissatisfied with the [Cal-ISO] board,=20
he can appoint a new board."=20
Consumer advocates say that presents a problem for power marketers such as=20
Mirant Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Corp. and Enron Corp., but not for=20
the public.=20
Differing Views on Panel's Role=20
"The ISO is finally operating in the public interest, and it drives these=20
companies nuts," said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America.=20
"FERC has continually complained that California is supposed to fix its own=20
problem. There is an ISO that appears to be working. So why would anybody=20
want to go and stir this up?"=20
However, Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) said the close link between the grid=20
operator and Davis has hurt California's credibility in the energy policy=20
debate.=20
"The purpose of that board is to run the transmission grid," Ose said. "You=20
can have a consumer representative, but you've got to have people who have=20
significantly greater experience running electric transmission."=20
Kahn, the Cal-ISO chairman, said the board has not tried to put itself in th=
e=20
place of the professional staff running the grid. "ISO management has been=20
allowed to do what they want. There has been very, very limited interference=
=20
by the board. If FERC now wants to come in and micromanage the ISO, that=20
would be extraordinary."=20
A veteran Washington energy lawyer said he doubts that FERC will take such a=
=20
drastic step as dismissing the board appointed by Davis. Although the agency=
=20
appears to have the legal authority to do so, since federal law supersedes=20
state law, such a move would likely trigger a rhetorical backlash from Davis=
=20
and a lawsuit by the state.=20
"It is a red-hot issue, and this is the summer peak," said the lawyer, who=20
asked not to be identified. "You can make a pretty good argument that the=20
commission ought to take a crack at negotiating a way out of this."=20
Tension between FERC and Davis is likely to continue for months and spill=20
into other areas. For example, FERC wants the California grid to eventually=20
form part of a regional transmission network governed by a board that=20
represents the entire West. The governor wants the California grid to remain=
=20
under state control.=20

Dynegy reported a 60 percent jump in net second-quarter income Tuesday,=20
fueled by strong power and natural gas sales.=20
Investors, however, reacted by lumping Dynegy in with energy stocks that too=
k=20
a pounding in the day's trading.
Dynegy's quarterly net income rose to $146 million, up from $91 million a=20

cents.=20
The year-ago earnings per share rose to 29 cents after excluding a special=20

"I couldn't be happier with the way the core business is operating today,"=20
Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief executive and chairman, said during a conferenc=
e=20
call with analysts.=20
Dynegy beat analyst expectations. Those surveyed by Thomson Financial/First=20
Call projected Dynegy would make an average of 40 cents a diluted share.=20
But investors drove Dynegy's stock down. It closed at $43, off $2.75.=20
Other Houston energy companies got hit, including fellow trader Enron Corp.,=
=20
which closed down $3.42 at $43.24; natural-gas company El Paso Corp., which=20
closed down $4.26 at $47.64; and Reliant Energy's Reliant Resources unit,=20
which closed down $2.25 at $18.35.=20
Parent Reliant Energy only got nicked, closing at $28, down 37 cents.=20
The overall stock market had a down day, with the Dow closing off more than=20
180 points amid negative news from other corporate sectors.=20
Analysts offered several reasons for the energy sell-off, including concerns=
=20
over how California's energy conflicts will play out.=20
Energy companies and California failed to settle the state's claims that it=20
is owed billions for alleged power overcharges. The matter rests with the=20
Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, which may take up the issue today.=20
Also, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles on Tuesday downgraded a=20
number of energy stocks, although he remained positive on Enron and Dynegy.=20
Companies mostly or solely focused on electricity generation face more risks=
=20
when power prices decline, as has been the case recently. Dynegy and Enron=20
don't fit that profile.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company International in Houston,=20
described Dynegy's quarter as a solid one that "proves that they can make=20
money even when gas and power prices are falling." He added: "From my=20
perspective, Dynegy is in great shape for the second half of this year."=20
The market failed to distinguish between power producers and so-called energ=
y=20
merchants such as Dynegy, said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential=20
Securities in Houston.=20
"I guess the big signal is that strong earnings performance doesn't seem to=20
matter in this market here," she said. "The whole message is that strong=20
earnings have very little impact on the sector right now."=20
The sell-off in the face of good earnings left officials at Dynegy=20
frustrated, said Chief Financial Officer Rob Doty, who was expecting the=20
market to be excited by the company's second-quarter performance.=20
Net income for Dynegy's marketing and trading unit rose 111 percent to $150=20

natural gas and electricity sales in North America increased significantly.=20
Dynegy's online trading operation, Dynegydirect, helped boost those volumes=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) telecommunications unit reported a=
=20
$20 million loss in the second quarter of this year, executives said Tuesday=
=2E=20
During the first six months of the year, Dynegy Global Communications lost a=
=20
total of $31 million.=20
In a conference call, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said=20
losses in the second half of the year aren't expected to exceed those of the=
=20
first half. For the year, telecom losses are expected to bring down corporat=
e=20
earnings per share by 13 cents to 16 cents.
"There's been an obvious turndown since Dynegy entered in the market last=20
summer," Watson said. "We can't make a profit until our network is=20
completed."=20
Company officials attributed the loss to the cost of building Dynegy's globa=
l=20
telecommunications network.=20
But Watson said the company was in a better position than some of its energy=
=20
merchant competitors.=20
"We didn't beef up our personnel and assets, so we don't find ourselves in=20
the same position as others," he said.=20
The company has taken some steps to reduce its costs, however.=20
The global communications office in Vienna has been closed and its personnel=
=20
and operations have been moved to the unit's London office.=20
"We're keeping our head count flat," Watson said of the unit as a whole.=20
Company executives were patting themselves on the back throughout the=20
conference call for the strategy they followed, which is playing well in the=
=20
depressed telecommunications market.=20
Pat Marburger, president of Dynegy Broadband Trading and Origination, told=20
Dow Jones Newswires that the strategy was intended to reduce the company's=20
capital investment.=20
"We knew getting into it we wanted to invest very little capital, which=20
should give us a cost advantage right out of the chute," Marburger said.=20
As in energy, the company has emphasized alliances with other companies=20
instead of going it alone.=20
For example, earlier this year, Dynegy announced an agreement with Telseon=20
Inc. to use that company's points of presence in 18 of the largest U.S.=20
cities. "We could have done the same thing with $15 million over 18 months=20
time," he said.=20
He also said a $70 million investment in indefeasible rights of use for unli=
t=20
optical fiber from Level 3 was a good investment, even though the cost of=20
dark fiber has dropped along with bandwidth prices.=20
Although Dynegy has kept its broadband marketing and trading staff small,=20
both Watson and Marburger promised they'll have the people needed to handle=20
the bandwidth market.=20
About 30 people market bandwidth from the Denver office. And another group o=
f=20
less than 10 people trades bandwidth, Marburger said. Most of those trades=20
are for infrastructure, he added.=20
Marburger expects the marketing group to grow to 50-60 people by the middle=20
or end of next year. He also expects the bandwidth market to recover within=20
two years.=20
The entire telecom unit employs about 300 people.=20
The company doesn't expect to reassign employees once the network is complet=
e=20
at the end of this year, Marburger said. Enron Broadband Services (ENE)=20
reassigned employees and Williams Communications (WCG) laid off employees=20
after their networks were completed.=20
"Most of the network is being outsourced," he said.=20
A telecommunications industry analyst said the energy merchants were about=20
the only companies left that can invest in telecommunications.=20
"I think these upfront costs are going to result in some losses," said Rod=20
Woodward of Frost & Sullivan in San Antonio, Texas. "They're able to support=
=20
those losses with the way they are doing with their energy groups."=20
Overall, Dynegy Inc. reported net income of $142 million on operating revenu=
e=20
of $10.8 billion for the second quarter of 2001, or recurring earnings of 43=
=20
cents per share.=20
In the second quarter of last year, the company reported net income of $91=20
million on operating revenue of $5.7 billion, or recurring earnings of 19=20
cents per diluted share.=20

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Bandwidth Trading Isn't Dead Yet
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An official with one of the largest telecommunications=
=20
carriers laughed last week, saying Enron Corp. (ENE) had been chased out of=20
the broadband business by a $102 million loss for the second quarter.=20
His laughter was probably premature. Enron is cutting expenses in its=20
broadband operation, but so is just about every other company involved in=20
that business, including the official's own employer.
At the same time, there are signs that energy companies haven't given up on=20
bandwidth trading.=20
For one, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Aquila Energy Services (ILA), Koch Industries, E=
l=20
Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),=20
Cable & Wireless PLC (CWP) and Global Crossing Ltd. (GX) have quietly formed=
=20
a consortium to work at improving connectivity needed for bandwidth trading.=
=20
Sources at those companies wouldn't confirm they were members of a=20
consortium. They've agreed to keep their work quiet. But other sources said=20
the group has had at least one meeting.=20
Companies like Sphera Optical Networks Inc., FiberNet Telecom Group (FTGX),=20
Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), LighTrade and Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) were=20
invited to the meeting to talk about what they could do to help firm=20
deliveries of bandwidth.=20
Tier-1 carriers - the largest carriers - were excluded, as consortium member=
s=20
want to make it easier to trade in their markets, a broker said.=20
Creating Commodities=20

There's another sign that bandwidth trading isn't dead.=20
Steve Kamman, an equity analyst for CIBC World Markets, said in a research=20
note last week that carriers have started reselling backup circuits to third=
=20
parties, who buy them as unprotected circuits at big discounts.=20
"We've bought lines like that," said Sushil Nelson, general manager of Aquil=
a=20
Broadband Services, the telecom unit of Aquila Energy Services (ILA). "We do=
=20
it with the carriers all the time."=20
Fully protected circuits - called Sonet rings - consist of two circuits=20
running between two cities. One circuit carries data, while the other serves=
=20
as a backup. Since the backup isn't used, it can be resold - as long as the=20
new buyer will accept the risk of getting bumped.=20
Many buyers don't need the full protection of a Sonet ring. Internet service=
=20
providers and many data users aren't providing critical services, so they ca=
n=20
put up with some outages, especially if it means lower prices.=20
Unprotected circuits became a standard offering on international subsea=20
routes this spring, when four large carriers began to offer them in response=
=20
to demand from customers. An official for one of those carriers said his=20
company started breaking up Sonet rings and selling unprotected circuits on=20
transatlantic routes early last year.=20
Selling the other half of a Sonet ring is a step toward commoditization of=20
capacity, Nelson said.=20
Buyers can build their own lower-priced Sonet rings, Kamman said. For=20
example, if a buyer wanted a protected circuit from New York to Los Angeles,=
=20
he could buy one unprotected circuit between the two cities, running through=
=20
Chicago. Because it's unprotected, the buyer gets it at less than half the=20
price of a protected circuit.=20
Then he buys another unprotected circuit between New York and Los Angeles,=20
running though Dallas. Again, he gets a discount. The two unprotected=20
circuits give him almost the same protection of a Sonet ring, but at a lower=
=20
cost. If he gets bumped off one, he can switch to the other.=20
Alternatively, the buyer can pick up some added revenue by reselling the=20
unprotected circuit he isn't using.=20
Taking Advantage Of Options=20

Such deals take advantage of options embedded in a network, Kamman said.=20
Buyers are taking the risk that they'll get bumped in exchange for a lower=20
price.=20
Such sales are good for the carriers. They've already paid the cost of layin=
g=20
and lighting Sonet ring circuits. If they sell only Sonet rings, half their=20
circuits go unused. Now they can earn new revenue by selling the unused half=
=2E=20
Bandwidth trading opens eyes to new ways of doing business in telecom, Kamma=
n=20
said.=20
"It's incredibly cool," he said. "Squeezing (the optionality) out of the=20
networks and turning it into a traded security is going to take some real=20
work. But there's no question at all that (it's) something very real."=20
