Would one of you like to discuss Board reporting categories of core vs. unde=
r review w/Whalley?  Then advise us as to whether the only commodity groups =
to be considered core are:

European Gas
UK Power
Continental Power
North American Gas
North American Power
Coal

My understanding per the general guidance of the analyst call earlier this w=
eek.

Cassandra.

Cassandra - This is a great idea.  Pls. confirm that Rick is comfortable, an=
d I think it makes sense to run it past Whalley.  If this is a matter of sor=
ting, then I would run it past Greg soon - he is the only one who knows how =
clear these distinctions are at this time.  If this is a very labor-intensiv=
e effort, pls. advise.  Thanks.  Paula

Paula-

I hear on the analyst call this morning that we're segregating our wholesale=
 business into 3 categories 1) core, 2) non-core, and 3) under review.

I believe # 1 and # 3 both impact trading; accordingly, perhaps we should cu=
stomize our reporting accordingly.  Can you review the list below (an excerp=
t from Appendix 1 of the Risk Management Policy) and advise as to which cate=
gory each commodity group fits?  Alternatively we can confirm directly with =
Whalley.  My understanding was this would be a subject of discussion at the =
Board meeting, and consequently it might help everyone to be able to see the=
 trading results aggregated that way.

Of course if you prefer not reporting to the Board in these new business cat=
egories, please advise. =20

Thank you,

Cassandra.
