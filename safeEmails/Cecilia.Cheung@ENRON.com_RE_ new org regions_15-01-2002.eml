Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book =
is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, U=
nleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities=
 could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 bo=
ok set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Cecilia
