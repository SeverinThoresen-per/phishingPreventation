Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets=

s is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case=

Thanks,

In additon to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you menti=
oned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage=
 of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be wit=
h AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on th=
e Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease valu=
e of 188,371,296 should not be needed. =20

Jackie
Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

Jim:
As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete t=
he Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the i=
nsurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to =
receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not=
 been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divest=
itures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful=
 in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.=20

Regards,
