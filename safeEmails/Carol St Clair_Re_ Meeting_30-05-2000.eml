David:

I don't want to meet until the report with all of the categories has been =20
completed.  Just let me know when that is.  Again, the categories are as=20
follows:
 -  # of unsigned confirms
 - total exposure of deals whose confirms have not been executed
 - # of deals with unsigned confirms whose term is in excess of 1 year
 - has the counterparty ever signed confirms?
 - reason for not signing confirms
