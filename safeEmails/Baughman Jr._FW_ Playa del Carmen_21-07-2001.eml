Hola cabrones,
Ok, aqui esta el plan! Due to some very important people dragging their bums=
 things have changed slighty. We will now be going to Playa del Carmen. Many=
 of us have been there before. It is a great place and well situated. The ho=
tel is called the Rui Playa and the price is $585.00 smackeroos all inclusiv=
e. It is a fun jet package I found through Way to Go Travel agency here in t=
own. It is a very nice place and I urge everyone going to look at the funjet=
 travel site and check it out. There is two people to a room and we can work=
 out when we get down there who's bunking with whom. Again the dates are lea=
ving Thursday September 6th returning Sunday the 9th.  Please call Elizabeth=
 at Wat to Go Travel at 713-467-2262 and work out paying. They can either se=
nd you the ticket or you can pick it up. Don and I have already reserved our=
 places and I have left a list of those that have confirmed to me with Eliza=
beth. They are as follows. My! cell phone is 281-450-6115 please call me for=
 anything. If I left anyone out please inform me all we need to do is give h=
er the names. For those of you who may have to cancel I suggest buying the t=
icket insurance it's only $35. Please do this asap because sure as shit the =
prices just like morning wood will rise again. =20
