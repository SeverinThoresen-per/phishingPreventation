Guzman,

Willamette enpower deals were still entered in incorrectly for 12/20, and=20
made it through the SAR that way.  I fixed them this morning.=20

Concerning IPC, I cannot tell from your email if you spoke with IPC or what=20
resolution you arrived at.  If EPMI is found to be responsible and you are=20
unable to resolve the issue, you need to draft a letter to me with all the=20
appropriate information concerning the trade.   I will then explain the=20
discrepancy to EPE.  Please get me the complete information as quickly as=20
possible.

Thank you,

Bill
