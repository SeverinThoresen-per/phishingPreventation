Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last=20
item or not.  Thanks.

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on=20
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a=20
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing=20
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if=20
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we=20
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding=20
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that i=
n=20
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian=20
issues as well.

I agree.  One little comment.  Though the transactional legal work should=20
remain in Argentina, as an exemption, I would suggest to use Brazilian=20
resources for "project financeable" gas supply agreements.

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in=20
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas=
=20
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural ga=
s=20
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved=20
Gaby over to support the effort.=20

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercia=
l=20
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I=20
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to Joh=
n=20
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and=20
purchases) remain in Argentina.=20

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise=
=20
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the=20
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be=20
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts.=20
