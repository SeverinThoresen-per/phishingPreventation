Hey, got your voicemail.  Sorry I didn't email you sooner.  Funny what you s=
aid in the voicemail, cause tomorrow is actually my last day at Enron.  I ju=
st gave my notice last Monday.  I'm going to be doing some accounting and ta=
x work (reporting, not compliance) for a Fortune 100 energy company (can't t=
ell you from this email address) in downtown Houston.  In the Fall, I'll pro=
bably go at night and work on an MBA, since I got the CPA out of the way.  M=
y thinking is that I can eventually move out of accounting and do some finan=
cial stuff.  If it don't work out, I can always call Henry and Aziz back.

If I don't see you before I leave, let's definitely keep in touch.  My perso=
nal email address is huxen@huxen.com <mailto:huxen@huxen.com> (yep, that's r=
eal... coming up with a website too as soon as I think of an idea).
=20
Let me give you my phone info as well.  What part of town you staying at?
