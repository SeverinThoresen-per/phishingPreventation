Hi Paul,
?
Thanks for the e-mail. Sorry I missed your calls  this morning but I was at=20
the dentist, where its difficult to speak at the best  of times!
?
I'm sorry but it doesn't look like we will be able  to commit to?the EPRM Va=
R=20
conference. We are still a small company and the  trip would tie us up for=20
over a week. I'm sure you'll understand that internally  we just can't=20
justify?the two senior members of the company?to be away  on EPRM business=20
and to have to pay money from our own pocket?to run this  course for you. It=
=20
was a difficult decision originally to?offer our  services at expenses only=20
with no fee, but we did so for the potential  opportunity to work some more=20
with Vince.
?
Good luck in your search for alternative course  leaders.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.

Hi  Chris,
?
Just  an extra note regarding the course. If the reimbursements are suitable=
=20
I would  like to finalise the line-up ASAP (Vince and a European Enron=20
representative).  If you were unable to participate I would need to offer=20
alternative  invitations by the end of this week.

All  the best,

Hi  Chris,
?
I've  been looking at the forward plan and the total budget for speaker=20
expenses is  5500 pounds (US keyboard, no pound sign). At current exchange=20
rates this comes  to a little over 15,000 Australian dollars. I would be=20
happy to cover your  expenses up to this figure.
?
The  course is scheduled to run in Amsterdam (not London as originally=20
planned) and  Houston. The dates are slightly flexible?to?work with your=20
travel  schedules. For instance, would you prefer to travel to =20
Sydney-Houston-Amsterdam-Sydney, or in the opposite  direction?
?
If  you could contact me to?let me know if this would?enable you to  commit=20
to the course, I would be delighted to forward the notes from the  research.=
=20
I would plan to then work on the outline until March  1st.I look forward to=20
speaking with you  soon.
?
Best  wishes,

Bit of a busy morning here - I'll be out for  about 1.5 hrs (9.15 Sydney=20

Hi Chris,
?
I would like to confirm the dates of some of the  forthcoming EPRM events:
?
Effective VaR and stress testing  techniques for the US energy industry. Thi=
s=20
event will run on the  21 & 22 May in London and the 28 & 29 May in Houston.=
=20
Michele Du  Berry (Director of Conferences) and I are looking at how we have=
 =20
structured the training courses and are keen to present a different  outline=
=20
than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2-3  trainers=20
per venue, rather than with 7-8 as we have done in the past. If  you and Les=
=20
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible  with Vince=20
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater  detail.
?
Energy & Power Risk Management,  Europe. Our largest annual European event i=
s=20
scheduled to between  September 19-21. Victoria Kerridge will be producing=20
this event from the  London office and will be starting research in two=20
weeks. I am going to be  providing her with a brief and will ensure that she=
=20
has your contact  details.
?
I have also been finalizing the details for the  annual Energy & Power Risk=20
Management event in Houston. This will take  place on May 14th & 15th and is=
=20
close to completion. I would be happy  to provide you with more details,=20
without potentially running the risk of  overloading your schedule with a=20
number of events in a short space of time  (VaR and EPRM, Houston). My=20
priority is to secure trainers for our VaR  course.
?
If you would be interested in any of the events  listed, I would be happy to=
=20
talk with you this week. My direct line is 212  925 6990, extension 225.=20
?
Best wishes,

Hi Paul,
?
Just a note so that you have my address. Do  you have dates for the US and=20
European conferences yet? I'm sure that we  can arrange other work at the=20
same time to offset the expenses of  speaking at these events if you want us=
=20
to participate.
?
You also mentioned a training course on VaR  and the energy area. We had an=20
EPRM article last year with Vince on a  comparison of the different=20
techniques on a trial portfolio that might  form the basis of something=20
useful. Anyway, let me know.

Best regards.

Chris.
