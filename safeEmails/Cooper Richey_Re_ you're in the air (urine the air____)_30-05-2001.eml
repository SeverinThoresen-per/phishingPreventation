hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I=
 planned to=20
write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it=
=2E

i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long=
 time and
it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to t=
he=20
reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to=
 go back
- just a logistical pain in the ass. =20

thanks for thinking of me.

it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because th=
e summer
is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people =
and i think i'm=20
probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't=
 enjoy the office
culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering tha=
t i spend
alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate. =20

have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with t=
he choice
of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners=
 than great
works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with ne=
w york and also
served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and th=
en write a book
about the wild and crazy life backstage. =20

coo-per

ok, first you made an appearance in my dream.
then i talked to KT last night (for the first time in, oh, four
months...), and she was telling me about daniella's wedding, and
hanging out with the likes of you.
so i was compelled to say hello.
she says you work hard, and play not enough.
which sounds not as much fun, but more practical, than playing hard and
not working enough.

i neither play hard NOR work hard.  what a disaster.

how are you?
i hope you're doing well.  i hope you're enjoying Calgary (!!).
new york is good.  now that it's warm, i feel sane.  able to walk
places and play frisbee.  the great thing about the east coast, as you
may recall, is that spring and summer feel like a reward for a job
well-done.  or done anyway.

that's it, that's all i've got.
but i was thinking of you, and wanted to say hi.
