I need help on this one.  I spoke to Gary shortly after he sent this e-mail =
the other day.  I wasn't sure what to say in the letter regarding how long t=
hey would be shut in -- Is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy=
 the situation?  Are we ever going to take the gas again?  Should I tell the=
m that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?

At Gary's suggestion, I called Mike Morris & left a message, but haven't hea=
rd back from him.  Therefore, I am sending this e-mail to see if anyone else=
 can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I n=
eed to send out.

Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.
