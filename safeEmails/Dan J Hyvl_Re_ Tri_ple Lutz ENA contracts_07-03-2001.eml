Sandi,
 As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I=20
believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts=20
that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put i=
n=20
place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also=20
wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA=20
wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not thin=
k=20
that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There ar=
e=20
certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company,=
=20
these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also=20
wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably nee=
d=20
a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

Dan,
I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well a=
s=20
those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco=
=2E=20
Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also,=
=20
is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather=
=20
than Lodisco? Let me know--

Thanks,
Sandi
