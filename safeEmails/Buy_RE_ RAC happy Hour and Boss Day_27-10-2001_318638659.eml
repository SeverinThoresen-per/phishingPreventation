Rick,

This email was supposed to be delivered the week after the Happy Hour. Somet=
hing went wrong and it never got delivered. I still want you and Karen to re=
ad it.=20

Rick,

Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week. As always these event=
s help us to break the silos in which we tend to work some=20
times. In this occasion I made two new friends and had the opportunity to di=
scuss business maters with the people that work in Rick Carson group. After =
finishing the 3-Quarter revaluation process, I feel that Underwriting and Du=
e Diligence can work much more closer, shearing information and experiences =
from the Due diligence site visits. =20

Happy boss day=20
