Rod:
The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equit=
y=20
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in=20
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make i=
t=20
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a=20
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a=20
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we=
=20
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank=20
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option=20
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation=20
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event=20
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured"=20
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that=20
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method=20
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appear=
s=20
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would=20
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them=20
about this next week.
