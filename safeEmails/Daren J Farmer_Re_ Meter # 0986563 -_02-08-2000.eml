If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the=20
correct person.

For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for=20
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volum=
e=20
management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the=20
volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know. =20

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
