Gina, each assistant does time sheets.  So I believe Alma Green would be the=
 person that supports you.
Cost centers is Donna's responsibility to work with us.  She has been real g=
ood about researching information
for us.  Just let her know what you need.  I may go ahead and have a Primary=
 and Secondary for Time
Sheet questions and we can discuss on Wed.  Thanks Lynn
