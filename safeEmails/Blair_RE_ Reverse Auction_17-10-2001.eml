	I think it would be very prudent to put something on the WEB.  We talked ab=
out this at the
	Winter Ops meeting and it would be good to have another reminder.

	John, would you work with Michelle and Bill to get a posting on the WEB sin=
ce I will be
	out of town.  Thanks. Lynn

Michele,
I just found a note that I had written to myself about posting on the web si=
te a notice to remind the Reverse Auction shippers that effective Nov. 1, th=
ey wouldn't be able to nominate to the Reverse Auction point anymore.  It ma=
y be worth it to check with Bill Fowler and/or Lynn Blair to see if they thi=
nk this would be beneficial.  Do you want to follow up on this?
Ranelle =20
