Hi Sally,

My name is Luis Bravo, we met about a month ago in an Associates happy hour =
(I'm the intern who was trying -without success- to meet with you last summe=
r), right now I am an Associate at EES, structuring businesses.=20

First of all thanks for inviting us (Associates) to join your meeting. It wa=
s a very illustrative as well as an entertaining one -nice video by the way.=
=20

I am writing you because I am very interested in getting to know more about =
the Risk Management operations at Enron Networks so it would be ideal for me=
 to meet with you to talk about it; however, if not possible in the mean tim=
e, I would also appreciate if you could give me some names of people that I =
could contact to so that I can get acquainted of this side of Enron Networks=
 operations.

Thanks a lot,=20

Regards,

Luis Bravo
