"Reasonable" works for me - my interpretation is what Enron has done in the =
past (and many other companies do) including but not limited to the followin=
g:

- actual moving and related costs=20
- sales commission on house
- a couple of moving trips
- temp housing for a month or two
- coverage on appraised value of house if can not sell quickly
- gross up to cover taxes, where appropriate

- Not looking to gain, just to remain whole

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will hav=
e arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken to=
o has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any=
 obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an =
agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all "reasonable" costs.
