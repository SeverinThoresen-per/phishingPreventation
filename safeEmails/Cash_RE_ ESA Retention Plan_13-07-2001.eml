Noel, here are my suggested revisions:


In order to represent an incentive for the Beneficiary to remain in the Comp=
any, the Beneficiary will be vested in the right to exercise an option as fo=
llows: (a) up to 15% of the stock options granted on the granting date; (b) =
up to 30% of the stock options granted as of six (6) months following the gr=
anting date; (c) up to 45% of the stock options granted as of twelve (12) mo=
nths following the granting date; (d) up to 60% of the stock options granted=
 as of eighteen (18) months following the granting date; (e) up to 75% of th=
e stock options granted as of twenty-four (24) months following the granting=
 date; (f) up to 90% of the stock options granted as of thirty (30) months f=
ollowing the granting date; and (g) up to 100% of the stock options granted =
as of thirty-six (36) months following the granting date.  The right of the =
Beneficiary to the stock option will only be available once vested.  The Ben=
eficiary may exercise vested options within the validity period of five (5) =
years from date of grant.  In no event may Beneficiary exercise or have any =
rights to unvested options. In no event may Beneficiary exercise or have any=
 rights in a stock option after the term of the validity period expires.

Pam

The ESA lawyers sent us a draft of the "evergreen agreement" that the employ=
ees are going to sign before they receive options and base salary increases.=
  Could you make sure the wording for the vesting schedule (highlighted in y=
ellow) is acceptable.
