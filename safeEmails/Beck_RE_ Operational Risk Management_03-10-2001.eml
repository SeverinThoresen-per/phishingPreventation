Rick: =20

Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk.  =
We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involved =
in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives=
=2E  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.  =
Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's bus=
inesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or is t=
here an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to=
 have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complementi=
ng, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's int=
ernal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being piloted i=
n London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA audits, =
Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the various ope=
rations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other Thursda=
y with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate represen=
tatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cover this in=
 a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibiliti=
es at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quanti=
fying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impleme=
ntation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit lev=
els.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implementation=
 of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed =
operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/funct=
ional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be formed is pr=
obably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but may not ne=
cessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives. =20

Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being addr=
essed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure tha=
t information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate and =
efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spannin=
g all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a steer=
ing committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with=
 Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, resource r=
equirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of stakehol=
ders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to =
review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for final input.  =
My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for Debbie and m=
e to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeli=
ne.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we revi=
ew the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate to take this =
item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cross-functional =
team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new team to focus on th=
is bullet point. =20

As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically address=
es Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems =
and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To=
 that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the "Op=
erational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeting th=
is commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Ser=
vices, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson. =20

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is=
 to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improv=
e the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines =
for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our=
 challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure t=
o operational risk.  =20

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operationa=
l risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of t=
he business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal,=
 for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or re=
port card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, =
as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication o=
f risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative asse=
ssments and quantitative measurements. =20

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team=
 has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
=09
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  T=
his approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to =
identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with=
 a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmatio=
n that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, Cr=
editAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the abili=
ty to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsh=
eet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuation m=
odels and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor interco=
mpany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report=
 variances=20
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational=
 risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team. =20

Thanks,

Rick Buy
