Subject: Update List

Hi Aneela,=20

I have agreed to have my assistant work with me to send updates for the Lega=
l=20
Agreement Status memo to you.  I have gotten several of the Agreements on th=
e=20
list in "executed" or "sent for execution" status and you will get an update=
d=20
memo next week confirming this.

In cleaning up our lotus notes this week, I noticed that several agreements=20
were not on your list but remain unexecuted.  Can you let me know whether or=
=20
not they remain a priority or interest?  If so, let me know so I can proceed=
=20
on them during the first week in April (at which time I predict ALL of the=20
other Agreements will be executed).

They include:

RBC Dominion Securities Corp.  (ECTI)

Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  (not sure which Enron company)

Societe General  (ENA)

BuySideDirect (ENA)

Merrill Lynch (ENA)
