Subject:	Market Area Allocations


	I received a question this morning from FGU regarding a cut they got on con=
tract 5141 for ID-2.  The total volume nominated on the

	contract did not change from ID-1 to ID-2, however, they did move around so=
me volumes on their delivery points - (decreased some

	primary delivery points and increased alternate-firm delv. points).  When w=
e did the Market Area allocation for ID-2, it looked at

	the "alternate point" increase as "incremental" - even though total contrac=
t volume remained the same.  I was somewhat confused by

	this cut  and talked with Joe Hoang.

	According to Joe:  PLEASE NOTE that the Market Area Flowing rights for a co=
ntract are retained by:

	1)   Contract
	2)   Gas Type
	3)   Nominator - Duns

=09
	Therefore, if a shipper  has a total of 30,000 mmbtu's of flowing gas right=
s on a contract:  10,000 Alternate firm and 20,000
	of Primary firm and they change their nom - reducing the Primary firm volum=
e to 15,000 and increase the Alternate firm
	volume to 15,000 - the additional 5,000 of Alternate firm would be consider=
ed "incremental".

	FYI

	Lynda
