Hey there!

Just wanted to see if you got to work okay!  Guess who was up in our studios
this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jen=
n
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be s=
o
much fun.  Now you're sitting there saying, "crap, why did I bring that
up...I was just kidding around!"
