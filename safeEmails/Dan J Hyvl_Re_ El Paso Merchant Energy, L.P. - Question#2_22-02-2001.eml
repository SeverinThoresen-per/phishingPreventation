No, maybe I am missing something.  Unless I am reading this incorrectly El=20
Paso Merchant Energy Canada Inc. assigned all assests and contracts to El=20
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. effective 12/31/00, therefore assigning K#9605445=
2=20
(10/1/00).  My line of thinking is that we will still have two masters for E=
l=20
Paso.  Also, since the master was written to cover Canadian business wouldn'=
t=20
it make this K a little broader for all transactions?=20

Dan,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El=20
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone=20
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep=20
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.
