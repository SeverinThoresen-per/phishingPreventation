Why it pays to be green Kyoto Wallflowers

When President Bush dismissed the Kyoto climate change treaty as "fatally fl=
awed," he meant to spare American companies from paying dearly to control po=
llution. But now that about 180 countries have pushed ahead with the pact wi=
thout the United States, American businesses with overseas operations are wo=
ndering if they'd be better off at the dance than on the sidelines.=20
Under the treaty, companies that reduce their own emissions of greenhouse ga=
ses can sell credits--essentially "licenses to pollute"- -to other businesse=
s. But the fine print is still unclear. So U.S. companies such as chemical g=
iant DuPont, which is already cutting its greenhouse gas emissions, may neve=
r get to earn Kyoto credits for reductions inside U.S. borders. "The United =
States will now have less influence over the development of the protocol and=
 the rules governing it," says Daniel Lashof, a climate-change scientist at =
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
There may be other unintended consequences. The Kyoto treaty, without the Un=
ited States, will become a giant commodity exchange, with companies and coun=
tries swapping emissions credits--but it might not end up cutting pollution.=
 That's because the market for credits may tilt out of balance. Countries of=
 the former Soviet Union, for example, will pocket extra credits because the=
 post-Communist industrial collapse reduced emissions there. They'd be selle=
rs. The brokers will be companies such as energy giant Enron, which hopes to=
 dominate a new commodity market for emissions credits.=20
Where are the buyers? David Victor at the Council on Foreign Relations doubt=
s there will be many. Take away American industry, which spits the most carb=
on dioxide into the atmosphere by far, and there might not be enough pollute=
rs demanding the credits that excuse them from emissions targets. In this sc=
enario, credits could become so cheap that companies would purchase them con=
stantly, rather than clean up. "Without the United States in the system," sa=
ys Victor, "the actual effect of the Kyoto treaty may turn out to be exactly=
 zero."=20
The United States may still participate, somehow. Bush has yet to decide whe=
ther he will propose a different approach or accept a parallel system. A fut=
ure U.S. president could also decide to join Kyoto. The uncertainty unnerves=
 American companies looking at making long-term investments in factories, po=
wer plants, or emissions- credit-swapping systems.=20
Since last week's Kyoto deal, pressure is building on Capitol Hill to implem=
ent new restrictions on emissions of several pollutants. The fight will be o=
ver whether to include carbon dioxide. Key Republican legislators, despite W=
hite House opposition, favor a market-based system that's not as stringent a=
s Kyoto. "We need something on carbon," admits a GOP aide. American business=
es may need something, too.=20

Some Energy Executives Urge U.S. Shift on Global Warming
By ANDREW C. REVKIN and NEELA BANERJEE

08/01/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

With President Bush continuing to oppose international or domestic restricti=
ons on gases linked to global warming, among the losers are energy companies=
 that favor government action and have already spent millions on voluntary e=
fforts to cut emissions.=20
Given little credence by the White House despite large expenditures on lobby=
ing and longstanding ties to administration officials, these companies are s=
hifting their focus to Congress, where several bills that would impose emiss=
ions restrictions are being debated or prepared.
But in that effort, the companies face formidable opposition from other ener=
gy concerns and trade groups that are fighting against any limits.=20
''There's an enormous amount of lobbying going on,'' said Rob Long, vice pre=
sident for government affairs at the National Mining Association. ''It's a t=
hree-ring circus.''=20
Among the companies that want the United States to embrace some form of gree=
nhouse-gas limits are oil producers including the Royal Dutch/Shell Group an=
d BP, as well as power-generating companies like Cinergy, AEP and Entergy, a=
ll of which have moved to reduce their own emissions.=20
Another company holding this view is the Enron Corporation of Houston, whose=
 chairman is Mr. Bush's friend Kenneth L. Lay. Enron was the largest contrib=
utor among energy companies last year to the Republican Party.=20
These companies, which include some of the world's biggest producers and use=
rs of fossil fuels, have concluded that limits on carbon dioxide and other g=
reenhouse, or heat-trapping, gases are inevitable. They say that by packagin=
g reductions in greenhouse gas emissions with other environmental measures, =
like cutting other power plant emissions, they could win concessions on othe=
r pollution rules.=20
And to plan long-term investments, they want the predictability that comes f=
rom quick adoption of clear rules, although more flexible ones than those ag=
reed to in Bonn a week ago by 178 countries that have accepted the Kyoto Pro=
tocol, the worldwide climate agreement that President Bush rejects.=20
Most of these businesses share Mr. Bush's view that the Kyoto agreement coul=
d hurt the United States economy and that it unfairly requires emissions red=
uctions only of big industrial nations. But many officials of these companie=
s said Mr. Bush had blundered by rejecting the agreement outright instead of=
 trying to repair it.=20
''What businesses want is policy certainty,'' an environmental expert for a =
large international energy company said. ''Bush has injected only turbulence=
=2E''=20
For all their wealth, power and influence, though, these companies say they =
have been cut out of discussions at the White House. The only ideas that hav=
e risen to the highest levels there are those of companies staunchly opposin=
g limits on emissions, according to lobbyists, government officials and exec=
utives.=20
The Bush administration denied last night that it was excluding any options =
or ideas in trying to develop an approach to global warming. A White House s=
pokeswoman, Claire E. Buchan, said: ''We are taking this issue very seriousl=
y. We're listening to constituencies who represent all perspectives.''=20
In contrast to executives of companies seeking limits on the gases, people r=
epresenting companies opposed to restrictions, including Exxon Mobil and man=
y coal companies, said they thought that their message was resonating.=20
Fredrick D. Palmer, executive vice president for legal and external affairs =
at Peabody Energy of St. Louis, one of the world's largest coal producers, s=
aid it was not really necessary to lobby the Bush administration on the issu=
e, because Big Coal's interests and the administration's views were in sync =
from the start.=20
''We don't need to be talking to the White House to know what they want,'' M=
r. Palmer said. ''I understand the importance of fossil fuels to the America=
n people. Dick Cheney understands that. The president understands that.''=20
For the moment, the two corporate camps -- which have dominated the discussi=
on, with environmental groups largely locked out -- have turned to Congress,=
 where an array of influential members from both parties is hoping to seize =
the initiative in policy making.=20
Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the independent and new chairman of th=
e Environment and Public Works Committee, has said that global warming is hi=
s top priority. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, has joined with S=
enator Robert C. Byrd, the veteran Democrat from West Virginia, a leading co=
al-producing state, in introducing a bill aimed at controlling emissions. Mr=
=2E Stevens has recently expressed deep concern about the apparently growing=
 damage in his state from climate change.=20
The energy industry now is focusing its efforts on the energy legislation mo=
ving through the House. But company executives and lobbyists are also meetin=
g with members of Congress and administration officials to shape the discuss=
ion over a variety of impending emissions measures and proposed changes in r=
egulations.=20
In mid-August, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to make recom=
mendations to the White House on how to reduce releases of nitrogen oxides, =
sulfur dioxide and mercury from power plants.=20
And Mr. Jeffords plans to hold meetings with industry, environmentalists and=
 agency officials in September to seek a consensus on a bill to control the =
three pollutants, along with ways to limit carbon dioxide, the dominant gree=
nhouse gas.=20
The one thing so far that unifies the energy industry is its opposition to t=
he Jeffords emissions bill in its current form, mainly because it stipulates=
 that old power plants install the latest technology to clean up emissions w=
ithin five years. Power producers say that the timetable is too stringent an=
d that such a change would disproportionately hurt the Midwest, where most o=
f the power is generated by older coal-fired plants that are targets of the =
legislation.=20
Beyond that, the industry separates into distinct camps. For energy companie=
s willing to accept some limits on warming gases, one goal is to firm up a m=
arket for tradeable credits earned by companies that make sharp cuts in emis=
sions or plant or protect forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.=20
For such credits to have value, a limit on emissions must exist, the company=
 officials say. Aware of corporate resistance to mandatory limits, some ener=
gy industry executives and lobbyists have proposed that the government spons=
or a voluntary program to reduce emissions. Once enrolled, companies would h=
ave to meet mandatory goals on reductions of greenhouse gases.=20
''We haven't said there must be mandatory caps on CO2,'' said Jeffrey Keeler=
, director of environmental strategies at Enron. ''But it's been proven that=
 voluntary programs don't work well; that's why we are where we are today. W=
e can have limits from the top down and not endanger the economy.''=20
Whether the Bush administration will accept even voluntary limits remains to=
 be seen. And later this year, the White House will again be the focus of po=
licy making.=20
Businesses that share the view Mr. Bush expressed in March, when he rejected=
 any binding limits on the warming gases, whether in a global accord or fede=
ral legislation, say they are confident that there will be no big shifts.=20
For example, Mr. Long, the mining association official, said he was perplexe=
d by those companies that want to reduce carbon dioxide, which his group and=
 its allies do not see as a pollutant or a threat to the environment.=20
''I think some of this is the hangover from the Clintonian era, when some of=
 these emissions changes seemed inevitable,'' he said. ''And I think some pe=
ople got locked into that mind-set. I think the world changed in January. It=
 can't have escaped their notice that the new president won't support constr=
aints on CO2 .''=20
One of the staunchest foes of limits on carbon dioxide is the Southern Compa=
ny of Atlanta, whose nuclear and coal-fired plants span Georgia, Florida, Al=
abama and Mississippi, and whose donations to the Republican Party last year=
 were second only to Enron's.=20
The company recently enlisted Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republ=
ican National Committee, as a lobbyist. Mr. Barbour mainly works to loosen e=
nforcement of environmental regulations affecting utilities, though other Wa=
shington lobbyists said that he had also argued against action on reducing c=
arbon dioxide emissions.=20
Mr. Barbour did not return phone calls yesterday seeking comment.=20
Power companies trying to find a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions thin=
k they have greater sway with Congress than they have with the White House. =
''The closer we get to midterm elections,'' a utility executive said, ''both=
 sides of the Hill will feel a high degree of vulnerability on environmental=
 issues, and some will retreat from the White House if they feel they need t=
o.''=20
In the meantime, opponents of emissions limits are not assuming that the Kyo=
to accord is dead, despite its having been greatly weakened by the rejection=
 from the United States, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.=20
Their lobbyists were out in force at last week's negotiations in Bonn, and t=
hey said they would keep working to defeat the international agreement, whic=
h is still subject to ratification in scores of countries. Among other thing=
s, they plan to keep pressure on the Bush administration to propose no alter=
natives -- particularly anything resembling a limit on greenhouse gases.=20
''The protocol is like the Titanic,'' said Glenn Kelly, executive director o=
f the Global Climate Coalition, which has fought against the Kyoto agreement=
 using contributions from industries that regard gas restrictions as a threa=
t.=20
Eventually, he said in an interview in Bonn, the Kyoto Protocol will hit an =
iceberg, but that will not be the end of the matter. ''After it sinks,'' he =
said, ''there are still going to be lifeboats that survive to be picked up b=
y the next ship that comes along.''

Mirant Corp. reported Tuesday that net income during the second quarter more=
 than doubled, boosted by record electricity sales in North America that inc=
luded California's deregulated power market.=20
The global independent power company said earnings from operations totaled $=
181 million, compared with $86 million for the comparable year-ago period wh=
en Mirant was operating as a subsidiary of Atlanta- based Southern Co.
The results exclude an after-tax write-off of $57 million related to Edelnor=
, its unprofitable Chilean power generator.=20
Mirant's earnings of 52 cents per share exceeded the mean estimate of analys=
ts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call of 46 cents per share and compar=
e with 25 cents for the second quarter of 2000 when more shares were outstan=
ding. Mirant, spun off by Southern Co. in April, forecast earnings of at lea=
st $1.90 per share for the year.=20
Marce Fuller, chief executive of the Atlanta-based company, said diluted ear=
nings per share grew 108 percent during the second quarter "largely because =
of our expertise in integrating generating assets with gas and power marketi=
ng in North America." Mirant said electricity sales rose 39 percent to a Nor=
th American record. Gas sales rose 53 percent.=20
Despite price controls imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission i=
n California's troubled electricity market, Mirant's Americas Group reported=
 earnings of $157 million, a 406 percent increase from $31 million a year ag=
o. Mirant does not report California results separately.=20
Mirant also announced a major power plant deal in Puerto Rico, a joint ventu=
re for the Southeast and a plant construction project in Washington state.=20
Mirant said it has agreed to acquire a natural gas-fueled 540- megawatt powe=
r plant in Penuelas, Puerto Rico, for $586 million from Edison Mission Energ=
y and Enron Corp., both Texas based. Mirant has other holdings in the Caribb=
ean. A newly acquired Jamaican utility added 2 cents per diluted share durin=
g the second quarter.=20
A new power plant development could put Mirant on track to compete with its =
former parent, Southern Co. Mirant and Cleco Corp., a Louisiana-based power =
company, have announced a joint venture to develop up to 2,000 megawatts of =
electric generating capacity across 11 Southern states.=20
The partners are already developing a power plant in Pineville, La., and Ful=
ler announced that development of two more Southeastern plants is in the wor=

More Energy Advisors May Have Conflicts Disclosure: Two officials of a Pasad=

Newly released documents show that two officials of a Pasadena-based energy =
consulting company bought large amounts of Edison International stock before=
 they were hired by the Davis administration to help rescue the state's bele=
aguered utilities.=20
Vikram Budhraja, president of the Electric Power Group, and Mark Skowronski,=
 an employee of the firm, bought multiple blocks of Edison International sto=
ck in January, just before landing a $6.2-million contract with the state.
Key details of potential conflicts of interest among Davis administration en=
ergy consultants are only emerging now, six months after many were hired, be=
cause the consultants were never asked to provide basic information required=
 under state law.=20
"There seems to be real negligence here on the part of the governor's staff =
to not tell them the rules," said Bob Stern, president of the Center for Gov=
ernment Studies in Los Angeles and an author of the state's Political Reform=
 Act. "Somebody dropped the ball. . . . That is a big problem."=20
That problem has been expanding over the past two weeks as new details conti=
nue trickling out. Last Friday, aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that five=
 consultants hired to help the state purchase electricity were fired for pos=
sible conflicts of interests.=20
Tuesday marked the first time the Davis administration released amended disc=
losure forms that included such important details as when the consultants bo=
ught and sold energy stocks.=20
One form was from Skowronski. It showed that he had purchased far more Ediso=
n stock than he had previously revealed. In all, he owned six blocks of Edis=
on stock, each valued between $10,000 and $100,000.=20
He also disclosed buying for his wife's retirement account a similarly value=
d block of stock in PG&E Corp., parent of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the =
state's largest utility.=20
Skowronski divested those holdings on July 18 as part of an order by the gov=
ernor, who had been stung by criticisms over secrecy surrounding his consult=
ants. It was not immediately clear how Skowronski, who makes $150 an hour wi=
th the state, fared overall in the Edison transactions.=20
In March, he sold stock in energy producer Reliant Inc. valued between $10,0=
00 and $100,000. At that time, he had been made the state's lead contract ne=
gotiator with the Houston-based firm.=20
Skowronski could not be reached for comment on Tuesday but said in a July 9 =
disclosure form that he "had no dealings with Edison and have not had a conf=
lict of interest."=20
His boss, Budhraja, also has come under scrutiny.=20
Budhraja was singled out in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on by California Secretary of State Bill Jones as an example of possible ins=
ider trading.=20
Jones estimated that Budhraja had made profits of more than 40% in January b=
uying and selling stock valued at between $20,000 and $200,000 in the parent=
 company of Southern California Edison, Jones said.=20
According to state financial disclosure forms, Budhraja bought between $10,0=
00 and $100,000 of Edison stock on the same day Davis declared an energy eme=
rgency and announced that the state would buy power for California's cash-st=
arved major utilities. Budhraja purchased another block of Edison stock five=
 days later.=20
A former Edison executive, Budhraja also reported that he was paid more than=
 $100,000 on a retainer to provide consulting services to the utility when n=
eeded. His services had not been requested since the third quarter of last y=
ear, according to the disclosure form.=20
Budhraja, who is being paid $275 an hour by the state, reported selling his =
Edison stock Jan. 29, which he said was the first opportunity to divest afte=
r going to work for the state. Among his duties has been to negotiate power =
purchase contracts and provide strategic advice.=20
Attorney Stephen Kaufman said Budhraja was simply a savvy investor.=20
"Mr. Budhraja was observing what has happening in the marketplace at the tim=
e, reading the newspapers, and saw what he thought to be a good opportunity =
to purchase these stocks."=20
The latest details on stock purchases by state energy consultants came as Da=
vis spokesman Steve Maviglio defended his own energy investments. They inclu=
de San Jose-based generator Calpine Corp. and Houston power trader Enron Cor=
p.=20
Maviglio was repeatedly questioned about the ethics of his holdings Tuesday =
during his traditional weekly media briefing with reporters, and remained de=
fiant, insisting he had done nothing improper.=20
Spokeswoman Hilary McLean initially took questions from the two dozen print,=
 radio and television reporters in attendance, but Maviglio, who was standin=
g beside the podium, eventually came to his own defense.=20
"I can't help myself," he said as he approached the microphone.=20
Maviglio reiterated his stance that he was not privileged with any inside in=
formation unavailable to the public when he placed his order for Calpine sto=
ck on May 31. He said he made the move after reading newspapers and analysts=
' recommendations.=20
He said he would be willing to divest the stock if Davis asks him to, but ma=
intained his belief that the transaction did not violate any laws.=20
Reporters sharply questioned Maviglio's insistence that he was not privy to =
more information on the state's electricity purchases than the general publi=
c. Maviglio and McLean said they were out of the loop on such details.=20
Maviglio blamed the press for making his stock an issue.=20
"Perception is what you create," he said.=20
The controversy, Stern said, underscores the importance of timely filing to =
safeguard the public interest.=20
"I think as many high-ranking people as possible should be filing these so w=
e know of potential conflicts," he said.=20
Times staff writers Daryl Kelley, Mitchell Landsberg and Robert J. Lopez con=

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Enron powers ahead despite a big black mar=
k: Poorly performing broadband unit has helped to halve group's share price,=
 writes Julie Earle:
Financial Times, Aug 1, 2001
By JULIE EARLE
Ken Lay, Enron chairman, should have a lot to shout about. The US pipeline c=
ompany turned energy trader saw second-quarter net income jump almost 40 per=
 cent to Dollars 404m as revenue more than trebled to Dollars 50bn - fuelled=
 by its dominant energy trading business, where it is three times as big as =
its nearest competitor.=20
There is a black mark on Enron's balance sheet, however, in the shape of its=
 poorly performing Broadband Services division.=20
This trades bandwidth in much the same way as other Enron units trade gas an=
d electricity - except that broadband is losing money.=20
Telecommunications companies that invested heavily in fibre optic networks -=
 including established carriers such as WorldCom, AT&T and Level 3 - are str=
uggling with over-capacity and lack of demand.=20
Investors have driven Enron's stock down from a high of more than Dollars 90=
 last August to the current level of about Dollars 46.=20
Part of the issue, according to Mr Lay, is that Texas-based Enron - created =
in 1985 by the merger of natural gas providers Houston Natural Gas and Inter=
north - can be a difficult company to understand.=20
"I am annoyed about it. I think the transparency argument is thrown out by p=
eople trying to confuse people who do not follow the company closely," he sa=
ys.=20
Those who do follow Enron closely know that broadband is unlikely to turn ar=
ound any time soon, because of continuing weakness in the telecoms market.=20
Enron has moved to scale back its broadband activities by announcing an unsp=
ecified number of job cuts and other cost-cutting after the division's secon=
d-quarter losses ballooned to Dollars 102m from Dollars 8m a year earlier.=20
At the time of the results announcement last month, Jeff Skilling, Enron pre=
sident, warned the unit was unlikely to make a profit by 2002, as the compan=
y had earlier predicted.=20
Mr Lay, however, appears more optimistic. "With increased activity (and) inc=
reased transactions, we still have a good chance of breaking even in that bu=
siness by year-end next year," he says.=20
He maintains that Enron's foray into broadband 18 months ago was not a mista=
ke.=20
"With hindsight, we wouldn't have geared up as much as we did. We said from =
day one there would be a glut and we got a glut," he said.=20
"The problem is that glut over the past 90 days or so has turned into a tota=
l meltdown of the marketplace and it will be more difficult to do business."=
=20
In the meantime, Enron is cutting back its spending on bandwidth significant=
ly, to Dollars 73m in the third quarter and to Dollars 40m by next year. It =
will focus on two areas, bandwidth trading and packaged services for busines=
s customers.=20
Enron expects more pain ahead for broadband but does not plan to buy any mor=
e fibre. "We've got Dollars 1.2bn invested and Dollars 2bn by year-end. We h=
ave the network we need," Mr Lay says.=20
While broadband is an immediate issue, transparency remains a niggling conce=
rn. Mr Lay insists that suggestions the company's profits are boosted by ass=
et sales are "unfounded" (although in the last quarter, Enron raised as much=
 as Dollars 1bn from the sale of three plants).=20
"Analysts that follow us closely understand how we make money and where we m=
ake money," he says.=20
Ray Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, believes Enron is getting punish=
ed for being too aggressive. The group is one of a number of energy traders =
- including rivals Reliant Energy and Duke Energy - being questioned in Cali=
fornia over alleged manipulation of power prices.=20
Mr Lay says volatile gas and electricity prices have little impact on Enron'=
s earnings, with the company's profit being driven by higher trading volumes=
=2E=20
"As long as we have the more extensive physical network to move product arou=
nd, and have the greatest volume and liquidity, we will find ways to always =
buy or find the product cheaper than other people can and move it to the mar=
ket place."=20
The company's wholesale business unit, the group's main profit driver, deriv=
es 70 per cent of its business from North America. In the last quarter, Enro=
n sold almost twice as much power in North America as it did a year ago; in =
Europe, it sold five times as much.=20
Enron is also excited by signs that the US regional transmission grid for wh=
olesale electricity could be opened up. It believes only 20 per cent of the =
market is currently open, and that this could increase to 90-95 per cent. Co=

KENNETH Lay, the boss of Houston-based Enron Corporation, has said that his =

Dabhols power project in Maharashtra, the largest single overseas investment=

Under political pressure, its power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra =

The ostensible problem is that power from DPC is too expensive and MSEB cant=
 afford it. Before getting into the nitty-gritty of numbers, ask yourself wh=
at is the rate that India can afford for electricity?=20
Numbers show that India cannot afford power at any rate that is commercially=
 viable even for state-owned utilities generating coal fired electricity in =
fully depreciated plants.=20
About 40 per cent of the electricity generated in India is not paid for. Off=
icially, nearly a quarter of all power generated is lost in transmission and=
 distribution.=20
A lot more is billed below cost because consumers who are supposed to pay do=
 not. The government reckons that the cost of generating a unit of power is =
Rs 2.80. This sells for less than Rs 2.10 per unit on average.=20
So, why blame Enron for wanting to pull out, when the numbers show that ther=
es no money to be made producing power? Companies like AES, which ventured i=
nto Orissa have faced defaults.=20
Cesco, a private distribution company, finds that it cannot disconnect consu=
mers who dont pay. Cesco cant pay its own employees, nor can it pay AES.=20
Who wants to do business here? Given this grim scenario, even if Enron wants=
 to exit, it will find it hard to find a buyer for its equity stake.=20
There is absolutely no guarantee that MSEB, which has driven itself to bankr=
uptcy, will pay the new owner regularly for power. There are definite limits=
 to how low the cost of power from a new, gas fired plant (as DPC is suppose=
d to be in future) can go.=20
And many Indians today seem unwilling to buy power at any cost. Without quic=
k, drastic reforms India will plunge into the heart of darkness.

US Exim set to move SC on Dabhol row

NEW DELHI: The US Export-Import (Exim) Bank is set to move the Supreme Court=
 in a day or two, challenging the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commiss=
ion's (MERC) eligibility to adjudicate on the tariff row between the Enron-p=
romoted Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.=20
The move, being seen as indirect US pressure to expedite resolution of the i=
ssue, is likely to bolster the special leave petition (SLP) filed by DPC and=
 applications by its international lenders for the Supreme Court's intervent=
ion.
US Exim, which is a lender, is likely to base its application on the premise=
 that since the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB clearly stipul=
ates international arbitration in case of any dispute, MERC has no role to p=
lay in its resolution.=20
It may also cite Section 52 of the PPA that makes it clear the `conferral' o=
f jurisdiction under Section 22 (1)(C) and (D) and Section 22 (2)(N) ``would=
 override the provisions of all other substantive as well as procedural laws=
 of India, including the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,=
 1996''.=20
It is also likely to take the stand that for a stable and predictable busine=
ss environment, it is essential that arbitration agreements are upheld and a=
ny party should not be allowed to frustrate this through ``collateral procee=
dings''.=20
Eleven international lenders on Friday had urged the court to hear DPC's pet=
ition against a Bombay High Court order referring the dispute to MERC. The i=
nternational lenders have a Rs 2,088 crore ($444 million) exposure, based on=
 a conversion rate of Rs 47 to a dollar, in the Rs 12,000 crore ($3 billion)=
 power project.=20
With their application, the international lenders have made it clear that th=
ey are running out of patience. They have said in their application that the=
 Supreme Court should intervene to end the uncertainty over enforceability o=
f arbitration pacts and pave the way for early resolution of the issue.=20
Enron, DPC's main promoter, has about $700 million exposure, or 65 per cent =
equity, in the project. It is now looking for an exit over a demand for rene=
gotiating the price for selling power.

Reliance's Ambani on Enron's $3 Bln India Project: Comment
2001-08-01 02:52 (New York)


     Mumbai, Aug. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Anil Ambani, managing director
of Reliance Industries Ltd., India's biggest private company,
comments on speculation it may buy Enron Corp's $3 billion India
power project.
     Enron Corp., the world's top energy trader, last week told
the Indian government to buy out its 65 percent stake in Dabhol.
It's been fighting with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,
its sole customer, for seven months to recover $64 million in
unpaid bills.

     ``Reliance Industries is not interested in Dabhol Power Co.''
Enron's India unit that owns the 2,144-megawatt power plant.
     ``Our intention is to focus on our existing businesses and
the ones we have on hand. We have a presence in power and oil and
gas.''
     Reliance owns 30 percent of BSES Ltd., a power generator in
Mumbai, and gets three percent of its sales from oil exploration.
It runs the world's seventh-biggest refinery and has won 25 oil
sites the past two years.

Reliance Not Interested in Enron India Project, Official Says

     Mumbai, August 1 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,
India's biggest private company, doesn't plan to buy out Enron
Corp.'s local unit, Dabhol Power Co., managing director Anil
Ambani said.
     ``Reliance is not interested in a Dabhol stake,'' Ambani told
reporters and analysts yesterday.  ``Our intention is to focus on
our existing businesses.''
     Enron Corp., the world's top energy trader, last week told
the Indian government to buy out its 65 percent stake in Dabhol.
It's been fighting with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,
its sole customer, for seven months to recover $64 million in
unpaid bills.
     The board stopped buying Dabhol's power in May, saying it's
too expensive, prompting the generator to halt production. The
plant can produce 740 megawatts of power and the company had
planned to add another 2,184 megawatts of capacity this year.
     Reliance, which makes 10 million tons of petrochemicals a
year, holds a 30 percent stake in BSES Ltd., owner of a 500-
megawatt power plant about 60 miles north of Mumbai. Some analysts
expected it Reliance may buy out Dabhol to strengthen its power
business.
     Reliance has expanded into telecommunications with plans to
build a fiber-optic network linking 115 Indian cities. The 37,000-
mile network would cost $5.3 billion and carry calls for its local
and overseas long-distance and cellular phone services.
     Reliance plans to expand its oil and gas business, currently
three percent of total sales, by developing the 25 sites it's won
the past two years for oil exploration. Reliance Petroleum Ltd.,
64 percent owned by Reliance, runs the world's seventh-biggest
refinery at Jamnagar in western India.

Embattled Rep. Condit continues fund-raising, campaign spending
By DON THOMPSON

SACRAMENTO (AP) - U.S. Rep. Gary Condit continued raising and spending campa=
ign money this spring at about his usual pace, despite the media and police =
frenzy over his romantic ties to a missing Washington, D.C., intern.=20
Campaign records released Tuesday night show the Ceres Democrat raised $195,=
370 and spent $144,270 the first half of the year - including a previously d=
isclosed $10,000 to the Chandra Levy reward account immediately after she di=
sappeared in early May.
The records show Condit also incurred a $206 in bills for in-flight telephon=
e calls May 30, just as attention was shifting to the married 53-year-old co=
ngressman's alleged involvement with the 24-year-old Levy. He also spent $2,=
373 for a news clipping service June 15.=20
Condit, whose congressional financial disclosure forms show little personal =
wealth, has hired a high-profile Washington lawyer to represent him during t=
he Levy matter. That has led some to speculate whether he would pay his lega=
l bills from his campaign funds, but this report shows no payments to either=
 attorney Abbe Lowell or public relations specialist Marina Ein, who now rep=
resent Condit.=20
He continued his practice of buying what are labeled gifts for constituents,=
 including flowers, items from a Modesto camera store, and favors from a San=
 Francisco shop named Rumors.=20
Despite some Republicans' calls for Condit's resignation, his staff says he =
has no intention of stepping down. His campaign account also reflects no cur=
tailment.=20
Two years ago, when Condit was known just as a conservative Democrat from Ca=
lifornia, he raised a little more than $200,000 in the first six months of 1=
999, including $97,000 from individuals and $104,000 from political action c=
ommittees. He spent $128,000 in the same period.=20
This time he raised $121,645 from individuals and $73,725 from PACs. His con=
tributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists were particularly large during=
 June, including two apparent fund-raising events as the controversy swirled=
=2E=20
At least seven Californians in Congress have campaign bank accounts of more =
than $500,000, including two with more than $1 million. Rep. Loretta Sanchez=
, D-Santa Ana, is sitting on $1.2 million in cash, while Rep. Jerry Lewis, R=
-Redlands, has $1 million in the bank.=20
With the boundaries of congressional districts about to change in redistrict=
ing, the money could come in handy to scare off challengers or allow a polit=
ician to get to know new constituents. "It's insurance," said Gary Jacobson,=
 a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego.=
 "They don't know what's going to happen. They may not have to spend it all.=
"=20
Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Simi Valley, has made some Democratic lists of potent=
ially vulnerable incumbents. But Gallegly already has $780,000 in cash avail=
able for his reelection campaign.=20
Other Californians with more than a half-million dollars in the bank are: Re=
p. Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R-Del Mar, with $771,000; Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San=
 Mateo, with $723,000; Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Bakersfield, with $599,000; and R=
ep. Wally Herger, R-Marysville, with $522,000.=20
Thomas, new chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, rais=
ed $342,000 in the first six months of the year, most of it from political a=
ction committees that reflect the broad range of industries with interests i=
n tax legislation.=20
Energy company PACs contributed to many members of Congress, including sever=
al in California. Among them, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton, stood out in the =
midst of California's power crisis by returning $1,500 to the Dynegy PAC and=
 $1,000 to the Enron PAC.=20

Calif Gov Won't Fire Spokesman For Calpine Stock Purchase

07/31/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California Gov. Gray Davis "absolutely (does) not"=
 intend to fire his senior press secretary because he bought stock in Calpin=
e Corp (CPN) in June, Davis' senior political advisor Garry South said Tuesd=
ay.=20
The press secretary, Steve Maviglio, revealed Monday that he bought 300 shar=
es of Calpine stock on June 20, 2001. The disclosure came one day after sour=
ces at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said they were investigat=
ing members of Davis' administration to see if they bought stock in energy c=
ompanies using information that was unavailable to the public.=20
California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who is running for governor agains=
t Davis, renewed calls Tuesday for Maviglio's dismissal at a press conferenc=
e in Los Angeles.
Maviglio said he bought the Calpine stock based on information he read in th=
e newspapers. He also said he will not resign and will only sell his energy =
stocks if told to do so by his attorney or the governor. He has also owned s=
tock in Enron Corp (ENE) since 1996.=20
State conflict-of-interest laws say public officials can't negotiate contrac=
ts for companies in which they hold stock, and can't use their positions to =
influence any state decisions about those companies.=20
Maviglio is not in a position where he could exercise a conflict of interest=
, said Davis senior political advisor Garry South.=20
"He is not a policymaker. He says what it is decided that he will say," Sout=
h said. "To make a statement about something is not a conflict of interest. =
If that were the case, every person in state government would have to divest=
 every stock they have before they made a public statement."=20
By law, state employees must file financial disclosure forms once a year and=
 within 30 days of being hired. Jones demanded Tuesday that all members of D=
avis' staff, as well as consultants and contractors, file updated financial =
disclosure statements within 48 hours.=20
Jones said the employees in his own office are current with their financial =
filings, though they haven't necessarily filed updates.=20
"My office is involved in elections, not energy," Jones said. He added that =
the governor's staff needs to update financial disclosure forms for January =
through July in light of the state's taking on a power-buying role for insol=
vent utilities in January.=20
Jones also said he did not accept gubernatorial campaign contributions from =
energy companies.=20
Last week, five state energy consultants were fired by Davis' staff for pote=
ntial conflicts of interest arising from their ownership of Calpine stock. T=
he state has signed nearly half of its $43 billion in long-term energy contr=
acts with Calpine.=20
The consultants, who were hired by the state in January, didn't file economi=
c interest statements until July, when Jones revealed that consultants and e=
nergy traders held stock in energy companies from which they were buying pow=
er.=20
Davis has accused several power suppliers of price gouging, but has spared C=
alpine the invective, saying the San Jose-based generator has charged prices=
 below that of other generators and has invested in California for the long =
haul. The California Independent System Operator, however, has listed Calpin=
e as one of the generators that has racked up millions in overcharges for wh=
olesale power.=20

Calif Power-Contract Negotiator Bought GE, Enron Stock
By Jason Leopold

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A consultant hired by the state of California to h=
elp negotiate long-term power contracts made significant purchases of electr=
icity-industry stock at a time when deals were still being hammered out, sta=
te financial disclosure forms show.=20
Navigant Consulting Inc. Senior Managing Director Ronald Nichols, hired as a=
 senior energy consultant by the state Department of Water Resources in Janu=
ary, purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 of stock in each of General Elec=
tric Co. (GE) and Enron Corp. (ENE) in April, according to documents obtaine=
d Tuesday by Dow Jones Newswires.
GE Power Systems, a major GE unit, is the largest U.S. supplier of turbines =
for power generation. A number of GE turbines have been ordered by developer=
s that signed power-supply deals with the DWR. Enron is the top trader of po=
wer and natural gas in the West and the country as a whole.=20
California has signed $43 billion in long-term power contracts, the details =
of which weren't released publicly until mid-June.=20
Nichols will likely have to sell his shares in Enron, which never signed pow=
er deals with the state, but the DWR has allowed him to keep his shares in G=
eneral Electric, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said.=20
"It was determined his holding in General Electric was not required to be di=
vested, because GE is not considered an energy production company," Hidalgo =
said.=20
Nichols, who the DWR said analyzes and negotiates power contracts and helps =
the agency calculate its revenue requirements, also said there was no confli=
ct of interest.=20
"That stock is not a power generator, and the generation equipment that they=
 develop is but a small portion of what their business is," said Nichols, wh=
o was traveling with state Treasurer Phil Angelides in New York. "They're a =
multi-conglomerate these days. It's been determined by DWR and by me that it=
's not a conflict, and it's been upheld in the review" of the financial disc=
losure form.=20
Moreover, he said, the decision whether to use GE turbines rested with devel=
opers of power plants.=20
GE Big In Power=20

GE Power Systems is the largest supplier of power-generation turbines in the=
 U.S., and it has benefited directly from long-term deals power suppliers si=
gned with the DWR.=20
A 20-year contract signed with the DWR in February, for example, led develop=
er Calpine Corp. (CPN) to order 11 GE peak-demand turbines worth about $150 =
million. Calpine won't place such orders for "peaking" units without contrac=
ts in place to back them up, the company said on a conference call last week=
=2E=20
Calpine announced April 19 that it would buy 46 turbines from GE for power p=
lants under development nationwide.=20
"I'm not aware of any specific deal Calpine or any other generator had with =
a specific vendor," Nichols said.=20
GE Power Systems was GE's fastest-growing unit in 2001. First-half revenues =
and profits at the unit grew three times as fast as they did at the runner-u=
p unit. GE Power Systems racked up $1.23 billion in second-quarter profits -=
 up 63% from the same period the year before - making it the second-largest =
contributor to GE's $3.90 billion in earnings for the period.=20
Shareholdings in energy companies by members of Gov. Gray Davis' power-buyin=
g team have been the subject of a political battle pitting Davis against pot=
ential gubernatorial rival Bill Jones, the Republican secretary of state. Qu=
estions have been raised about the validity of power contracts negotiated by=
 those with possible conflicts of interest.=20
In addition to the scrutiny at the state level, the U.S. Securities and Exch=
ange Commission is investigating members of the Davis administration and the=
 state's energy traders to determine whether stocks were purchased using ins=
ider information.=20
Forty energy traders and consultants with the DWR filed financial disclosure=
 statements in July under pressure from Jones. Ten of those filings revealed=
 financial interests in energy companies. Five of those filers have been fir=
ed, and one has resigned. Others remain on board.=20
Link To AES=20

Sumner White, a Navigant consultant hired March 6 to work on the long-term c=
ontracts, reported receiving annual income of between $10,000 and $100,000 f=
rom AES Corp. (AES) for his work with the company. The nature of that work w=
asn't immediately known.=20
AES operates power plants in California under an arrangement with Williams C=
os. (WMB), under which Williams takes almost all the risk and profit. AES ha=
sn't signed any long-term supply deals with California, although Williams di=
d.=20
White wasn't available for comment.=20
Thirty DWR consultants and traders reported having no stake in energy compan=
ies. They include ranking members of Davis' power-buying operation. Top ener=
gy trader Susan Lee, senior Davis energy adviser David Freeman and head of t=
he DWR's power buying operation Pete Garris declared they had no financial i=
nterests at all, according to reports obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.=20
In addition, reports filed in March show DWR Director Thomas Hannigan and DW=
R Deputy Director Ray Hart had no interests in energy companies in 2000, the=
 year covered by the disclosures.=20
California's Political Reform Act requires state employees to disclose their=
 financial interests within 30 days of being hired and then every year. In a=
ll, 60 traders and consultants work for the DWR, not all of whom were requir=
ed to file disclosure statements in July.=20
On Monday, chief Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio disclosed that he purchased =
300 shares of Calpine Corp. (CPN) stock on June 20. Maviglio hasn't been nam=
ed by the SEC, which hasn't identified the subjects of its investigation. He=

USA: Texas retail power deregulation starts slowly, smoothly.
By C. Bryson Hull

07/31/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, July 31 (Reuters) - The first steps toward a deregulated retail ele=
ctricity market in Texas went smoothly but slowly Tuesday, as the first cust=
omers were switched from their utility to new power providers.=20
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, after two months of delays began =
moving customers over to their new providers, launched what will be a very c=
losely watched transition to deregulation.
"We're starting slowly, so we have had 75 switch-overs today and 75 tomorrow=
, and then we'll be ramping up as we test the systems," ERCOT spokeswoman Je=
nnifer Taylor said.=20
The full conversion should be finished by the end of August, she said.=20
The pilot program hinged on the conversion of ERCOT's 10 control areas to a =
single control room in Austin. The pilot had been slated to start in June, b=
ut three delays related to power-scheduling software glitches held it back.=20
Those small delays had led some in California, where a failed partial deregu=
lation attempt led to blackouts and the near-collapse of the state's two big=
gest investor-owned utilities, to snicker at Texas' early obstacles.=20
But California's fate has put the eyes of the U.S. squarely on Texas' transi=
tion to an unfettered marketplace.=20
One big difference: the wholesale Texas power market has been operating smoo=
thly since its deregulation in 1995. A major hang-up in California was its h=
alf-measure deregulation of the wholesale market, which led to massive price=
 spikes because utilities were prevented from buying forward contracts to pr=
otect against volatile prices swings.=20
For whatever reason, Texas customers did not exactly flock to join the pilot=
 program, which ends when full deregulation begins on Jan. 1, 2002.=20
Roughly 90,000 individual retail customers joined the pilot program, which o=
ffered 265,000 spots on a first-come, first-serve basis to try the test run.=
=20
"This is a historic moment for electric customers in Texas. Texans can now c=
hoose their electric company the same way they choose other goods and servic=
es in their everyday lives," said Texas Public Utilities Commission Chairman=
 Max Yzaguirre, the former head of Enron Corp.'s ENE.N Mexican division.=20
The tepid response from individuals contrasted with the stampede of commerci=
al and industrial customers who joined the pilot. The industrial pilot was c=
ompletely subscribed well before its kickoff.=20
Texas' deregulation law limited pilot participation at 5percent of both cate=
gories of customer.=20
The new retail providers include the deregulated divisions of traditional ut=
ilities like Reliant Energy , Entergy Corp. , Texas-New Mexico Power Co. and=
 TXU Corp. . Other entrants include Royal Dutch/Shell's Shell Energy and Gre=
en Mountain Energy, which uses renewable resources and other cleaner methods=
 of power generation.=20
The New Power Co., a joint venture of Enron, AOL/Time Warner Inc. and IBM , =
is also in the market.=20
There are also 10 registered aggregators, who put together large groups of c=
ustomers so they will have the bulk leverage to negotiate lower rates from r=
etail providers.

Northwest utilities seek millions in refunds - some from neighbors

07/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

OLYMPIA (AP) - Half a dozen Pacific Northwest utilities are seeking nearly $=
700 million in reimbursements from energy suppliers they accuse of price gou=
ging, but some of the accused gougers are actually other utilities from the =
region.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission begins an inquiry into the charges =
on Wednesday.
Papers submitted to the commission detail the allegations, and point fingers=
 at national power producers such as Enron, Dynegy and Duke Energy. But they=
 also name companies closer to home. For instance, Tacoma Power is seeking a=
bout $28 million in refunds from Spokane-based Avista Energy.=20
"The legal standard, first, is that rates have to be just and reasonable," P=
hillip Chabot, Tacoma Power's attorney, told a group of Northwest public rad=
io stations on Monday.=20
California's failed power deregulation scheme combined with drought to tight=
en electrical supplies in the region in recent months, forcing utilities to =
pay record prices for power on the spot market. In some cases, the price jum=
ped from less than $100 to more than $1,000 per megawatt hour.=20
In general, changing the rates paid for power after the transaction is prohi=
bited by law. But Chabot said the extremely high prices that suppliers charg=
ed for power in the heat of the crisis warrant the call for refunds. Federal=
 law also requires just and reasonable rates.=20
"It strains credulity to think that under normal circumstances people would =
willingly enter into contracts for purchases of energy at $2,000 or $3,000 a=
 megawatt hour," he said.=20
The accused power suppliers hotly dispute refund claims, saying the transact=
ions involved willing sellers and willing buyers.=20
"To impose retroactively refunds, you're penalizing the people or the entiti=
es that managed their supply-demand portfolio in a prudent manner and you're=
 rewarding those that did not," said Avista Energy President Dennis Vermilli=
on. "That seems unfair."=20
If Avista were ordered to pay refunds, that could affect rates for its own c=
ustomers in Eastern Washington and northern Idaho, Vermillion said.=20
No utility came out of the West Coast energy crisis with completely clean ha=
nds, he noted.=20
For example, while Seattle City Light claims it was overcharged by about $22=
2 million, the utility was sometimes able to sell surplus power on the open =
market as well, filings with the FERC indicate.=20
Idaho Power, Snohomish Public Utility District and Pacificorp also could owe=
 refunds as well as collect them, according to the filings.=20
Meanwhile, Puget Sound Energy, which sold energy when the market was high, w=
ants the entire inquiry dismissed, arguing that the refund seekers made thei=
r claims too late.

PUERTO RICO: Mirant to buy Puerto Rican power plant, LNG terminal.

07/31/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

PENUELAS, Puerto Rico, July 31 (Reuters) - Energy giant Mirant Corp. said on=
 Tuesday it will buy a 540-megawatt power plant and a liquefied natural gas =
(LNG) terminal operated by Puerto Rican-based EcoElectrica Holdings Ltd.=20
Under the agreement, Mirant will acquire 100 percent of EcoElectrica Holding=
s Ltd. whose shares are currently owned by Edison International unit Edison =
Mission Energy and Enron Corp. , Mirant said.
A Mirant spokesman said the company would pay around $586 million for the as=
sets and assume liabilities of $600 million.=20
No date was given as to when the deal would likely close.=20
The spokesman said the deal was "technically" with Edison Mission and Enron =
because they own the shares of EcoElectrica.=20
He added the Puerto Rican LNG terminal would continue to provide gas for the=
 power plant and said there were no plans at this point to begin exporting L=
NG from the terminal to U.S., Caribbean or Latin American markets.=20
Mirant said in the statement it began importing LNG into the United States i=
n April 2001, but did not say where it was buying the LNG.=20

 and injecting gas into spherical high-pressure tanks onto special LNG carri=
