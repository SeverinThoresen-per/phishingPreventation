Subject:	United States Gypsum Bankrupcy

I called Christine Slayman at US Gypsum to discuss clearing the credit balan=
ce on the A/R.  Christine informed me that US Gypsum had voluntarily filed C=
hapter 11.  Christine is to get back with me at a later date to discuss furt=
her.

I then asked Sherry Forbish if she knew anything about the bankrupcy filing.=
  Sherry had not heard anything and we called Tim Johanson.  Tim informed us=
 that Rob Cooper of US Gypsum said the bankrupcy filing was to protect thems=
elves from asbestos litigation.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Kathy
