Elizabeth,

           Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices Altra=
de is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have foun=
d in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct and=
 this is not a large amount in question.

                                                                            =
                                                               Thank You!
