Group,
We have some changes regarding Enron Canada.=20

One...they have hired their own staff to handle the dispatching of the=20
Transalta units into and out of the pool.  We will still serve as a back-up=20
resource for questions from their new staff.  And some of their new hires=20
will be rotating down here to get a better understanding of what we do. =20

Two...as a result of having staff, they will be having more of an opportunit=
y=20
to purchase transmission across BC to the US.  When this happens we typicall=
y=20
will have very little time to sell this power (mostly we get called on the=20
status of the power at the bottom).  However, please keep in mind that this=20
power is typically priced between $10 and $65 a mw.  If you have questions=20
regarding purchasing from Enron Canada please ask me.  We have told Canada=20
that there is no bid in the Northwest two different times now.  If there is=20
no bid for $65 power, lets communicate that to Canada before they spend mone=
y=20
on transmission.    If you have questions regarding purchasing from Enron=20
Canada please ask me.  Please do your best to improve communication and to=20
prevent these situations from happening again.
Thank you.
Bill
