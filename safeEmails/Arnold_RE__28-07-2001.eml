Errol,
Is it possible for me to get a report of option positions broken out by gree=
ks and strike concentration?  Also, I would like to know if it is possible f=
or you to give me the financial desk's average gamma exposure over the last =
6 months.  Trying to get "handle" on typical exposures?

Thanks,
Frank
