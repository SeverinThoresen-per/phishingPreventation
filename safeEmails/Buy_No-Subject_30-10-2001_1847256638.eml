Please ring Draper at AEP

Current position:

We have paid them all of the margin  they have contractual rights for - $33.=
5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract.
However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is b=
eing driven by Bill Reid on their power floor -ex Enron employee), the amoun=
t is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this).=20

Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and a=
nything you can do to help is appreciated.  I believe some of this is vindic=
tive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what h=
e is up to.
