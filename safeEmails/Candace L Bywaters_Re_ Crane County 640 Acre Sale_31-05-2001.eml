Yes, I do.  We had all discussed it and decided to use a "belt and=20
suspenders" approach and reserved the rights, if any.  You're probably right=
=20
not to mention them.

Thanks!

Candace,
 If you look at your purchase document, you will see that you never received=

the minerals.  Do you agree?

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the=
=20
above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want=
=20
to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would lik=
e=20
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Thanks, Dan.

Candy
