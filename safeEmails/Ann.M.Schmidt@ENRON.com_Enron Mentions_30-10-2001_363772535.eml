Enron Debt Is Downgraded by Moody's; SEC Moves Company Probe to Washington

In another potentially serious blow to Enron Corp.'s finances, Moody's Inves=
tors Service Inc. lowered its ratings by one notch on the energy company's s=
enior unsecured debt and kept the company under review for a possible furthe=
r downgrade.=20
It also was learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission has moved it=
s inquiry into Enron's finances to the agency's Washington headquarters from=
 its regional office in Fort Worth, Texas. The change is a sign that the pro=
be is being treated as a high priority, according to a person with knowledge=
 of the inquiry. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
Moody's reduction on Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Ba=
a1 leaves the company's credit rating two levels above noninvestment grade. =
If the energy-trading giant's ratings were to fall to a noninvestment-grade =
level, there could be serious consequences for Enron. It could throw the Hou=
ston company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of bo=
rrowings and force it under the terms of various financial agreements to iss=
ue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, which would dilute t=
he value of existing shares.=20
While Enron still has some room before hitting noninvestment-grade status, t=
here have been concerns among analysts and investors that the company's rece=
nt troubles could escalate. During recent days Enron's bonds have traded at =
levels similar to securities that carry a noninvestment-grade rating. Prices=
 of the company's bonds improved somewhat yesterday, though its stock price =
continued to fall sharply. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite tradi=
ng, Enron stock was at $13.81, down $1.59 or 10%, and topped the most-active=
 list with 36.4 million shares changing hands. Enron's share price has falle=
n more than 50% during the past two weeks.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company is "working diligently" to keep an inv=
estment-grade credit rating. Among other things, the nation's biggest energy=
-trading firm is in negotiations with its banks on a new $1 billion to $2 bi=
llion credit line to bolster its liquidity. Enron repeatedly has said its bu=
siness operations remain strong.=20
Yesterday's ratings downgrade is the latest piece of bad news for a company =
that has been engulfed in turmoil during the past two weeks. Confidence in i=
ts financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a=
 $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of sha=
reholder equity related to transactions it had carried out with entities con=
nected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Last week, Enron =
named a successor to Mr. Fastow and said the SEC was looking into the deals.=
=20
The SEC is looking into whether Enron violated federal-securities laws regar=
ding its handling and disclosure of the transactions connected to Mr. Fastow=
, the person familiar with the probe said. Generally, the SEC's headquarters=
 office has more resources to apply to complex, high-profile cases than regi=
onal offices do. Moving the Enron inquiry to headquarters indicates that the=
 SEC is looking to make a decision relatively quickly about whether or not t=
o allege securities-law violations by the company, this person said.=20
Enron repeatedly has said the transactions were proper and legal. Yesterday,=
 the Enron spokeswoman said the company is continuing to cooperate with the =
SEC probe and is gathering and sending the agency information that it reques=
ted.=20
Moody's said the downgrade was "prompted by the deterioration in Enron's fin=
ancial flexibility," which has contributed to "a substantial loss in investo=
r confidence." Going forward, Moody's said it will focus on Enron management=
's "success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to r=
etain credit availability" from major trading partners. Enron is a principal=
 in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades in the nati=
on.

Enron Credit Rating Is Cut, And Its Share Price Suffers
By Bloomberg News

Shares of the Enron Corporation fell sharply yesterday after Moody's Investo=
rs Service lowered the company's credit rating, igniting concern that it mig=
ht have more difficulty raising the cash it needs to finance day-to-day oper=
ations.=20
Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt ratings to Baa2, two=
 levels above so-called junk status, from Baa1.
Moody's also said it might downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which =
could make it harder for the company, the nation's largest energy-trading co=
ncern, to borrow the short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in=
 the future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in commerci=
al paper last week. It is trying to raise $1 billion to $2 billion in additi=
onal financing from banks.=20
''A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their borrowing power,'' sai=
d Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne Hummer Investments in Chicago. '=
'That's not a good place for them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expan=
sion plans.''=20
Shares of Enron, which is based in Houston, plunged $1.59, or 10.3 percent, =
to $13.81, continuing the daily trading losses dating to Oct. 17, when Enron=
 reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of t=
rading commodities like electricity and natural gas.=20
The company's stock, which is down almost 60 percent in a week, is falling f=
aster than the company's debt because the bond holders have first claim on a=
ssets after bank loans are paid.=20
After the Moody's downgrade, the company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 200=
6 fell 4 cents, to 80 cents on each $1 of face value. Yields have risen to 1=
2.1 percent, up from 10.8 percent before that downgrade, traders said. The b=
onds were trading at face value the week before.=20
Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ''deterioration in Enron's financia=
l flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges. Investment partnerships i=
nvolving the company's former chief financial officer that had not been disc=
losed before this month ''led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,'=
' Moody's said.=20
Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial officer, resigned, and the Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission asked for information about the transactions he =
conducted for the partnerships he headed.=20
Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-rating reductio=
n. ''This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds Enron bonds in=
 the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps manage at the Mony Life Insu=
rance Company.=20
Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last week to negative f=
rom stable by Standard & Poor's. S.& P. affirmed the company's rating of BBB=
+, the equivalent of Moody's Baa1.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Private equity woes sap Enron's energy=20
Financial Times; Oct 30, 2001

Enron has just provided the world with another lesson in the difficulties of=
 public companies investing in private equity.=20
On October 16 the company's management announced a Dollars 1.01bn charge and=
 a Dollars 1.2bn reduction to shareholders' equity arising from LJM2 Co-Inve=
stment and LJM Cayman, two structured products designed to protect it agains=
t the fluctuation in value of its private equity investments.=20
Andrew Fastow, who was last week replaced as the chief financial officer of =
the Houston-based energy trading giant, set up a private equity fund called =
LJM, designed to fund Enron transactions.=20
LJM deals did not normally appear on Enron's balance sheet. And that may hav=
e been the point of the structure.=20
A financial engineer explained that Enron could have set up a fund, whose ch=
anging valuations did not increase the volatility of the trading company's e=
arnings, by taking only a minority stake in the LJM fund with some passive c=
o-investors.=20
The investors would normally receive a debt-like pay-off, except in cases wh=
ere the value of the private equity holdings fell, when they would get compe=
nsation in Enron shares.=20
The value of the portfolio, which included investments in The New Power Comp=
any and some broadband companies, did fall precipitously. By the end of last=
 quarter Enron was obliged to issue 62m shares to the passive investors to c=
ompensate them. But instead it ended up taking large cash charges.=20
Was it worth all this trouble for Enron to keep its volatile private equity =
holdings off its balance sheet? Obviously not.=20
Mr Fastow has now taken a leave of absence and the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission has launched an informal investigation into whether Enron's transa=
ctions with the LJM companies were really completed at arms' length. The com=
pany's market capitalisation has halved and its bonds are trading at distres=
sed levels.=20
But there could still be a good argument for Enron being in private equity. =
It is almost as much a technology company as it is an energy one and as such=
 it might make sense to outsource some of its research and development to a =
corporate venture capital unit.=20
The problem is shareholders' dim view of private equity. Shareholders refuse=
d to give Chase Manhattan Bank a growth multiple when venture capital made u=
p a large proportion of its earnings, but punished its successor, JP Morgan =
Chase, when it took a succession of private equity write-downs.=20
JP Morgan Chase claims a 40 per cent internal rate of return on its investme=
nts since inception. But investors have remained stubbornly fixated on priva=
te equity's short-term valuation swings.=20
The bank is now in the process of raising outside money for its private equi=
ty fund, JP Morgan Partners, in an effort to take some of its investment off=
 the balance sheet and change the business into a steady revenue producer.=20
Private equity professionals argue that those swings are often meaningless a=
nyway because half way through the life of many private equity investments, =
their valuations tend to look far worse than they end up.=20
In Enron's case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes o=
n the long term, if the short-term outlook had been a little clearer. The tr=
ading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to inves=
tors.=20
Ironically, the energy company's subtle balance sheet games may in the short=
 term have increased the allure of the company's trading businesses, which c=
ontinue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth. And for that r=
eason it could probably be argued that Mr Fastow thought he was serving Enro=
n's interests by managing the partnerships - although he is also reported to=
 have been very well compensated for the service.=20
Long-term the partnerships have clearly undermined Enron's reputation for pl=
ain dealing still further.=20
The saddest thing for the corporate world is that Enron is arguably a more n=
atural private equity investor than JP Morgan. As a financial institution, J=
P Morgan is arguably most interested in the short-term synergies private equ=
ity creates with its other businesses. High capital charges that bank privat=
e equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long-t=
erm investments.=20
Enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its ow=
n businesses grow. It was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of pr=
ivate equity to make its business grow.=20
The first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish Enron for i=
ts shenanigans. Later someone might want to think about changing the mark to=
 market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths.=20

Shares in Enron, the energy trading company, continued their downward spiral=
 yesterday, with investors responding coolly to reports that the Houston com=
pany was seeking new credit lines.=20
At midday the stock was down 9 per cent at $14.10.
Investor anger has been focused on Enron executives who still have much to e=
xplain about several off-balance-sheet vehicles and potential conflicts of i=
nterest for the company's former chief financial officer.=20
Wall Street analysts are beginning to rethink their overwhelmingly favourabl=
e guidance earlier in the year.=20
"If I could go back to July and downgrade the stock again, I would certainly=
 do that," said Curt Launer, analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "I can't=
 go back. The question is: what are you going to do today? Today, I would li=
ke to buy it because of the valuations."=20
Mr Launer continues to rate Enron as a "strong buy" and he is not alone. Des=
pite weeks of turbulent financial disclosures, the August departure of Enron=
's chief executive, Jeff Skilling, and the more recent departure of CFO Andr=
ew Fastow, analysts have wavered little in their initial bullishness.=20
Among analysts who issue recommendations on the company, nine are "strong bu=
ys", five are "buys" and only one is a "strong sell", according to Thomson F=
inancial/First Call.=20
There is no doubt the recent turmoil at Enron has created a new difficulty f=
or analysts. Do they hold on and hope for an upturn despite continued questi=
ons about the company's disclosure quality, or do they recommend that invest=
ors unload their holdings for fears that problems could mount?=20
They are defending their recommendations based on Enron's strong track recor=
d. Net income, on an operating basis, surged 32 per cent last year to $1.3bn=
, on revenues more than doubled to $101bn. During the past 15 years, Enron's=
 market capitalisation surged from $2bn to a peak of $70bn. Even today analy=
sts point to Enron's strong position in key sectors of power and gas trading=
=2E=20
However, at least one independent research firm decided to tell investors to=
 get out early. Off Wall Street Consulting Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts=
, put Enron on its "sell" list in early May when the shares traded just belo=
w $60.=20
"We discussed the partnerships (former CFO) Fastow was involved in and that =
there was not much detail there," said Mark Roberts, analyst at OWS. "Their =
accounting is extraordinarily difficult to get through and when people make =
things that difficult there's usually a reason."=20
Despite their relative optimism, most analysts say more bad news could follo=
w.=20
"The clear immediate task for Enron is to make sure it has enough liquidity =
to help maintain its credit rating," said Andre Meade, head of US utility re=
search at Commerzbank Securities.=20
Mr Meade issued a "hold" recommendation early last year, but has since upgra=
ded to "accumulate" as the stock became more affordable. "We've been saying =
the numbers have been coming in and they have been hitting earnings (estimat=
es), but (some of its) businesses are black boxes and you don't know how the=
 company is making money from quarter to quarter."=20
Yesterday a new note of caution was sounded by Carol Levenson, fixed-income =
analyst at Gimme Credit research group. "The ensuing total collapse of manag=
ement credibility and market confidence could have negative credit implicati=
ons far beyond the potential financial impact disclosed so far," she said.=20

WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Boeing brings Wall St back down to earth.

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

A stark reality checkswept Wall Street as investors sold off shares on the w=
idespread view that recent gains have yet to be justified by either corporat=
e or economic data.=20
The Dow Industrial Average had tumbled 213.05 to 9,332.12 by midsession, whi=
le the Nasdaq Composite lost 35.00 to 1,733.96. The broader S&P 500 index ed=
ged off 18.89 to 1,085.72.
Boeing fell 8.2 per cent to $34.59 in response to Friday's news that the Pen=
tagon had awarded the $200bn joint striker fighter contract to rival Lockhee=
d Martin.=20
Lockheed Martin gained 2.7 per cent to $51.28 on the news. The company is ex=
pected to hire 2,500 more staff over the life of the contract.=20
Analysts were hesitant to pinpoint the JSF contract news as a cause for yest=
erday morning's sell-off.=20
"This (sell-off) doesn't really seem to be event-specific," says Tom van Leu=
ven at JP MorganChase. "We've seen a strong bounce in recent weeks and the n=
ews flow doesn't support that...earnings have been bad and economic data isn=
't likely to be positive."=20
Also depressing the Dow was United Technologies, down 4.2 per cent at $54.60=
 even though its Pratt & Whitney engine unit is poised to gain from the JSF =
contract to Lockheed.=20
Shares of EchoStar retreated fractionally to $25.03 after the company's surp=
rise victory in the battle to acquire Hughes Electronics, the owner of the b=
iggest US satellite broadcaster, DirecTV and itself a General Motors unit. T=
he tracking stock for Hughes fell to $14.68, while General Motors stock retr=
eated to $43.35, a 4.5 per cent fall in both cases.=20
The ADRs of News Corp., the rival bidder to EchoStar, mirrored overnight los=
ses in Sydney and lost 6.5 per cent to $27.14.=20
UAL gained 4.8 per cent to $14.60 as its United Airlines unit announced that=
 Jack Creighton would take over as interim chairman and chief executive afte=
r James Goodwin stepped down.=20
FedEx, the shipping company, gained 4.7 per cent to $41.36 as it announced t=
hat its earnings would beat estimates, even though they would come in below =
figures for the comparable quarter last year.=20
In the energy sector, shares of Enron were down 8 per cent to $14.16 after t=
he beleaguered company announced it was seeking additional credit.=20
Toronto fell in early trading, hit by the weak opening for US equities and c=
oncern about loan provisions in the banking sector. The S&P 300 composite in=
dex was off 0.9 per cent at 6,942.60 at midsession.=20
Bank of Montreal fell 5 per cent or C$1.70 to C$33.00 following Friday's ann=

Moody's downgrades Enron debt=20
Move likely to hurt its leverage=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Enron Corp. saw its long-term debt rating lowered by one notch Monday, sendi=
ng the stock to seven-year lows and further hampering the company's efforts =
to restore investor and client confidence.=20
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's rating from Baa1 to Baa2, where=
 it will remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said in a statement=
=2E The firm also placed the Houston company's Prime-2 rating for commercial=
 paper on review for downgrade.=20
The Baa2 rating is just two notches above what are commonly called "junk bon=
ds," but in line with the ratings of other competing energy companies, Simmo=
ns & Co. International analyst Jeff Dietert noted.=20
"For example, El Paso is a Baa2, Mirant is Baa2, Calpine is Baa3," he said. =
"It's similar to the others in the industry."=20
Last Thursday another leading rating agency, Standard & Poor's, revised its =
outlook on Enron to negative while affirming its BBB-plus long-term rating. =
Ratings agency Fitch also put Enron on a negative watch. Those agencies have=
 not announced a decision on whether they will change their ratings.=20
Shares of Enron closed down $1.59 Monday at $13.81. In the past two weeks th=
e stock has lost more than half its value, dropping from as high as $35 at t=
he beginning of October.=20
Enron's rating had been on review by Moody's since Oct. 16, when the company=
's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to a pair of invest=
ment partnerships created by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
Analysts began to demand more details behind the complicated and previously =
overlooked workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide =
as quickly as some would have liked. The company said it was careful to ensu=
re that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but the =
Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an inf=
ormal inquiry into the partnerships.=20
Last week the company put Fastow on a leave of absence and named a replaceme=
nt, then began providing more details about its finances in order to maintai=
n investor and client confidence.=20
On Friday, Enron tapped a $3.3 billion line of revolving credit, putting abo=
ut $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure it has cash on hand. It is using the b=
alance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper -- a form of s=
hort-term IOUs the company issues to raise money at terms better than availa=
ble from banks.=20
That move was lauded by many analysts but also served as a sign that the com=
pany was having trouble convincing those who held its commercial paper to co=
ntinue renewing it at favorable terms.=20
Moody's move to lower Enron's credit rating could further complicate its abi=
lity to raise money and do business.=20
Credit ratings are used to rank companies in their ability pay their bills, =
pay interest on loans, cover shortfalls in earnings and conduct other fundam=
ental business functions, said Donald Singer, a professor of finance at the =
University of Houston. The better the ratings, the more strength a company h=
as when it negotiates financing terms with trading partners and the lower th=
e interest rates it can demand from lenders.=20
While rating agencies like Moody's closely guard the formulas they use to re=
ach their ratings, it's clear the write-downs and equity charges Enron took =
in the most recent fiscal quarter cast some doubt on the company's ability t=
o generate cash in the future, Singer said.=20
"The rating is less a matter of the psychology of the market and what it thi=
nks the company's stock is worth as it is what the business fundamentals of =
the firm are," Singer said.=20
The lower rating could lead trading partners to demand different terms with =
Enron and could lead to higher interest rates on a new multibillion-dollar l=
ine of revolving credit the company is negotiating with banks.=20
The issue of liquidity is crucial for a company that relies heavily on its c=
redit lines to conduct billions of dollars worth of trading deals on a daily=
 basis. On Oct. 24 alone, Enron conducted $4 billion in transactions through=
 its trading unit EnronOnline, a system widely used by energy traders.=20
While U.S. firms are continuing to trade with Enron at normal levels, Reuter=
s reported that several unnamed European energy companies have frozen their =
dealings with Enron in that market and others are keeping a wary eye on thei=
r activity with the firm.=20
Despite the downgrade, Singer and Dietert say Enron is far from slipping int=
o serious trouble with its energy trading partners. The bank credit lines un=
der negotiation and the $2 billion in cash expected to come with Enron's pen=
ding sale of Portland General Electric Co. are expected to reaffirm the comp=
any's liquidity.=20
The real questions are whether there are more troubling partnerships the com=
pany still hasn't revealed and if they will lead to more write-downs or char=
ges such as those that occurred last quarter. Moody's officials said they wi=
ll continue to review those off-balance-sheet transactions.=20
"I'd like to see some type of confirmation that there aren't other partnersh=
ips that could cause dilution or the issuance of preferred shares," Dietert =
said.=20
Newspaper reports last week on yet another such partnership came as a surpri=
se to analysts, leading many to ask if there are more they don't know about.=
 The partnership, called Chewco, was formed in 1997 with about $400 million =
in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets, and was run b=
y Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group=

Stocks sink amid trio of pressures

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

Bad things, it seems, often happen in threes. If that's so, Wall Street coul=
d be facing a bout of deja vu.=20
Three financial stories currently unfolding bear a slim resemblance to event=
s that nearly caused gridlock in global financial markets in 1998. The analo=
gy is strained, but so are nerves in the post-Sept. 11 era. Case in point: T=
he Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 275 points Monday--its bigges=
t point loss since the week after markets reopened following the attacks--de=
spite a lack of dramatically downbeat news.
One of the closely watched sagas on Wall Street, the deepening problems at e=
nergy trading innovator Enron, is being compared to the tragically flawed Lo=
ng-Term Capital Management private investment fund.=20
At Long-Term Capital, professional investors with impressive resumes made a =
series of disastrous bets, requiring a government- induced bailout in 1998 b=
y major financial institutions that had financed their schemes with massive =
loans.=20
On Monday, Houston-based Enron struggled to raise emergency cash as its stoc=
k fell another 10 percent, to $13.81.=20
Enron shares, which have fallen from above $80 at the end of last year, have=
 collapsed more than 50 percent this month as analysts began to question mys=
terious financial deals between the company and company insiders. Last week,=
 Enron's chief financial officer was replaced.=20
There was no indication Monday that Enron's troubles have impaired the natur=
al gas and electricity markets. Nor has the Enron predicament yet sparked a =
backdraft on its lenders.=20
The two other strings of the story--debt problems at a sovereign nation and =
currency imbalances--seem relevant only by coincidence.=20
The implosion at Long-Term Capital occurred amid a surprise default by Russi=
a on international debts. Separately, currencies of several Asian countries =
ran aground a second year, events that deepened Long-Term Capital's woes.=20
Current speculation that Argentina will default on $132 billion of internati=
onal debts hardly represents a shock similar to the Russian debt default. Th=
e problems of Argentina's economy and financial system, while serious, have =
been well-known for months.=20
On Monday, Argentina hired a Merrill Lynch consultant, Jacob Frankel, to cra=
ft a financial restructuring and said a workout plan will be disclosed in a =
few days.=20
Meanwhile, Monday's slide in the value of the dollar in foreign currency mar=
kets reversed the dollar's surprising strength in the wake of the attacks.=20
Indeed, the relative stability of the dollar has been a major contributor to=
 investor confidence. The current slippage by the dollar hardly indicates ex=
traordinary instability.=20
As far as we know, Enron was not engaged in currency speculation or deals pe=
gged to Argentina. But Enron shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission have just begun to investigate.=20
Monday's action: Stocks closed broadly lower in light trading Monday, as inv=
estors awaited several key economic reports due out this week, including Fri=
day's scheduled report on job losses and the unemployment rate in October.=20
Treasury securities rallied on expectations that the economic downturn will =
be more pronounced and longer than many investors believe and will prompt th=
e Federal Reserve to cut interest rates through the end of the year.=20
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 275.67 points, or 2.9 percent, to 9269=
=2E50. Chicago-based Boeing, which lost a major defense contract to rival Lo=
ckheed Martin, led the Dow losers. Boeing lost $3.93, or 10.4 percent, to $3=
3.75.=20
Only one of the 30 Dow industrials, SBC Communications, posted a gain.=20
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 26.31, or 2.4 percent, to 10=
78.30. New York Stock Exchange trading volume reached 1.11 billion shares, a=
s losing stocks outnumbered winners by 2-1.=20
The Nasdaq composite index fell 69.44, or 3.9 percent, to 1699.52. Nasdaq tr=
ading volume totaled 1.67 billion shares. Losers topped winners by nearly 2-=
1 among Nasdaq stocks.=20
Computer networking giant Cisco Systems led the Nasdaq most- active list, dr=
opping 87 cents, to $16.42. A.G. Edwards revoked its "strong buy" rating on =
the stock.=20
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks lost 9.24, or 2.1 percent, to=
 429.41.=20
Fund flows: Mutual fund investors withdrew a net $29.5 billion from equity f=
unds in September, the biggest one-month dollar amount for net redemptions, =
according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for mut=
ual funds.=20
The redemptions equaled less than 1 percent of assets in stock funds, compar=
ed with more than 3 percent withdrawn in October 1987, reflecting the stock =
market crash of that month. By contrast, cash flow last month into money-mar=
ket funds soared by $53 billion.=20
Treasury auction: Interest rates fell again at the Treasury's weekly auction=
 of 3-month and 6-month bills.=20
The discount rate for 3-month bills was 2.05 percent, the lowest rate since =
August 1958. The rate for 6-month bills was 2.00 percent, the lowest rate on=

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Exelon Corp. (EXC) hasn't made specific moves to lower=
 its trading operation's exposure to Enron Corp. (ENE), but it's carefully e=
valuating dealings with Enron in light of the trading giant's recent trouble=
s, a top Exelon official said Monday.=20
"We have been very careful to check all of our trades with them to make cert=

Chicago-based Exelon, said following a speech at an energy conference. "Obvi=
ously we're concerned that if they have big problems, it would really shake =

Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after the company discl=

 as one reason for the downgrade. Enron shares closed Monday at $13.81, down=
 $1.59, or 10%, on above-average volume of 36.4 million shares. Enron's shar=
es are off 60% since mid-October.=20
Despite Enron's recent problems, Exelon hasn't made specific moves to lower =
its risk exposure to the company, Rowe said. He said he doesn't believe Enro=

"I am not in a panic over Enron," he said. "Personally, I would be very surp=

Power Suppliers Urge Changes in U.S. Price-Cap Rules for West
2001-10-29 19:00 (New York)

Power Suppliers Urge Changes in U.S. Price-Cap Rules for West

     Washington, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Companies that sell power
in the western U.S. said the region may face blackouts this winter
unless federal regulators permit them to charge more for
electricity than current price limits allow.

     Dynegy Inc., Enron Corp. and other power suppliers said they
may not have electricity to offer during regional shortages this
winter if the price caps that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission set for California and 10 Western states in April and
June aren't eliminated or changed. They said the present limit may
be too low to encourage dam owners to generate electricity.

     ``The price mitigation plan, the way it is now, will make it
difficult to induce supply,'' G. Alan Comnes, director of
government affairs for Enron Power Marketing, told the commission
at a conference in Washington.

     The commission is considering changes to the pricing formula
it set after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for
California's largest utilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International. Commissioners have said they want to fine-tune the
formula before winter, the peak period of demand in the Northwest.

     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensive
power generated in California. Power suppliers and utilities in
the Pacific Northwest, which want to make sure they have enough
power for customers, want the limits to reflect costs from all
generators in the region.

     Representatives for the California Public Utilities
Commission and Edison International's Southern California Edison
said the price limits work and should be continued. California
PUC's Bill Julian said the mitigation plan, due to expire Sept.
30, 2002, should be extended until California's utilities are
rehabilitated.

                           Prices Lower

     The cost of wholesale power in California has dropped since
FERC ordered the first emergency cap on April 25. The average
price for a megawatt-hour at the California-Oregon border in
September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April. A megawatt-hour
is enough electricity to power about 750 average California homes
for an hour.

     One adjustment under consideration would link the pricing
formula to the cost of natural gas, a fuel used to generate about
25 percent of power in the western U.S., more during low-
hydropower years.

     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,
Montana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators in
the West could simply get around the cap by selling outside
California when prices were higher elsewhere.

INDIA PRESS: Enron Close To Deal To Sell Dabhol Pwr Proj

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) is in an advan=
ced stage of negotiations to sell its Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., at a 30=
% discount to financial institutions at a price likely between $700 million-=
$800 million, reports the Economic Times, quoting unnamed sources.=20
The business daily says Enron and the financial institutions, led by the Ind=

greement within the next few days. The final settlement should be worked out=
 before Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the U.S. in th=
e second week of November, according to the report.
Should the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year paymen=
t plan in equal instalments to minimize a heavy one-time foreign exchange tr=
ansfer, says the report.=20
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state=
 of Maharashtra. Enron holds a 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the p=
roject is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.=20

FERC Warns That Power-Price Controls Risk Shortages in Northwest
By Bryan Lee

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires=20
WASHINGTON -- The Pacific Northwest could see power shortages this winter if=
 federal price controls on western power markets aren't modified or dropped,=
 electricity industry officials warned federal regulators Monday.
The controls, first structured to protect California from another punishing =
summer, are inappropriate to the Northwest, where demand is highest in the w=
inter, the officials said.=20
"The Western Interconnection is an interdependent market, but that does not =
mean that there is or should be a single price across the market," said Rich=
ard Tabors, a consultant to power suppliers and a lecturer at Massachusetts =
Institute of Technology. "Setting prices in the winter-peaking Northwest bas=
ed on prices set in summer-peaking California and the Southwest makes little=
 sense."=20
The caution came at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission technical confere=
nce designed to help the agency frame possible changes to a June price-contr=
ol order capping prices in California and 10 other Western states.=20
The controls work by establishing a proxy for a fair maximum market price fo=
r the entire region based on the most expensive generator called into servic=
e during power emergencies in California. The proxy-price formula takes into=
 account the cost of natural gas fuel, emissions-control credits and the eff=
iciency of power plants.=20
But California, which experiences peak demand for electricity in the summer,=
 is unlikely to run into a supply crunch again until next year. That means t=
he price cap set in June will remain in effect throughout the winter, when t=
he Pacific Northwest experiences its peak-demand period and may need the fle=
xibility to pay higher prices to attract needed power.=20
If the current price-control regime is maintained, it will discourage sales =
from the Southwest to the Northwest this winter, because transmission costs =
will drive the cost of those sales above FERC's price cap, Mr. Tabors said.=20
California Wants Caps To Stay=20
Officials representing California and its financially beleaguered utilities =
urged the commission to maintain the price-control order and to extend it be=
yond its October 2002 expiration date to prevent a recurrence of last year's=
 power-market meltdown.=20
The price-control regime should remain in place at least until California's =
utilities return to the market as creditworthy buyers, said Fong Wan of PG&E=
 Corp. (PCG) and Bill Julian of the California Public Utilities Commission.=20
A 10% markup allowed to compensate for credit risks for sales into Californi=
a should be dropped, because the California Department of Water Resources, a=
 creditworthy buyer, is purchasing electricity on behalf of the utilities, t=
hey said.=20
FERC's price-mitigation order "has been very successful," said Gary Stern of=
 Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison Co.=20
Prices stabilized shortly after the controls took effect and have been cappe=
d at $92 per megawatt-hour since late June, the last time the California Ind=
ependent System Operator, the state's grid manager, called an alert. Conserv=
ation, mild weather and California's entry into billions of dollars in long-=
term power contracts have kept market prices well below that cap for the mos=

FERC, however, is considering changing the pricing order to reflect the diff=
erent needs of western utilities outside California. The commission is mulli=
ng whether power prices should change at times other than when California de=
clares an emergency, perhaps to reflect fluctuations in natural gas prices.=20
FERC also is pondering changes to the requirement that generators make all u=
ncommitted power available to California at all times. FERC staff asked whet=
her the so-called must-sell requirement should apply only during emergencies=
 and whether the mandate should be balanced by a "must-pay" requirement.=20
Generators have complained that the state still hasn't paid for hundreds of =
millions of dollars worth of power delivered since the Department of Water R=
esources took over the job of purchasing power for customers of California's=
 largest utilities.=20
California Focus Challenged=20
Absent withdrawal of FERC's price-mitigation order, Mr. Tabors and other con=
ference participants argued for changes in the order to better account for t=
he predominance of hydropower generation in the Northwest.=20
Setting prices throughout the West based on prices in California, which gets=
 most of its power from natural gas-fired generating plants, runs the risk o=
f supply shortages in the Northwest this winter, they said.=20
Utilities operating hydropower facilities won't know how much generating cap=
acity they'll have for next year until February, when a reliable assessment =
of snowpack will be available. Given the uncertainty, hydropower operators w=
ill be reluctant to release water for generation this winter.=20
"Shortages can happen this winter," said Mike Naeve, an attorney with Skadde=
n Arps Meaghre & Flom representing Portland General Electric Co., a unit of =
Enron Corp. (ENE). "Prices based on natural gas may not be sufficient to rel=
ease hydro you may need next year."=20
Under the current regime, the California Independent System Operator, contro=
lled by appointees of Gov. Gray Davis, could "manipulate the market by contr=
olling exports to the Northwest," said Alan Comnes of Enron Power Marketing =
Inc. (ENE). "The current price mitigation is sowing the seeds for another cr=
isis."=20
FERC's pricing order has already been costly, said Mark Tallman of Scottish =
Power's PacifiCorp (SPI). If there is an Arctic cold snap in the region this=
 winter, price caps set by the California ISO may be insufficient to assure =
enough supply, he said.=20
FERC should allow prices to rise to $250 per megawatt-hour price cap in the =
Northwest if capacity margins drop to emergency levels, Mr. Tallman said.=20
Mr. Tabors and the Enron officials recommended FERC adopt a $1,000 per megaw=
att-hour "circuit breaker" cap, such as exists in ISO-administered markets i=
n Texas and the Northeast.=20
FERC's pricing order also was criticized for failing to account for the econ=
omics of "peaker" generating units, which only run during periods of peak de=
mand, when prices typically spike.=20
