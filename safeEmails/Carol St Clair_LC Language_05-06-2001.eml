Jay:
Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later=20
this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might=20
help me if you could describe how the margining will work.  Typically there=20
is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anythin=
g=20
over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.  In addition, there=
=20
is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold t=
o=20
zero.  Is that how yours will work?
