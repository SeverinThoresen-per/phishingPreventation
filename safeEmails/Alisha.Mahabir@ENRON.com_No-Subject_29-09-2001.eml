Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Ma=
rketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse th=
at ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, offic=
er, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whe=
ther the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This i=
s the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxi=
ous to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasibl=
e.

Thanks,

Alisha
