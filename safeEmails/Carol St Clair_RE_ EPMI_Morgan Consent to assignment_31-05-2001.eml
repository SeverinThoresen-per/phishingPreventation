Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant=20
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment. =20
However, as a result of=20
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan=20
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we hav=
e=20
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy=20
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions=20
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to includ=
e=20
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue=20
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy =20
