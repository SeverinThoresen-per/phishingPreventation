We have struck common commercial ground with Bloomberg after all these month=
s, however, there is still a technical obstacle.  This meeting's objective i=
s to introduce our QDF and let them know what they have to build to.

Due to resource constraints this is not a deal we would consider until later=
 in the year IF it requires additional development.  For now, your assistanc=
e in "selling" the QDF architecture would be valuable.

Is there anyone else you would include?
