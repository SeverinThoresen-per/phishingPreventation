Hi
    =20
     I guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for!  Since you=20
helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the All=20
Products
section of stack manager ,  I can no longer select a financial swap product=20
as a link to my physical products.  For example, I would like to link my=20
HEHUB physical=20
rest of month product to the gas daily HEHUB swap product.  Can you help me=20
once again or refer me to someone who can?  Sorry, I did not realize these=20
options were connected.


                                                                            =
 =20
                                      Thanks in advance for your help!
