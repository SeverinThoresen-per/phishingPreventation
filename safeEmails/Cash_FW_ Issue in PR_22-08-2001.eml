Michelle:

Here are two good responses regarding the issue about which you called me
this morning.

I researched this issue under federal criminal law and did not find any duty
to report. You should know, though, that the penalties are pretty draconian.
Tell your client not to print anything, forward anything, etc. Just delete
it all.

Per the recent news stories re the arrest of individuals who have downloaded
child porn, the possession of same is itself unlawful, so the client should
systematically dispossess itself of it.  Brian

I received no comments to the contrary regarding these.  Thus, it appears
that you can delete the material and go forward.  I will do a little more
checking and get back to you with any supplements.  We have not checked the
law of PR, do you want me to do that?
