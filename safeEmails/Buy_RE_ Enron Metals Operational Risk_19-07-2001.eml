David and Rick,

I am following up with people in London to gain a better understanding of th=
e cause of this operational loss.  I have been assured that several process =
changes have been implemented to correct the underlying problem, but I will =
also get enough additional details to make my own assessment. =20

Thanks,
Wanda=20
