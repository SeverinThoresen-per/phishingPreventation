The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities =
that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need =
to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a go=
od idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the fin=
al amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I ha=
ve not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

The kuo's are having their attorney look at the agreement.  They need to
transfer their onwership into a LLP with your consent before they can sign
the agreement.  Pauline is contacting the bank for their consent also.  You
may need to sign a consent form to transfer the LLP.  I will keep you
posted.
