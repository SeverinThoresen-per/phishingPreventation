I know you guys are all very busy right now, but we are trying to move forwa=
rd on the Doorstep activities.

Last I heard you and Rick Causey definitely wanted us to do the London ones.

Any help you can provide in terms of finding a RAC resource to help on this =
on  would be appreciated.

Dear Ted,

We are all set for the metals doorstep to be performed the week of Nov. 5th =
with the exception of a name for the RAC resource.  We are starting to plan =
the review and would like to involve RAC.  Who have you designated as the RA=
C resource (Brenda Herod from Operations will be the person responsible from=
 the operations side)? =20

I'd like to get Brenda and RAC together some time this week if possible.

Thanks!
