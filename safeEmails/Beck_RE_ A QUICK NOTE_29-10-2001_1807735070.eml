Sally

Hope all is going well in your new role as COO (and they are not working you=
 too hard !)

As you know the European Office is currently undergoing a restructuring with=
 voluntary redundancies etc.

I am currently working in EBS Europe as controller for Mid/Back Office - I h=
ave responsibilities for the following functions:-
- Contract Mgt / Documentation
- Risk Mgt
- Settlements
- Trade Accounting & Financial Reporting

This covers basically the whole of the Mid/Back office function.
Now EBS in Europe is not looking in good shape at the moment (with only 3 tr=
ades completed last month, and the whole of the Telecoms industry in a bit o=
f a recession - with no indicators asto when this will change), so I think n=
ow is the time to start looking at other opportunities that may be available=
 in other Enron business units.

As you may already know I have 9 years experience in Enron (7 yrs PQE since =
qualifying as a Accountant) gained in Finance, Structuring, new business set=
-ups (Gas, Continental Power, J-Block, EBS).

I have already spoken to Fernley Dyson & Barry Pearce as to what roles may b=
e available in Enron (they are both getting back to me) and was wondering if=
 you had knowledge of any other roles, given my particular skill-set both he=
re in Europe and the US.

If you can't think of anything it doesn't matter - just though I would drop =
you a note on the off-chance.
But if you can think of any areas or have the names of people I could contac=
t I would be most grateful

Thanks

Neil
