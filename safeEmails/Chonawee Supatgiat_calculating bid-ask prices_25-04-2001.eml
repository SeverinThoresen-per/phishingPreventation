This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for=20
trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many=20
people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide=20
some feedback.

I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We=
=20
can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process".
In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is=20
submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final=20
(clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to=20
the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the=20
final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)

I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via=20
EnronOnline.com.

Subject: calculating bid-ask prices


I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to=20
forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market,=20
we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some=
=20
positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with th=
e=20
studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the=20
price easily.

One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange=20
system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading=20
period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post=20
"tentative" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their=20
acceptable buying or selling price. These "tentative" bid-ask prices get=20
updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdra=
w=20
their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we=20
calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lowe=
r=20
selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer=
=20
who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask=20
price. Next week, we repeat the same process.

This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a=20
broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those=20
bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and=20
insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market=
=20
be the one who decides the price.=20

If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual=20
gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers=20
with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the=20
mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

Thanks,
-Chonawee

Hi Rich and Key,
Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, ca=
n=20
reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the "mark-to-market"=20
charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the=20
gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way=20
as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the=20
couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.
In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined=20
from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price=20
should go up.)
We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.
