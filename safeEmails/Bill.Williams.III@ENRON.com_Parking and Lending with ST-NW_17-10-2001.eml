Group,

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one =
point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take ene=
rgy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy =
from them at Mid-C.=20

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to =
or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule =
the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the cas=
e below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-=
C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any q=
uestions.

Thanks,
Bill

e manner possible.  Deal #821995.1
