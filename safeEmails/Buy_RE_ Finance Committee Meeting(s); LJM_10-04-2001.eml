Probably unnecessary to attend regularly from my point of view but I have no=
 issue either way. I think it is a good idea to meet monthly with Causey. Ri=

Rick: As you may recall, Andy had asked me to attend the Audit and Finance C=
ommittee meetings at the last Board meeting.  I was curious whether you thou=
ght it was a good idea for me to attend the Finance Committee meetings on a =
going forward basis (in the event of any LJM  discussion, or otherwise)?  I =
would be happy to do so, but my feelings won't be bruised if you think it un=
necessary.


On a somewhat related point, during my last meeting with Rick Causey of abou=
t two weeks ago, Rick suggested that the three of us get together monthly to=
 discuss what transactions are being discussed with LJM (or may have even cl=
osed during that time period), our related internal reviews, and documentati=
on.  Are you ok with this arrangement?

Thanks.
