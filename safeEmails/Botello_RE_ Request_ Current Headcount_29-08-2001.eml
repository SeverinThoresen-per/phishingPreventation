This is Saunders entire world plus Borcyk's world for tax.   Accounting and =
Reporting are consolidated, not worth splitting and the cost estimate should=
 be a net Enron estimate.

Call Kirk Stevens for the Portland info and Tod (unless you know who else) f=
or the EREC world.   What about Wessex?=20

Lets discuss this before I start pulling data.  I want to make sure I pull i=
n the right groups.  I have a call into Corp to try to figure out what they =
are getting at here.

Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Cause=
y is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most cu=
rrent headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). =
=20

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately=
 reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accoun=
ting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departm=
ents.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example,=
 Sally Beck's world).  I say "department" because I don't want just accounta=
nts, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you hav=
e a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll d=
iscuss.

The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of=
 July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a=
 bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting=
, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e=
=2E by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challen=
ge given the timing of the request. =20

Additionally, if you can provide me with a "current estimate" for the groups=
 you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to=
 that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects y=
our G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is seco=
ndary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you =
can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so w=
e can discuss.

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  Thi=
s will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to conso=
lidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,=20
Steve
