Before we spend any money, I'll pull together the market info to determine i=
f there is enough residual value/liquidity data to support a story that the =
loan would be secured.

With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primaril=
y the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find=
 a deal structure both sides could live with. I would hope costs would be lo=
wer on future additions. Having said that, though, the underlying inventory =
items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liqui=
dity. To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value =
upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more enron ri=
sk in the financing. In the current environment, I am less than confident I =
could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly. Jim, can you stay point on thi=
s exercise for the ercs and other items. Thanks.
