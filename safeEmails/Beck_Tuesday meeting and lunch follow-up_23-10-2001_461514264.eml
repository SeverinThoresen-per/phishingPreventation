Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given =
negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reacti=
on (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well atte=
nded and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a=
 meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions=
 on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting. =20

I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can =
be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I=
 think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a v=
isible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a gr=
oup of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the confe=
rence room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-=
employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the =
possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consis=
tant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I =
discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.

Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send=
 a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.  Beth Perlman suggest=
ed that we included Senior Directors and above.  Are you two okay with this?=
