We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer woul=
d not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what=
 was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is=
 in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation d=
ata and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide tot=
als of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Le=
t me know if you have questions.

Which deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be work=
ing on the draft agreement?

Thanks.

Michelle

We need a list of all benefit plans of any "to be" Newco employee.  We also =
rep that we have made these available to the purchaser.  I believe you said =
that the actual documents were available somewhere, so I assume that the oth=
er side could see them?
