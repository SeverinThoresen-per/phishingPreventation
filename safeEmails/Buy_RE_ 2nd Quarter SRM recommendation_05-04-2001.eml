Rudi- I still have a hard time visualizing the risk here, other than pure di=
lution, which I guess we care about. There must be a way to communicate this=
 issue graphically or with an example presented on a well thought out spread=
sheet. If you (we) don't figure out a way to communicate the problem here we=
 have no chance of winning the battle. Rick

Rick,

Although ENE is now trading in the $50 range, there is an opportunity to tak=
e advantage of this downturn in our stock value.  Our Enron Stock Option Pla=
n is monstruously short calls to employees (approximately 45 MM share equiva=
lent in vested, exercisable options).  Over the past few years the stock has=
 traded significantly higher, which has created a large economic loss in the=
 form of potential stock dilution.

In recent weeks, we have worked extensively with members of Fastow and Cause=
y's organization and have been discussing various strategies to mitigate / d=
ampen the dilution effect.  The outstanding issues include:

1.) Banks are approaching their ENE credit limit

2.) There is a tradeoff between accounting and economic value. =20

We feel that the decision to hedge this program should be influenced by the =
implied view on the future performance of our stock.  SRM's goal is to creat=
e a proposal that will outline the costs/benefits to hedging the stock optio=
n program.  In addition, we are in the process of developing a model to iden=
tify the various decision inflection points.  My biggest concern is that we =
will not be able to influence senior management before the stock price begin=
s to increase again.=20

I wanted to give you a head's up in case Causey and/or Fastow start discussi=
ng this issue. =20

     =20
      Rudi
