Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and =
the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with Lond=
on that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy o=
f it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a=
 cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last=
 week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop tradin=
g, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr=E9dit Ag=
ricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with E=
nron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International=
=2E

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with t=
hem.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the ene=
rgy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila
