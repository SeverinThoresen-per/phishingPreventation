John and Louise,

I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed the Beaver Creek offsite and to =
thank you for the invitation.   I think everyone was impressed with how well=
 this trip was organized - it was first class all the way.  The recreational=
 and social activities were fun, the meetings were informative, and the rela=
tionships that were formed and strengthened with other business unit leaders=
 should prove invaluable. =20

Thanks again!

Craig Breslau
