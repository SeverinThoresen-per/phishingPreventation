Hey, would you like for me to bring your recliner home next time I go up?  I
think Debbie and I can get it into your apartment.  Thought it might be
comfortable for you to kick back in after you have recuperated from the
surgery.  I have to go and get a haircut.  I still have my fifteen chin
whiskers!  I just keep them trimmed short and neat.  Takes about ten seconds
to do that.  Baby likes them though.  She does not want me to ever shave
them fifteen little rascals off ever!!!

Bye,
me

Hey  Buddy,

I am not for sure  if you remember Leon Simple.? He was the black man which
worked for Dad at  Dow Track Maint.? Leon lived over by McNeil Bridge on
the Brazoria side of  the San Bernard.? He has been over to the house in
Shady Acres  before.? At any rate, he died this past Sunday morning with a
massive heart  attack.? I sent a Flower Basket on behalf of the Sons Of
Wheeler Germany,  Don, Jerry and Chris.

Take  Care,

Don
