Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a=20
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HP=
L=20
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at=20
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request=20
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

Clement
