Later today, the SCADA system and associated databases used to run our pipel=
ine will be cut over from St. Rose to Hayes Road. The move should be largely=
 transparent to us. Energy and volumetric data for yesterday should be unaff=
ected.
=20
However, as with any significant change, there is a chance for unexpected pr=
oblems. We will be monitoring the cutover and working with ChevronTexaco to =
help ensure a smooth transition. We will inform you if unexpected problems d=
evelop that affect pipeline control or data availability and integrity.

If you access the SCADA applications home page, note that the address is cha=
nging from <http://144.5.254.33/> to <http://144.5.254.92>.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
