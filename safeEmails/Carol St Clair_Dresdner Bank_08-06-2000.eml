Rhett:
I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directl=
y=20
about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the=20
language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.  I have enclosed belo=
w=20
the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not=20
accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps. =20
Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier fo=
r=20
the tax folks to talk directly to each other.
Carol
