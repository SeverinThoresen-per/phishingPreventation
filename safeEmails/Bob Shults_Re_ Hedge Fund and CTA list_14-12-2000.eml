Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue i=
s=20
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectu=
s=20
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents=
=20
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic=20
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent=20
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates=
=20
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term=20
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in,=20
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of=20
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of=20
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge=
=20
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying=20
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past=20
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested:=
=20
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federa=
l=20
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to=20
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a=20
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the=20
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the=20
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or=20
individuals - for similar reasons). =20

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their=20
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Mark

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments,=
=20
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge=
=20
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets,=20
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it=20
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible=20
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA=20
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets=20
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not=20
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing=20
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this=20
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that=20
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional=
=20
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing=20
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original=20
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary=20
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized=20
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other=
=20
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an=20
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of thes=
e=20
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a=20
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House,=20
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trad=
e=20
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimatel=
y=20
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements,=20
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be=20
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be=20
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such=20
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert=20
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its=20
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedg=
e=20
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets=
=20
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would=20
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :



The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities=20
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :



I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above=20
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into.=20
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am=20
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information=20
please call me.
