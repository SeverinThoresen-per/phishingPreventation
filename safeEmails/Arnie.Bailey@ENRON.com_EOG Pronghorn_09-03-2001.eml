Earl,
Do you know where we stand on getting this equipment installed?  Besides the=
 GC, Del Mar, Water Monitor, there is still no power at the location.  We al=
so have no positive shut-in or overpressure protection.  According to Bennie=
, EOG plans to tie in another well.  We're already flowing 30mmcfd.  I appre=
ciate anything you can do to speed this up.
Thanks,  Arnie

onghorn station, they are now in the process of putting a second well into t=
hat line, the volume is not known at this time, but we still have not heard =
anything about a time line for getting the GC, Del Mar, dewpoint instrument =
or building.  We talked to Rich last month and he in return talked to Earl, =

ow any changes out here , like the addition of a new well.
