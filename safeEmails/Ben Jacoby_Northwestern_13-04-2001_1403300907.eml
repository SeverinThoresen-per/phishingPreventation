Folks:

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it=
=20
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM=20
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, w=
e=20
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal=20
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1,=20
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take=20
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2.=20
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monda=
y=20
would be appreciated.

Regards,

Ben=20
