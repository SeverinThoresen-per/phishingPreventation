Dear Tracy Geaccone,

/nov1901-streamer/odot.gif>	Now Streamer
 real-time quotes can be as individual as you are - each and every time you =
log on to trade.

Our new Quick Launch feature <http://datek2.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB4845574550X1153=
469X83727X> lets you load, arrange and save your favorite Streamer
 screens onto your desktop. Customize these screens to fit your trading pref=
erences. Save what you like and you'll save valuable time by returning to yo=
ur favorite screen every time you open Streamer
=2E

Also new at Streamer
: our Actives applet <http://datek2.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB4845574550X1153470X8372=
7X> that lists the 10 most active stocks within parameters you choose. Choos=
e your criteria, time interval and market - The Island ECN
 or activity among Datek customers - and Streamer
 Actives does the rest!

You can also save screen space with smaller font sizes and resizable applets=
, or use Streamer
 hotkeys - back by popular demand.
